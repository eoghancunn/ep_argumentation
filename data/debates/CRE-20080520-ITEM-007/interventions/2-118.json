The first is the River Danube, which, through its connection to both ends of the continent, links the North Sea with the Black Sea. Its potential is far from being exploited partly because the situation in the former Yugoslavia – situated in a central position of the river – has been blocking any initiative. But with the prospect of a final solution so close it will be difficult to justify the lack of a comprehensive initiative to transform the Danube into the very waterway of the continent, bringing further economic development to its shores all along its course.\nThe second aspect is mainly political. The maritime approaches to the Union are shared with countries which are not Member States. Therefore the EU has to see to it that its neighbourhood policy and its instruments are so designed as to further the aims of an ambitious target of an integrated comprehensive maritime strategy.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ioan Mircea Paşcu (PSE). – Madam President, in my intervention I would like to emphasise two aspects which I consider very important.
