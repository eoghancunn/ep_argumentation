{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, honourable Members, the engaging debate and the range of interesting points you raised clearly demonstrate the commitment of this Parliament to move forward the agenda of the integrated maritime policy for the Union.\nI assure you that the Commission fully shares this commitment. Many speakers raised the point that we have not gone far enough in our proposals and that we could and should have been even more ambitious. I take these comments as a sign of your real conviction that this policy is one that will be a success and will make a significant difference to the millions of European Union citizens and stakeholders that are affected by our oceans.\nLet me reiterate that this is only the beginning of a whole process and that at this stage our primary focus is to ensure that we have the tools in place in the short term to be able to develop and direct the process in the right direction. This is therefore the main thrust of the action plan adopted by the Commission last October.\nOn the issue of financing, I agree with Mr Queiró that financing is a key issue that will have an impact on the success of this policy. Thus far we have mobilised financing from savings made in policy areas such as fisheries. This was not to the detriment of fisheries programmes but due to savings and unused money. The issue of future funding of the integrated maritime policy will be a crucial one in the discussions and in the future financial perspectives.\nLet me now turn to a few specific points that have been raised and on which I would like to give an immediate comment. I would like, however, to assure you that we will give full consideration to all the points that have been mentioned during the course of this debate.\nWith regard to emissions by ships I would like to recall the very significant agreement that has just been reached within IMO on SOx and on NOx. I would like now to have more focus on CO 2 and we should do so first within the IMO and, if this fails, we would have the obligation to act ourselves.\nOn the point that was raised by Mr Jarzembowski concerning the European coastguard, to whom I paid particular attention, I would like to underline that this is a very sensitive matter. However, I foresee the development of a coordinated mechanism of national coastguards or of surveillance systems.\nWith regard to the fuel price increases, let me reiterate that this is certainly not due to any measures taken by Brussels, but it is an international problem and it is a new reality. We are doing our utmost to find appropriate solutions to help the sectoral structure and to face up to this reality. We have just reached agreement in fact with France in this regard and I am sure that details of this agreement will be made public in the coming days.\nOn the issue of piracy, of course the Commission is deeply concerned that incidents are on the increase. We see a need and an opportunity for mutual assistance and support among the EU membership to face this threat and await further direction from the Council and from the Member States themselves on this.\nI also agree with those who have made calls for more regional approaches and we will be working in this direction. Our project on surveillance in the western Mediterranean is based on such a regional approach and we hope it can serve as an example to be extended to other regions. In fact we will be looking at the maritime policy for the Baltic and Black Seas, which has been referred to by a number of speakers this morning, as we have just started to do with regard to the Mediterranean.\nI do not have time to outline the actions already taken or envisaged in the short term on fisheries like IEU, the structural fishing practices, the ecosystem approach, discards, port strategy, maritime transport, marine maritime research, the marine environment, energy, governance, surveillance or the social exclusion of seafarers, all of which we are dealing with. However, I can assure you that the Commission’s commitment to push forward this new policy hand in hand with Parliament in particular and with the Member States and stakeholders is guaranteed.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, honourable Members, the engaging debate and the range of interesting points you raised clearly demonstrate the commitment of this Parliament to move forward the agenda of the integrated maritime policy for the Union.\nI assure you that the Commission fully shares this commitment.
