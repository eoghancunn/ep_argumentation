{"speaker": "Derek Roland Clark,", "english": "Derek Roland Clark, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, this report is a long catalogue of failure. It graphically illustrates how the amount of fraud, described as ‘irregularities’, is steadily rising and that attempts to deal with it are failing. It openly admits that fraud in 2006 in the areas of own resources – agricultural expenditure and Member States’ structural actions – totalled EUR 1 143 million. It was EUR 922 million in 2003, so in just four years fraud has risen by over EUR 200 million.\nI would remind everyone in this institution that these are not meaningless sums of money, but taxpayers’ money. The EU is funded by its citizens, including hard-pressed taxpayers in the UK. They deserve better than this for their money. Governments of all Member States should be saying ‘enough’ already, and these appalling figures provide all the more reason why the government of my country should honour its manifesto commitment to give the British people a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Derek Roland Clark, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, this report is a long catalogue of failure.
