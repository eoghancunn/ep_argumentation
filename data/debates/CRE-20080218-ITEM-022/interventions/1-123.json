That will probably also help in all our future debates on discharge, and of course all the three reports – including the next one – are all very closely interrelated.\nSecondly, I have raised this issue with the Council Presidency, and asked it to consider this parliamentary report during its proceedings, by which I mean to discuss this document within the framework of Ecofin. I hope it will do that.
