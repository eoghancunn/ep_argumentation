        "3.Calls for an information session on – at least – an annual basis between the EIB and Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control regarding the execution of the European Development Fund (EDF) investment facility, in parallel with the EDF discharge procedure;\n",
        "4.Invites the EIB to make every effort to retain the AAA rating which safeguards the bank’s activities and the best rates for its loans, and to adapt its prudential policy with this in mind without, however, neglecting very long-term investment;\n",
        "5.Emphasises that the EIB pursues a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy towards fraud and corruption, and welcomes the rise in the number of investigations and the increased cooperation with OLAF; also calls on the EIB to adopt an Anti-fraud Policy and Procedures which include measures leading to: i) an administrative debarment mechanism for companies found guilty of corruption by the Bank and other Multilateral Development Banks; ii) a whistleblower protection policy, and iii) a review of the existing procurement guidelines;\n",
        "6.Welcomes the existence of a complaints office to receive and deal with external complaints, as well as of an appeals mechanism for complaints received via the European Ombudsman; welcomes and actively supports dialogue between the European Ombudsman and the EIB; calls on the EIB to consequently review its internal grievance mechanism and issue new appeal mechanism guidelines extended to all EIB financed operations;\n",
        "7.Welcomes the EIB’s desire for transparency in the framework of its disclosure policy, and the large amount of information that it makes available to the general public, including, annually, the lists of projects funded, with brief information concerning those projects; encourages the EIB to develop the activities of its ‘Operations Evaluation’ department, which carries out anex postevaluation of a representative sample of projects and programmes; Accounting and prudential control mechanisms and result measurement mechanisms\n",
        "8.Notes the favourable opinion of the external audit and the conclusions of the annual report of the Audit Committee; reiterates its desire to see the EIB subject to the same prudential rules as credit establishments and to real prudential control, while at the same time noting that these rules do not apply to comparable international financial institutions;\n",
        "9.Calls for an independent regulatory mission to be established to oversee the quality of the EIB’s financial situation and ensure that its results are accurately measured and the profession’s rules of good conduct observed;\n",
        "10.Suggests that the EIB apply to the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) for an opinion on this supervisory mission, which should state who could carry it out pending the establishment of an official European banking regulator; suggests that every possible scenario should be envisaged, including, for example, involvement of the CEBS, of a national regulator or of a number of national regulators on an annually rotating basis;\n",
        "11.Congratulates the EIB on its efforts in introducing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) into its consolidated financial statements, as well as into those of the European Investment Fund (EIF), for which 2006 was the first financial year in which the IFRS accounting standards were applied;\n",
        "12.Shares, on condition that full information is given to third parties, the EIB’s reservations about applying IFRS accounting standards too hastily to the statutory accounts, before broad consensus has emerged in the Member States regarding, for example, fair value accounting, which could introduce a large element of volatility into the determination of the EIB’s unconsolidated financial results;\n",
        "13.Recommends, nevertheless, that a technical watch be kept on this issue, which will become crucial in terms of presentation, approval and use of accounting results with the development of venture capital operations, financing of SMEs and the financial engineering that the European Union will have to put in place to finance its infrastructure;\n",
        "14.Notes the methodological choices adopted by the EIB to assess credit risks with a view to offsetting the disadvantages arising from lack of experience of losses on credits, while drawing attention to the need to introduce preventive measures to minimise the risks as regards maximum safeguarding of financial resources with a view to ensuring implementation of the goals of European policy;\n",
        "15.Notes the efforts made to overcome these difficulties on the basis of techniques for transposing internal and external parameters, and wishes to receive information about the new methods introduced to rate EIB clients and evaluate credit risks; notes, with reference to securitisation operations, that the simplified approach adopted at present could be reviewed at a future time;\n",
        "16.Hopes, with regard to the application of Basel II, that the EIB can show its ability to carry out its mission with its own funds – EUR 33,5 billion – and to maintain the best rating – AAA;\n",
        "17.Welcomes the approach of the new strategy for 2007-2009, including the reinforcement of value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, inter alia in activities for the benefit of SMEs and local government, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission; unreservedly supports the Bank’s programme of activities for 2007‑2009; New strategic priorities and instruments\n",
        "18.Welcomes the inclusion of promoting reliable, competitive and sustainable energy in the main features of the Bank’s programme of activities, including alternative and renewable energy sources and calls for the development of environmentally friendly funding criteria, in line with the European Union's strategic goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions;\n",
        "19.Welcomes the fact that sustainable development remains a fundamental requirement for the EIB; congratulates the EIB on its excellent results in terms of loan activity for environmental protection and social and economic cohesion; encourages the EIB to reinforce its environmental and social policies, to further improve and update its current standards, in particular concerning its external lending  activities and to ensure the coherence of these activities, more specifically on the African continent, with the European Consensus on Development[11]and the achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals ; asks the EIB to ensure that it engages actively with civil society, inter alia via consultation procedures;\n",
        "20.Congratulates the EIB on the framework contracts signed by the Bank and the Commission: the RSFF and the LGTT; encourages the Commission and the EIB to develop more joint instruments in support of European Union policies, while making efforts to mobilise more private capital to fully ensure implementation of the EIB priority goals; Financing major infrastructure projects\n",
        "21.Recalls that the EIB must avoid all competition with the private sector, even though acting complementarily with it, in seeking an optimal leverage effect for financing European projects;\n",
        "22.Reiterates its encouragement to the EIB to give priority to funding Trans-European Networks (TENs), including cross-border infrastructure that enables national networks to be interconnected, which is an essential element in developing a market economy centred upon social cohesion; calls on the EIB, with regard to the funding of TENs, to give priority to infrastructure or transport projects with a lower or negative carbon footprint;\n",
        "23.Suggests that, given the quality of the EIB’s human resources, its detachment and its experience of financing major infrastructure, the Commission should give it the task of carrying out a strategic reflection on the funding of infrastructure, taking into account the need for balanced regional development and excluding no possible scenarios: subsidies, payment of sums subscribed by the Member States to the EIB’s capital, loans (including EIB loans, for example those financed by special loans from the Member States1), innovative instruments such as the RSFF and the LGTT, financial engineering appropriate to long-term projects that are not immediately profitable, development of guarantee systems, creation of an investment section within the European Union budget, financial consortia between European, national and local authorities, public-private partnerships etc.; Help for SMEs\n",
        "24.Calls on the EIB to ensure that enough venture capital is made available to SMEs which experience difficulty in attracting venture capital; welcomes the launch of the JEREMIE joint initiative (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) developed in 2005 by the Commission’s Regional Policy Directorate-General and the EIB to give businesses better access to financial engineering mechanisms, and encourages the development of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) in the framework of the Lisbon Agenda priorities;\n",

        "26.Confirms the need to provide a better response to the shortcomings in the market for financing SMEs and encourages the Commission, the EIB and the EIF to continue with the diversification of Community financial instruments upstream (technology transfer) and downstream (mezzanine capital) of venture capital, and to promote the development of micro-credit in Europe in the framework of the new European initiative for the development of micro-credit in support of growth and employment (COM(2007)0708); Help with setting up projects\n",
        "27.Emphasises the role of the EIB’s expertise in setting up projects, thanks inter alia to the JASPERS programme (Joint Assistance for Preparing Projects in European Regions); recalls that an important added value of the EIB lies in its engineering capacity in setting up financing for projects and public-private partnerships, not least in the framework of the EPEC (European Public-Private Partnership Expertise Centre), and calls on the EIB to communicate better with project leaders at local level on the technical help it can provide;\n",
        "28.Congratulates the EIB on the opening of new offices in the Member States, which will give the EIB better visibility and greater proximity to project leaders with a view to facilitating projects and will assist the EIB in forging closer links with organisations, institutions, and local authorities as regards the favourable development of the policy of the European Union of balanced regional development as well as the accelerated involvement of the countries that have joined the European Union since 2004; Operations outside the European Union\n",

        "32.Encourages the EIB to pursue its policy of diversified emissions in different world currencies, including the currencies of the emerging countries, while always continuing to cover itself against exchange risks; ° °           °\n",
