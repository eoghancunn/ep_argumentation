In a famous speech, he started by talking about the local impact on a small community in the south of Ireland that used European legislation to maintain its telephone service. Then he moved on to the global – or European – level, speaking about European values and issues such as Blue Flag beaches, the European health card and other benefits that accrue to European citizens. That is a good strategy – communicating the added value of Europe at the local, regional, European and global levels.\nLook at this week and take two pieces of legislation we have passed. We passed an amendment to Aarhus, which already guarantees public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. We have added GMOs to that. That will make a difference at individual local level, where citizens can influence outcomes. We also passed the Services Directive. That too will have a positive impact on our citizens.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur.\nIn the short time available to me, I should like to mention the strategy used by a former President of this Parliament, Pat Cox, to communicate Europe.
