We should be examining the way we communicate with our citizens, and that means we have to be absolutely clear about the language that we use. It must be plain, simple, clear and precise. It is no use talking about tools and barometers. People switch off. We need to be passionate about what we do and how we do it.\nThis is arguably the most successful European institution, and yet we are criticised and we very rarely defend ourselves. There are 25 Member States with different political persuasions and cultures, acting together for the common benefit of 450 million citizens – absolutely brilliant! But do we sell and promote what we do effectively? We do not. Do we ensure that national parliaments engage in their scrutiny role? No, we do not. We merely stand back and take the criticism.\nFinally, let me grab four seconds. I urge the Commission to go forward with its proposal for the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. It is not in this report. It is accepted in the Commission work programme.
