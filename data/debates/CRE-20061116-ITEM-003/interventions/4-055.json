{"speaker": "Margot Wallström,", "english": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, I have to admit that this discussion has left me a bit puzzled. In the White Paper on a new communication policy, we have tried, first of all, to analyse the problem with previous communication policies and see exactly what we have to do to ensure that we democratically safeguard citizens’ rights to information and ensure they have a say in decision-making in Europe.\nWe established five areas of action. We need to define common principles, such as freedom of expression, diversity, inclusion, participation. We need to empower citizens. We need to involve them in different ways, from civic education, giving them a basic knowledge of what goes on, to engaging with civil society. We cannot ignore the new media and new technologies. If we think that it is enough to publish an article in The Financial Times to communicate with citizens, I am sorry, this is 2006. The debate is also shaped elsewhere.\nThe real divide, as someone said at one of our stakeholder conferences, is between the decision-makers and those who use the internet.\nIf you look at the campaign in France, most of the websites on the Constitution were ‘no’ websites. Where were those who wanted to argue for a ‘yes’ vote? They did not use the internet enough. We have to understand and embrace what is going on in the new technologies.\nThe fourth chapter is understanding public opinion. We have to be more professional in monitoring and linking up to public opinion. As many of you have said, we have to do the job together. All the institutions have to take responsibility.\nIn this debate, some have accused us of issuing propaganda as soon as we do anything and others seem to think that it is enough to increase the number of Europe Direct information points in Europe. That will not do. We have to have a serious communication policy as a tool for democracy, a tool for citizens. They have a right to better understanding. They have a right to participate in a public sphere where we have a truly European political culture and truly pan-European media, reflecting the debate that is going on and helping us to understand and follow it. We also need to establish meeting places for citizens where they can participate.\nYou say we already have democracy in Europe. Well, we have a participatory deficit. The majority of citizens still say they know very little or do not know enough about the European Union and its institutions, they are not able to follow what is being done in the European Parliament or the Commission. Can we simply say that we do not care and continue with business as usual? We have to change the way we communicate with citizens and it is their right to engage with us.\nWe will continue to work on all the things that you have mentioned. We have steadily increased the Europe Direct centres. We now have 400 and for the first time we have established them in the UK as well. We will increase this number next year, with 30 new centres, and we will continue our obligation to inform citizens, but that is still not enough. This is not just about information, it is about communication. We have to make it a two-way process.\nMost of our citizens get most of their information from radio and television, so we have to make sure that we help radio and television at all levels to report to citizens on what goes on. That is also part of our policy.\nWe will review Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, because access to information is absolutely crucial. Transparency, openness and access to information are central to a new communication policy.\nOf course we discuss the content of policies: that is at the core of everything we do. A communication policy cannot replace good content or good policymaking. That is why we engage in Plan D activities, where we invite citizens to participate in the political debate about the future of Europe.\nWe take seriously the proposals for practical measures such as Agora, which are extremely important.\nWe have analysed the problems with the lack of a real communication policy. We have identified the five areas of action. We want a serious reaction from the European Parliament. Are these the right areas? If you have other proposals, we would be more than happy to work out very practical ideas, so that we can come back to ask for the necessary budgetary resources. We will combine that with reforming the way we work internally, in order to become more professional, more open, more transparent and more democratic.\nI thank you for this debate and I hope that we shall continue to discuss these very important principles in trying to establish a communication policy that is right for the European Union and all its institutions.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission .
