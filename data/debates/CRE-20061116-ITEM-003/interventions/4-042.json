{"speaker": "Thomas Wise,", "english": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, the EU communication policy that this report evaluates was devised in an attempt to – and I quote – ‘halt the rise of euroscepticism’. It is yet another reaction to the French and Dutch public rejecting unequivocally both the draft Constitutional Treaty and further integration.\nInstead of accepting that ‘no’ means ‘no’, the political elite have deluded themselves that the French and Dutch people did not base their ‘no’ votes on sensible and educated grounds. Indeed, a Commission official is recently quoted as saying: ‘given the recent experience in France and the Netherlands concerning referendums, we would not advise anyone to organise one’. So asking people what they want is a no-no.\nMay I offer you some advice? You are in a hole of your own making. I suggest you stop digging. You should throw away the spade. Why? Very simply, because you are missing the point. It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project, because if the substance is rotten then it will fail. For communication to be successful you have to listen. Simply shouting louder will not do!\nThe institutions are being disingenuous to the people they purport to represent. The French and Dutch have scuppered the project, yet you go on as if this never happened. Let me assure you that if and when the British people are afforded the same opportunity, the results will be even more conclusive, and that no communication policy will change the growing realisation that, right across the Member States, the EU project is an expensive failure.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, the EU communication policy that this report evaluates was devised in an attempt to – and I quote – ‘halt the rise of euroscepticism’.
