    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Stresses the opportunities that an internal market with nearly 500 million people connected to broadband would bring about, creating a globally unique critical mass of users exposing all regions to new opportunities and giving each user increased value and Europe the capacity to be a world leading knowledge-based economy;\n",
        "2.  Agrees that the deployment of broadband networks offering reliable transmission at competitive bandwidth is crucial for business growth, societal development and the enhancement of public services;\n",
        "3.  Emphasises that the magnitude of broadband development cannot be foreseen or planned, but can be stimulated and supported by a creative and open environment;\n",
        "4.  Emphasises that a broader deployment of broadband would revitalise the internal market in general, exposing all regions to new opportunities whilst providing each user with a valuable service and providing Europe with the capacity to become a world leading knowledge-based economy;\n",
        "5.  Stresses that broadband deployment in rural areas is a key factor in the participation of all in the knowledge society; points out, in addition, that broadband services are equally decisive for the economic development of the regions in question and should therefore be deployed as widely as possible;6.  Calls on the Member States to promote broadband connections in every school, university and educational centre in the EUand the introduction of distance learning,, with a view to a future where no European child and no individual involved in educational programmes is left off line in Europe;\n",
        "7.  Notes that in bridging the digital divide, a basic structure, such as the availability of computers in households and in public institutions, must be promoted;\n",
        "8.  Encourages the Member States to produce broadband infrastructure mapping in order to more accurately indicate the coverage of broadband service;\n",
        "9.  Takes the view that the key to closing the broadband gap is innovative technology, i.e. technology which makes it possible to construct high-capacity broadband connections, and points to the fact that new technology has allowed disadvantaged regions to leapfrog many phases of development;\n",
        "10. Points out that developing the competitive advantages and solving the serious problemsof rural, sparsely-populated and inaccessible (island, mountain and other) areas depends on innovative new uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs);\n",
        "11. Emphasises that new technology is by nature more far-reaching and inclusive, thereby making more advanced services possible; stresses also that broadband services will help regions, in particular the least-developed regions, to attract businesses, facilitate distance working, offer new medical diagnostic and care services, and achieve improved educational standards and public services;\n",
        "12. Considers that new technology offers interesting and cheaper solutions for remote, inaccessible (island, mountain, etc.) andrural areas, as wireless links, mobile and satellite communications may deliver broadband to areas traditionally excluded by fixed-line networks; notes that these new technologies must be taken into account when radio spectrum is allocated;\n",
        "13. Stresses that the development of innovative technologies is to be encouraged at all levels, and that a serious effort is needed to promote access to the market and to maintain fair competition therein;\n",
        "14. Considers it important to mobilise ICT research and ICT partnerships between universities, local authorities and business;\n",
        "15.  Encourages the Commission to consider broadband and especially mobile broadband solutions as important within the working programmes of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) and the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technology development and demonstration activities (FP7);\n",
        "16. Urges the Commission to actively seek substantial synergies between its own sectoral programmes, e.g. FP7 and the CIP, including also better coordination with international programmes and the funding provided through the structural and rural development funds for the development of broadband;\n",
        "17. Stresses that broadband connection, given the spectacularly rapid development of the new media, offers the only technically reliable access to media products such as Internet TV and Internet telephony, and will thus prevent people in rural areas from being cut of from society in the cities where broadband is available;\n",
        "18. Recognises that some people have access only to low speed and low capacity broadband; believes that these connections should not be a proxy or substitute for newer high speed connections; insists that no geographic area or socioeconomic group should be denied investment in new, faster technology simply because they already have access to a lower quality connection;\n",
        "19. Notes that new wireless platforms are well suited to ensuring broadband access in rural areas; underlines the importance of technology-neutrality in spectrum allocation; recalls that the Commission has envisaged a more active spectrum policy, and that this has also been supported by Parliament in its resolution of 14 February 2007 ‘Towards a European policy on the radio spectrum’[7];\n",
        "20. Calls on the Community institutions and Member States to cooperate more closely in the management of radio spectrum with a view to facilitating the use of spectrum by a wide range of wireless and mobile technologies (terrestrial and satellite);\n",
        "21. Urges the Member States to allocate sufficient spectrum to broadband technologies;\n",
        "22. Emphasises that digital literacy is an indispensable basis for the exploitation of the opportunities broadband offers and points to the responsibility in this regard of public education; emphasises also the need to improve access to ICTs for as many European citizens as possible and to improve their ICT skills;\n",
        "23. Calls for consumer-oriented measures in the field of further education and the mobilisation of technical resources in the information technology sector; advocates financial and tax incentives for such measures;\n",
        "24. Takes the view that investment in e-health, e-government and e-learning applications can play an important role in driving consumer demand for broadband, and thus create the critical mass necessary for large markets to emerge in these areas;\n",
        "25. Believes that the promotion by public authorities in cooperation with business of broadband-enhanced applications and services can contribute to the efficient delivery of government services and, at the same time, provide incentives for the procurement of broadband access, which will help to stimulate supply;\n",
        "26. Highlights the scope for public authorities to exploit pre-commercial procurement to stimulate innovative service delivery across broadband networks; notes that they can also co-ordinate demand across communities and service providers to ensure the critical mass needed to underpin new network investments; encourages the Commission to promote awareness and use of these tools;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission and Member States to give preference to broadband Internet solutions and technologies in the computerisation of government departments, the education sector and small and medium-size enterprises (e.g. application service providers, terminal servers);\n",
        "28. States that a core set of European e-services can serve to further integration and strengthen cohesion as well as create a single European electronic market via the use of broadband, and calls for this area to be made a special priority for the use of structural and rural funds;furthermore, emphasises the role that such development funds play in supporting regions in this regard;\n",
        "29. Calls on the EU and Member States to deliver on the 2003 Barcelona European Council objective of ensuring that European citizens are offered relevant public broadband services;\n",
        "30. Believes that it is extremely important for people to be ensured the widest possible access to high-quality content and services wherever they are using the technology of their choice and emphasises the need for access networks and for networks open to different operators;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Community institutions and the Member States to promote the availability of content on line, notably by addressing its appropriate protection in a digital environment;\n",
        "32. Asserts that the rapid deployment of broadband is crucial for the development of European productivity and competitivityand for the emergence of new and small enterprises that can be leaders in different sectors, for example health care, manufacturing and financial services;\n",
        "33. Takes the view that private investment is essential for wider broadband deployment and universal coverage; stresses that private investors should be given the opportunity of refinancing their investments if the competitive dynamic is to be further stimulated and if better services and more innovation and choice are to be delivered to consumers;\n",
        "34. Stresses the importance of industry-driven, open, interoperable standards at a technical, legal and semantic level so as to enable economies of scale, ensure non-discriminatory open access to the information society and promote the fast deployment of technologies;\n",
        "35. Urges the Community institutions and Member States to work with industry and address problems (such as micro-payments, security and trust, interoperability and Digital Rights Management) that hamper the development of new business models in the field of broadband;\n",
        "36. Emphasises that the role of the EU is to create a supportive environment for the development of innovation and for the introduction of new technologies by providing a regulatory framework that invites competition and private investment and by the use of relevant funds to drive demand for broadband services and, where justified,to supportthe necessary infrastructure,\n",
        "37. Notes that public authorities have an important role to play in stimulating broadband network roll-out, and that they should consider measures to encourage demand, and investment in fixed infrastructure; calls for a clear framework for infrastructure investment that should not distort markets nor be operated on unfair terms when compared to private enterprises;  commends the Commission for having clarified the State aid rules as regards participation by public authorities in broadband development programmes;\n",
        "38. Emphasises that the main role of Member States regarding broadband promotion is the creation of an environment in which there is legal certainty, which encourages competition and which stimulates investment and that, in order to achieve this, the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications must be effectively implemented ;reiterates the importance of ensuring competitive market conditions and the need for all Member States to transpose and implement the regulatory framework for electronic communications, and to ensure that they have effective, independent and properly resourced regulators;\n",
        "39. Highlights the key role played by the market in the expansion and development of innovative services; stresses,however,that it is imperative thatnationalregulators, competition authorities and national and localgovernmentssimultaneously give prioritytopromotingmore vigorouscompetition and investment in broadband markets as well asto applying remedies to address abuses of dominant positions andcartels, and finally toreducing barriers to entry, so that the market is able to deliver innovation;\n",
        "40. Notes the growing competition in the European broadband market; recalls that the sectoral regulation of the ICT industry was planned from the outset as a transitional solution for the opening of the markets, and that it must in the medium term come to be governed by the general rules of competition alone;\n",
        "41. Emphasises that the forthcoming review of the regulatory framework must be aimed at ensuring open access and fair competition for all operators;\n",
        "42. Takes the view that, with a view to achieving more rapid broadband deployment in rural areas, no restrictions should be imposed on the joint use of networks on a voluntary basis by infrastructure managers; stresses that such agreements between infrastructure managers are an effective means of achieving wider broadband deployment in regions lacking the necessary broadband transmission of infrastructures and where future demand would not sustain several networks;\n",
        "43. Emphasises the need to construct broadband infrastructure at local community level in accordance with the public-private partnership principle and taking account of equal access;\n",
        "44. Stresses that competition and effective and appropriate rules for opening up the broadband market provide the greatest stimulus for broadband deployment, meaning roll-out, speed and a variety of services;\n",
        "45. Emphasises the need for technological neutrality combined with the avoidance of fragmentation and consideration of technological trends and user needs, something which will challenge European regulators to open up new solutions and yet create stable preconditions at the same time;\n",
        "46.Emphasises that the functional unbundling of access networks of market incumbents from their operating activities may have positive advantages and could ensure the equal and fair treatment of all operators;\n",
        "47. Calls on the Commission, in its forthcoming green paper on universal service, to examine the availability of Internet services at reasonable and affordable rates throughout the EU to all citizens, including those on a low income, rural and high-cost areas, and whether there is a need to modify the existing universal service requirements; also expects the green paper to address consumer concerns regarding secure and safe broadband use;\n",
        "48. Stresses that public funding should only be used where the roll-out of broadband infrastructure is not economically viable for private undertakings and should not serve to duplicate existing infrastructure capable of providing broadband services;\n",
        "49. Emphasises that national and Community public funding should be competitively neutral and contribute to commercially sustainable investments; stresses that public procurement contracts should be awarded by open, transparent, competitive and non-discriminatory tendering;\n",
        "50.Stresses that publicly fundedinfrastructure should be provided on an equal access basis,and should not favourparticular service providers;\n",
        "51. Takes the view that, in addition to market forces, Member States and in particular their regions and municipalities, could set incentives to stimulate the broadband market in disadvantaged regions; emphasises the role that structural and rural development funds should play in supporting regions strengthening the demand side of the information society;\n",
        "52. States that publicly funded investments in broadband infrastructure must be possible within the framework of EU competition rules;\n",
        "53. Urges the Commission to ensure that equal access to broadband networks financed with support from the structural and rural funds is given to all service providers; believes furthermore that in order to ensure compliance with the requirements, national regulatory authorities should be granted the power to impose openness requirements in regulations and be given a mandate to enforce those requirements;\n",
        "54. Emphasises the importance of combining regional development with a European broadband policy, including the use of regional and rural funds, for the development of mobile broadband solutions or the setting up of necessary infrastructure;\n",
        "55. Calls on the Commission to further develop and review guidelines on how to use structural and rural funds to promote broadband deployment and uptake and, in particular, to provide more precise guidance regarding the utilisation of structural funds for the deployment of broadband services where a partial supply of such services already exists;\n",
        "56. Calls on the Commission to provide guidance and disseminate good practice on the observance of State aid rules regarding public financial support given to broadband projects;\n",
        "57. Calls on the Commission to allow EU funds also to be used for upgrading or replacing broadband networks which do not provide connections with suitable functional capacity;\n",
        "58. Urges the Commission to provide adequate information and statistics and to assess the impact of structural and rural funding on broadband deployment in assisted regions and promote the exchange of best practices between the regions of the EU;\n",
        "59. Encourages the Commission to closely examine whether the regulatory framework is fully implemented and whether the rules on State aid are applied whenever structural and rural funds are to be used for broadband investments and to ensure that EU fundingis used to improve the penetration rate of ICTs throughout the EU, without favouring specific players or technological options, but only the most efficient solutions; notes further that such use of EU funds should be permitted only in under-served areas and where it is clear that there are no other sources of investment in broadband infrastructure; stresses that all decisions should be transparent and published on national and European websites linked to the competition authorities;\n",
        "60. Considers that public intervention in the forms of loans and grants, often implemented through public-private partnerships, should be further developed in under-served areas;\n",
        "61. Insists, furthermore, that public support to broadband infrastructure must adhere to the principle of ‘technology neutrality’, not favouring a priori any particular technology, nor limiting the technological choices of the regions while at the same time preventing fragmentation of the technical infrastructure, taking into account development trends and the future needs of users and promoting the construction of higher-capacity broadband connections; o o   o\n",
        "62. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
