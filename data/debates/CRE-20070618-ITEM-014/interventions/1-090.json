{"speaker": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE),", "english": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . – Mr President, I must apologise to the rapporteur and the Commissioner for missing my slot earlier, but I was viewing another form of European technology at the Paris Air Show and came here as quickly as possible.\nOn behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating almost all elements of our opinion, including some of our suggestions, into his report. His report is to be commended, because it takes a very broad view of the issue.\nThe report quite rightly emphasises that the provision of broadband is an extremely dynamic and evolving market. Many comments have already been made in the debate about the importance of spreading broadband, particularly into rural areas, where it is more difficult to provide services. However, the new wireless and satellite technologies are opening up those markets at a far lower cost than ever before, which is important.\nI would caution colleagues who have been calling for local authority or state support for infrastructure. Frankly, the problem is that if you invest in infrastructure it will soon be out of date and it is not characteristic of state enterprises to sustain investment, or even to sustain consistent policy. We do not want to crowd out the private providers of competing technologies. Where there is a market failure, it would be far better, as our opinion states, for authorities to act as the lead customer and to aggregate demand, e.g. from their education and social services, and offer those launch contracts to private providers, ensuring that competition is kept in place.\nI know the Commissioner is extremely keen on this approach to broadband provision. We fully support her desire to sustain competition as the main medium of delivery.\nIn conclusion, I want to pick up on an earlier comment by my friend Erika Mann: as the lead committee for universal service end-users’ rights – and having dealt with that directive before – we await the Commission’s Green Paper on this subject with great interest. Our opinion and the Hökmark report indicate some directions we wish the Commissioner to look at. It is quite clear that the issue of universal service needs to be looked at, but we should be very cautious about applying a new rigid formula given the dynamic state of the market and the fact that broadband demand will continue to increase.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . – Mr President, I must apologise to the rapporteur and the Commissioner for missing my slot earlier, but I was viewing another form of European technology at the Paris Air Show and came here as quickly as possible.\nOn behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating almost all elements of our opinion, including some of our suggestions, into his report.
