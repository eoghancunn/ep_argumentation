I am not going to dwell on the report and emphasise how important the further expansion of broadband connections is for the economic development of the European Union and its Member States. I would primarily like to highlight a problem concerning access to these networks in rural, remote or less densely populated areas.\nThis problem is apparent in most of the new Member States. Underdeveloped regions, in particular, need much more attention than has been accorded them so far by the European Union and, particularly, by national governments. The challenge is to encourage and motivate broadband operators to invest more into these regions. In my opinion, national, regional and local authorities should come up with new systemic incentives, including tax measures or easier access to public funding by means of public-private projects, primarily focusing on building up the technical infrastructure for broadband networks in such areas.\nPublic funds invested under such schemes will be recouped very rapidly, as business is promoted through the knowledge economy and public services are provided more efficiently, for example, by means of e -government, e -health, e -learning or e -procurement. On the other hand, I would like to call on the European Commission to seriously consider these aspects when formulating European policy on broadband connectivity and conceiving a regulatory framework.\nParadoxically, too tight a regulatory policy in an area so important in terms of boosting European economic competitiveness could cause a slowdown in economic development as well as larger disparities between regions. I, for one, believe that at this stage of developing broadband connections the potential implementation of unbundling may play a rather negative role by decreasing the rate of private investment into less developed regions.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Hudacký (PPE-DE). – ( SK ) First of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, for a very good and balanced report.
