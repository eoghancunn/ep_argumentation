{"speaker": "Giles Chichester (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Giles Chichester (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I am very impressed to see the Commissioners for Competition and Information Technology job-sharing this evening.\nIn the headlong rush to universal provision of broadband access to the internet, let us remember the impact of this technology on older people and less mobile people. It can be a great benefit, but it can also be a great challenge. We must remember that there are those people who may not be able, or who may not wish, to use the internet.\nI suggest that achieving our dynamic knowledge-based economy is not so much about access to knowledge as what we do with it. I cannot help wondering whether we are not at risk of turning our citizens into couch potatoes, sitting in front of their computer screens and having to resort to virtual exercise rather than the real thing.\nI note a recent report in the press that there has been a marked slow-down of internet shopping in the United States because – surprise – people still want to go to the shop and see the product for themselves and touch it, and not just see it virtually.\nFurthermore, I would guess that we all agree that broadband is a good thing – we are all in favour of it – but I ask myself whether we really need 62 paragraphs to say so.\nFinally, when I was listening to my esteemed colleague, Mr Rübig, a moment ago, I thought I was in a time warp addressing a rather different issue, but then I realised he had just ‘roamed’ off the subject.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Giles Chichester (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I am very impressed to see the Commissioners for Competition and Information Technology job-sharing this evening.\nIn the headlong rush to universal provision of broadband access to the internet, let us remember the impact of this technology on older people and less mobile people.
