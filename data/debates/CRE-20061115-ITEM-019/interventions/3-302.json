{"speaker": "Diana Wallis,", "english": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to welcome the Green Paper, and thank Mr Gargani very much for his report and all the work that has been done on it in terms of consultation. It really is welcome.\nThis is clearly an issue that affects an increasing number of our citizens and that we have to address, but it is not a simple issue. When one thinks about how terrible it is for any individual to have to deal with bereavement and then adds to that the difficulties of dealing with some sort of transnational legal situation, it is clearly an area that we have to try to tackle in order to make life easier for our citizens, having encouraged them to be mobile in the way that we have.\nBut the legal problems that this raises touch on subsidiarity. They touch the culture of our different legal systems very deeply. But it is clear that if we are to tackle the problem, we need, as Mr Gargani has said – and I think my group would also underline – to move towards a binding European certificate of inheritance. That has to be our first goal, to have free circulation of such a binding certificate, in the same way as we have free circulation of ordinary judgments. It is going to be difficult though because, as I have said, it touches matters of public policy within our various countries. It touches matters of taxation law. But I commend the report and hope that the Commissioner will be able to take it forward to a legislative instrument.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to welcome the Green Paper, and thank Mr Gargani very much for his report and all the work that has been done on it in terms of consultation.
