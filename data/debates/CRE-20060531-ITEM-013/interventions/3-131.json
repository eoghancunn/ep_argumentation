{"speaker": "Peter Mandelson,", "english": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I would like to add my thanks to the rapporteurs for two excellent reports and simply to make two points.\nThe first is that for all the attention that is occasionally given to disagreements in trade matters between the United States and the European Union, it is worth bearing in mind that 98% of our trade is dispute-free. Where there are disputes, both sides move rapidly, not always with immediate success, but rapidly to resolve these amicably and quickly. That is something we should note and celebrate without being complacent.\nThe second point I want to make is that Erika Mann’s report does not actually call for a single free trade area, so those who are opposing it are aiming at the wrong target. What the report calls for is a barrier-free area, a barrier-free transatlantic market between Europe and the United States. That is something that we can applaud and encourage. As I said earlier on, I do not think it will attract the support of some sort of ‘big-bang’ elaborate scheme. However, the fact is that this trade and investment relationship between us is worth a colossal amount in terms of people’s jobs, their livelihoods, their futures. It is not so much tariffs, anymore, that stand in the way of growth in this relationship; it is non-tariff barriers, regulatory barriers, differences in standards and licensing and all the rest. There is a sort of bonfire of barriers to set alight. These are very noble and correct economic objectives for us to set our hands and our shoulders to. This is why I so heartily commend this report and will dedicate myself and my services to realising its spirit.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission .
