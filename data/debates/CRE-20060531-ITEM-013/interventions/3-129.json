{"speaker": "Ursula Plassnik,", "english": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel strengthened in my intention to address a range of issues at the approaching summit, issues that concern our common future including cooperation in order to promote democracy, human rights, freedom and prosperity, but also issues relating to the global challenges we face: climate change, the fight against terrorism, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and also the issue of energy security, which is increasingly occupying us on both sides of the Atlantic and which has been the subject of intensive work in the Council in this half-year period; I have already referred to the air traffic agreement in my introduction. Regarding international questions it has been pointed out that in recent months progress has been achieved on a range of issues. Here we need to advance slowly and step by step. I would like to thank the Commission, too, for its close cooperation.\nI would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs and all those who have also worked on this report and those who regularly take part in the debate on our transatlantic relations. These relations are central for the European Union and for us all, and so we must avoid adopting one-sided positions. What is needed, rather, is to discuss existing irritations and all unresolved questions as partners in a dialogue. These points must not, however, overshadow that which binds us together or that which is profound and resistant to strain: the shared community of values and the work on the world issues that are important to us.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ursula Plassnik, President-in-Office of the Council.
