It is a good time to underline how strong this relationship is and to what extent it goes far beyond the current administration and the problems with the specific administration and specific leadership, which some of us will not like. It is something that is deeper than that and it goes far beyond that. It goes beyond the strong political debate we might have. Precisely because the relationship is strong, it allows us to tell the truth to the other party.\nHowever, the relationship lacks a real new structure, a real new architecture. As is mentioned in the reports, we need a new architecture to protect this relationship, to protect it from external storms and to make it much more solid than it is now. This needs commitment from the Commission. We are not seeing this commitment in looking for this new architecture, and I think it is the Commission’s role to develop and to work towards that direction.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ignasi Guardans Cambó (ALDE). – Mr President, both reports, especially Erika Mann’s, show the intensity of the relationship between the European Union and the United States, and, at the same time, highlight the long list of areas in which there might be difficulties and misunderstandings.
