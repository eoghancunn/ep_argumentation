On behalf of the Committee of Industry, I would like to make three very important points.\nFirstly, as the Commissioner mentioned, in the field of energy we need cooperation on efficiency sufficiency and on sustainability.\nSecondly, in relation to research – which is extremely important – our committee is now working with the Seventh Framework Programme. Equally important is the cooperation with the institutions in the US as well as with industry. Much can be done to facilitate more cooperation in this field.\nThirdly, we have discussed the setting-up of a body to improve discussions between industries. We would like to set up something analogous to the very successful Iran-US claims tribunal, which, in a simple and elegant way, resolves thousands of disputes. We would like something similar in the future.\nFinally, I would also like to underline the importance of parliamentary exchanges to begin discussions and to bring success on these three extremely important topics.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Lena Ek (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . – Mr President, Erika Mann’s report is proof not only of her skills as a rapporteur, but also of the underlying strength of transatlantic economic relations.
