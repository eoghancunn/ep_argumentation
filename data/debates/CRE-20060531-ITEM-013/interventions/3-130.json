{"speaker": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner,", "english": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for this excellent debate on a central and essential relationship that will indeed focus on how much further our cooperation can grow on foreign policy and democracy promotion, on increased cooperation in relation to energy, and on the enhancement of growth and competitiveness in our economies. Let me respond to a few question rather briefly.\nIndeed, we plan to sign a new agreement on higher education and vocational training, including launching an innovative transatlantic degree programme.\nAs for tourism – which was also mentioned – exchanges would be facilitated by extending the visa waiver programme to all our Member States.\nAs to the environment, we want to relaunch our dialogue with the US, notably by relaunching the high-level dialogue on the environment, including the issue of climate change. Our cooperation on energy will also touch on climate change issues from the standpoint of energy efficiency. However, our overall dialogue needs to be broader than this.\nFor those who might not have been here at the beginning, I would like to come back to the questions of visa waiver and visa reciprocity. These are issues that we not only mention on a regular basis, but they are there in the dialogue, and will certainly be taken up again with President Bush.\nOn passenger name records and the recent European Court of Justice judgment relating to the cases brought by the European Parliament, we respect the Court’s judgment and analysis and we will fully comply with it. We will cooperate with Parliament, the Council and with the national data protection authorities to ensure that the judgment is fully complied with. We have only four months to find a new legal basis, but I hope we will be able to cooperate in such a way that there will be no lowering of protection standards, no disruption to transatlantic air traffic, and that a high level of security will be maintained.\nFinally, we are looking forward to the successful setting-up of the Galileo satellite navigation system, where cooperation with third countries is necessary and useful, and where we hope that cooperation with the US will bring an additional benefit to our companies and citizens.\nWe are very thankful to the two rapporteurs and for the engagement and commitment of Parliament. It will certainly give us more strength.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission .
