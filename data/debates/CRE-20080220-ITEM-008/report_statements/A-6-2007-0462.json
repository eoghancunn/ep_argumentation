    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Notes that the total number of infringement proceedings initiated by the Commission has constantly increased in the last years and reached 2 709 detected infringements in 2003 (for EU 15); further notes that the number of detected infringements dramatically decreased in 2004 (by 563) and increased again in 2005, albeit to a level which is lower than in 2003: 2 653 registered infringements (for EU 25);\n",
        "2.  Notes accordingly that the accession of 10 new Member States seems not to have had any impact on the number of registered infringements, and calls on the Commission to give Parliament some explanation and reassurance that this is not due to a lack of registration of complaints or/and to a lack of internal resources dealing with infringements within the Commission;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the willingness of most of the relevant Directorates-General to provide information on the resources allocated to infringements in their respective area as well as on the state of infringement proceedings; notes that each Directorate-General has its own way of dealing with the application of Community law and with the allocation of resources and that there is no precise overview and public general evaluation of the way these different approaches work;\n",
        "4.  Commits itself to support the Commission via increased budget appropriations for an increase of resources, as requested by most of the relevant Directorates-General;\n",
        "5.  Welcomes the fact that some Directorates-General have developed specific mechanisms to supplement the use of infringement proceedings with a view to achieving an effective monitoring and consolidation of the application of Community law; notes that, in the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications, the notification procedures in respect of draft national legislative measures were established, permitting collaboration among the national regulatory authorities of the Member States and the Commission within a short time frame; calls on the Commission to consider the systematic application of this preventive mechanism to other sectors;\n",
        "6.  Considers that the sharing of best practices between the Member States, for example in the form of package meetings and transposition workshops organised by the Commission to facilitate the application of Community law, should be encouraged; calls on the Commission to consider means of involving Parliament in such processes;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the efforts made by some Directorates-General of the Commission – and notably DG Environment – to improve the conformity checks on the relevant directives, but is not satisfied with the Commission's answer concerning the confidentiality of the conformity studies; calls once more on the Commission to publish on its website the studies requested by the various Directorates-General on the evaluation of the conformity of national implementation measures with Community legislation;\n",
        "8.   Welcomes the inclusion in the Annual Report and its related annexes for the first time of particulars of the specific and detailed treatment of infringements relating to petitions;\n",
        "9.   Encourages the practice of sending fact-finding missions to various Member States to investigate issues raised by petitioners; regards this as a pragmatic way of solving problems directly with Member States in the interests of the citizen; believes that such missions are all the more necessary in the light of the Commission's lack of “inspection” powers for verifying the practical implementation of EC law, for example in the area of the environment;\n",
        "10. Welcomes the Commission's commitment as a rule to include citizens' or peoples' summaries in future legislative proposals and requests concrete examples of such summaries as well as clarification that they form an integral part of the legal act concerned, as called for in paragraph 19 of Parliament's resolution of 16 May 2006 on the Commission's 21st and 22nd Annual reports on monitoring the application of Community law (2003 and 2004)[1];\n",
        "11. Believes that the Commission should be more proactive in monitoring national events which may disclose a breach of Community law; calls on the Commission, therefore, to make more intensive use of its Representation Offices to prevent or remedy infringements;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Member States to go beyond a purely formal transposition of Community legislation and to avoid, as far as possible, the fragmentary transposition of directives with a view to making legislation simpler and more transparent;\n",
        "13. Welcomes the fact that, in its Communication entitled “A Europe of results – Applying Community law”, the Commission addressed some of the main policy issues raised in Parliament's above-mentioned resolution of 16 May 2006; notices, however, that some important issues are still pending and were not fully answered, notably those concerning the resources allocated to deal with the infringement cases, the length of the infringement procedure and the limited use of Article 228  of the EC Treaty, and the evaluation of the application of the priority criteria; asks the Commission to provide an answer with regard to these important issues;\n",
        "14. Welcomes the fact that, in its recently adopted Communication, the Commission attaches value to, and takes duly into account, the issue of the application of Community law: “if laws are not being properly applied, European policy objectives risk not being attained and the freedoms guaranteed by the Treaties may only be partially realised”[2]; encourages the Commission to achieve concrete and visible results through the following-up of the commitments listed in that Communication and to keep Parliament constantly informed on those results;\n",
        "15. Notes that the examination of petitions has revealed what appear to be structural weaknesses in the implementation by Member States of various norms of Community law; is of the opinion that, in order to ensure the consistency and coherence of Community law, infringements of Community law must be consistently brought before the Court of Justice, at least in nationally important cases which set a precedent for national case-law and future practice; takes the view that consistency on the part of the Commission in this respect could significantly reduce citizens' subsequent need to complain to the Commission and petition the European Parliament on analogous issues;\n",
        "16. Notes that the main obstacle to the effectiveness of the infringement procedure (Articles 226 and 228 of the EC Treaty) remain its length and the limited use of Article 228; insists that the time target proposed by the Commission in respect of the non-communication of transposition measures (no more than 12 months from the sending of the letter of formal notice to the resolution of the case or the Court being seised of the matter) and in respect of proceedings to ensure compliance with an earlier judgment of the Court (between 12 and 24 months) must in no case be exceeded, and, to that end, calls on the Commission to carry out, within that time-limit, periodic monitoring of the progress of infringement procedures and to inform the citizens concerned thereof;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to be more firm in applying Article 228 of the Treaty in order to ensure that judgments of the Court of Justice are properly complied with;\n",
        "18. Welcomes the Commission's intention to improve current working methods with the aim of prioritising and accelerating the handling and management of existing procedures as well as to commit and formally involve the Member States; notes that, under the proposed new working method, enquiries and complaints received by the Commission will be directly transmitted to the Member State concerned “where an issue requires clarification of the factual or legal position in the Member State. (...) The Member State would be given a short deadline to provide the necessary clarifications, information and solutions directly to the citizens or business concerned and inform the Commission”[3];\n",
        "19. Is deeply concerned that, by referring back to the Member State concerned (which is the party responsible for the incorrect application of Community law in the first place), the new working method could present a risk of repudiation by the Commission of its institutional responsibility for ensuring the application of Community law as the “guardian of the Treaty” in accordance with Article 211 of the EC Treaty; observes that the Commission is often the only body left to which citizens can turn to denounce the non-application of Community law;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission, therefore, to clarify the following issues when setting up the new working method:\n",
        "21. Welcomes the Commission's suggestion that a pilot exercise, involving some Member States, be set up to test the new working method in 2008, which could, after evaluation of the first year of operation, be extended to all Member States;\n",
        "22. Asks the Commission to focus the proposed pilot exercise on those Member States in which the application of Community law remains problematic as a result of a lack of cooperation on the part of national authorities, especially at regional and local level; asks the Commission to verify through the pilot exercise if and where more resources are needed within the Commission to handle and manage complaints following the setting-up of the new working method;\n",
        "23. Given that petitions and complaints from citizens and businesses facilitate the detection of a very substantial number of infringements, and in order to avoid confusion in contacting the various problem-solving bodies, urges the Commission to investigate the possibility of clear signposting or the creation of an on-line one-stop-shop in order to assist citizens;\n",
        "24. Welcomes the Commission’s decision to “introduce more frequent decision-taking for most procedural steps to allow for quicker progress”; notes that the Commission organises four formal meetings a year to decide on infringement procedures, and welcomes the Commission’s decision to have more frequent decision-taking on infringements; regrets that the Communication did not define stronger political and organisational measures to tackle these new commitments;\n",
        "25. Notes that the annex to the Communication contains a list of areas of Community law proposed for evaluation, and calls on the Commission to provide an explanation of the scope of that list;\n",
        "26. Regrets that the Commission did not respect its commitment, announced in its 2002 Communication on “Better monitoring of the application of Community law”, that “the application of the priority criteria will be assessed annually, when the report on the monitoring of the application of Community law is discussed”[4]; welcomes its new commitment to “describe and explain its action on these priorities in its annual reports, from 2008”[5];\n",
        "27. Notes that Parliament has continued to receive petitions alleging persistent breaches by Member States of the petitioners' human and fundamental rights and deeply regrets that the criteria for violations of the human rights or fundamental freedoms enshrined in substantive Community law have disappeared from the new list of priority criteria; recalls that the EU Treaty gives Parliament the power to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 7(1) of that Treaty;\n",
        "28. Urges the Commission to extensively apply the principle that all correspondence which is likely to denounce a real violation of Community law should be registered as a complaint, unless it falls within the exceptional circumstances referred to in point 3 of the Annex to the Communication on “Relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law”[6]; notes that the European Ombudsman has recently found the Commission responsible for “maladministration” for not having registered a complaint in accordance with that Communication; urges the Commission to inform and consult Parliament on any changes in the exceptional criteria for the non-registration of complaints;\n",
        "29. Urges all services of the Commission to keep complainants fully informed of the progress of their complaints at the expiry of each pre-defined deadline (letter of formal notice, reasoned opinion, referral to the Court), to provide reasons for their decisions and to communicate those reasons in full detail to the complainant in accordance with the principles stated in its Communication of 2002;\n",
        "30. Welcomes the Commission’s intention to take action to ensure free access to its electronic database and encourages it to act on that commitment as soon as possible;\n",
        "31. Welcomes the Commission's commitment to provide summary information on all stages of infringement proceedings from the letter of formal notice as they progress; considers that, in the interests of transparency and better application of Community law in the national courts, the Commission should make available the content and timing of contacts with Member States once the relevant issues are no longer under investigation;\n",
        "32. Welcomes the Commission's forthcoming publication of an explanatory document on the case-law of the Court of Justice concerning claims for damages for breach of rights under Community law; further suggests that the Commission should investigate the possibility of acting asamicus curiaein relevant damages cases before national courts, in accordance with national procedural law, as is already the case for domestic litigation involving EC competition law issues[7];\n",
        "33. Considers that Parliament’s standing committees should take a much more active role in monitoring the application of Community law in their fields of competenceand, to that end, should receive support and regular information from the Commission; suggests that, wherever possible, Parliament’s rapporteur for a particular file or his/her appointed successor should play a central and continuing role in the ongoing review of Member States’ compliance with Community law; notes that regular sessions on the application of Community law organised by the Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safetyare a practice that should be extended to all Parliament’s committees and that the Commission should be systematically involved;\n",
        "34. Notices, however, that the Commission's reluctance to provide precise information on the issues where infringement proceedings have started greatly reduces public interest in, and the effectiveness of, these sessions; calls on Parliament's committees to envisage, where appropriate, including representatives of the relevant Member States or of the Council in the list of invitees to the sessions on the application of Community law;\n",
        "35. Believes that Parliament's committees (including the Committee on Petitions) should be given sufficient administrative support to carry out their mission effectively; asks the Working Party on parliamentary reform, the Committee on Budgets and other relevant Parliament bodies to submit concrete proposals dealinginter aliawith the aforementioned ongoing role of rapporteurs and to assess the feasibility of a special task force within each committee's secretariat to guarantee the continuing and effective monitoring of the application of Community law;\n",
        "36. Calls for increased cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament and their respective parliamentarians, in order to promote and increase effective scrutiny of European matters at national level; considers that national parliaments have a valuable role to play in monitoring the application of Community law, thus helping to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European Union and bring it closer to the citizens;\n",
        "37. Recalls the commitment on the part of the Council to encourage the Member States to draw up and publish tables illustrating the correlation between directives and domestic transposition measures; insists that such tables are essential to enable the Commission to carry out an effective scrutiny of implementing measures in all Member States; calls on Parliament as co-legislator to take all steps necessary to ensure that provisions regarding those tables are not removed from the text of Commission proposals during the legislative process;\n",
        "38. Notes that national courts play an essential role in applying Community law and fully supports the Commission's efforts to identify supplementary training for national judges, legal practitioners and officials within the national authorities;\n",
        "39. Calls on the Commission to improve monitoring of compliance by Member States’ judicial authorities with Parliament’s decisions on parliamentary immunity and, where the Commission finds a failure to comply with those decisions, to inform Parliament of the action it intends to take; ° °         °\n",
        "40. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Ombudsman and the parliaments of the Member States.\n"
