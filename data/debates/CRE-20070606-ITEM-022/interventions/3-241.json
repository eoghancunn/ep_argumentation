{"speaker": "Vladimír Maňka,", "english": "Vladimír Maňka, on behalf of the PSE Group . – ( SK ) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and express my thanks for the excellent cooperation.\nLast month the Committee on Budgets was addressed by marketing experts, and they agreed that WebTV is an excellent information tool for European Union citizens. The project must therefore be completed as soon as possible. In the committee we agreed that small local media should be more involved in the activities of the European Parliament. This will increase the awareness of European Union citizens about the work of the European Parliament.\nWe differ, however, on how these media should be engaged. One school of thought suggests that funds should be allocated to each Member so that they could invite journalists working for local media to the European Parliament. My political group is not prepared to support this approach to cooperation. Therefore, on behalf of MEPs for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we are submitting an amendment proposing to adopt clear rules of the game governing communication with local and regional media. The idea is, on the one hand, to bring over to Brussels and Strasbourg as many local journalists as possible; and, on the other, to ensure that our procedures are clear and transparent.\nColleagues, you all undoubtedly wish for your work to be efficient. You want to be in a position to demonstrate to your voters that you use the available funds as efficiently as possible. However, it is frequently the case that crucial documents which Members receive for committee deliberations are only available in one or two languages. If, as a result, another extraordinary meeting of the committee needs to be convened, this negatively impacts the entire process and is inefficient.
