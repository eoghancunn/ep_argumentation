        "11. Calls on the Member States to bear in mind that financial incentive strategies must involve coordination between central and local authorities and other local bodies and institutions (not forgetting that much of the listed heritage is religious in nature) while seeking to protect and improve the natural and cultural environment of the localities concerned;\n",

        "19.  Calls on the Commission, principally within the framework of the Culture (2007-2013) programme to give partner networks in the various Member States the opportunity of implementing multiannual projects to promote fully restored traditional communities, with a population of say, less than 1000;\n",
        "20.      Considers that such measures will make it possible to organise cultural activities seeking to develop the cultural heritage of these communities with the more long-term aim of strengthening cooperation between traditional communities in Europe and enabling them to develop their specifically local cultures together with their European dimension;\n",

        "23.      Welcomes the recent proposal within the framework of the Council for the compilation of a European cultural heritage list and calls on the Commission to support it; takes the view that in this context, particular importance should be given to the local cultural heritage of rural and island areas, taking account also of the intangible aspects of the cultural heritage; takes the view that candidate countries must also be invited to participate in this initiative;\n",

        "26.      Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Council of Europe. The European Union will have achieved a common European identity when its citizens are convinced that they share the same culture. It is therefore essential for European Union policies to give priority to recognition of the common natural and architectural cultural heritage and its consequences for future generations as part of a shared history and a source of inspiration for the future. The conservation and promotion of the cultural heritage must be considered as integral to the European Union's overall objectives as set out in Article 2 of the EC Treaty. The European Union must also adopt a comprehensive approach to the cultural heritage so that provisions to uphold it are included in all policy areas. The Article 151(4) of the EC Treaty states 'that the Community shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of this Treaty in particular in order to respect and promote the diversity of its cultures. Thiseffectively means that culture must be considered across the board in connection with all European Union policies. This is particularly important with regard to the cultural heritage which, by its very nature, must be taken into account with regard to agricultural, regional, environmental, research, education and other European Union policies. This horizontal clause of the Treaty is the key to effective action by the EU institutions to protect and conserve the cultural heritage. When the Commission draws up legislative proposals its Directorate-General for Education and Culture must accordingly give greater consideration to their impact on culture and the cultural heritage so that the horizontal dimension of culture is put into practice in a more correct way in all European Union policies. The report seeks to stress the specific nature and the importance of the European natural and architectural cultural heritage, in view of the numerous benefits to be derived in social, environmental, and economic terms and for European integration. More specifically, the report seeks to pinpoint the challenges arising in connection with this lesser-known aspect of the cultural heritage, that is to say European cultural heritage of rural and island areas, which require greater protection, giving particular attention to small traditional communities. Almost 90% of the territory of the enlarged Europe is made up of farmland containing precious wildlife reserves and cultural assets. Despite this, many policies regarding rural areas fail to reflect sufficiently their specific nature and their actual needs. Rapid urban growth has not only economic but also environmental, social and cultural implications, affecting the cultural heritage of rural areas, which remain an important part of our collective European memory and a source of creativity. The current trend is to target the most promising manifestations of our cultural heritage, that is to say the finest monuments, the best conserved old cities and major historical and archaeological sites. While their continued conservation is essential, similar attention must also be given to promoting Europe's rural and island areas, in particular small traditional communities. However, this valuable cultural heritage is constantly being undermined by social and technological progress, modern farming methods, unbridled economic exploitation and property development and human indifference. It is therefore essential to be aware of the importance of a natural way of life and the need for long-term management of the cultural heritage in rural areas to improve the quality of life of all European citizens. Effective policy in this area must be based on the following principles: a.        sustainable balance between the population and the environment, b.        an integrated approach to traditionally agricultural areas, transcending circumscribed sectoral concerns and involving consultation between the central authorities and local populace, c.        participation of the local populace in drafting and implementing policies and alignment between their views and decisions taken by the central authorities. The specific proposals contained in this report seek to ensure that the European Union, the Member States, the local authorities and non-governmental cultural organisations take specific measures to safeguard and develop Europe's natural and architectural cultural heritage, particularly in rural and island areas and small traditional communities. Its proposals include the following:\n"
