{"speaker": "Franco Frattini,", "english": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those who have made an important contribution to this debate, in the form of ideas and of truly interesting suggestions, and I fully intend to inform Mr Figel' about them. I should like to go back over just two points: that of the funding of the Culture 2000 project and that of the proposal, put forward specifically by the rapporteur, to make 2009 the European Cultural Heritage Year.\nWith regard to the first point, as you know far better than I do, the Culture 2000 project, which had a budget of EUR 167 million, is now due to be allocated EUR 400 million. The budget has thus been substantially increased thanks to the contribution and the political support of the European Parliament.\nAs regards the second issue concerning the European year, the Commission is taking the proposal made very seriously, and we will assess it in the context of our objectives and priority plans for the next few years. This proposal deserves to be carefully analysed. I also wish to take advantage of this opportunity to point out to you that my colleague, Mr Figel', recently made an important proposal aimed at making 2008 the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a proposal that the Commission has adopted. I hope that the opinion to be issued by Parliament will be along the same lines.\nThat being said, as I stated, I shall inform Mr Figel' of the outcome of this debate, in a spirit of constructive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .
