{"speaker": "Thomas Wise,", "english": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, I have not met many people who are not in favour of the protection of natural, architectural or cultural heritage.

However, although at face value this report has noble intentions, it serves to threaten Britain’s heritage. The proposals in the report have the specific aim of subsuming Britain’s distinct and diverse culture into the federalist fairytale creation of a common European culture. Sadly, many MEPs see culture purely as a tool for promoting European integration and pursuing a delusional project called ‘a United States of Europe’. Why can people here not understand that there is so such thing as a common European culture, no common history and no common heritage, just as there is no common architecture or common language? Europe is a continent formed of unique nation-states with very different histories and heritage. That is what makes Europe so very interesting and attractive.\nThe only way to achieve this report’s declared ambition of convincing Europe’s citizens that they share the same culture would be through lies. That is what frightens me. Today’s political elite seems to have no qualms about such deception. We have seen successive British governments seemingly deliberately and successfully keeping the British public in the dark about ‘project Europe’. What must be recognised is that the European Union’s integration agenda is one of the greatest threats to the heritage of every country in Europe that we have seen for decades. Sadly, reports such as these cannot see their own great contradiction.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, I have not met many people who are not in favour of the protection of natural, architectural or cultural heritage.
