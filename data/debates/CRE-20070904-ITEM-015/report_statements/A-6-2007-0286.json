    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the above communication on freight transport logistics in Europe and supports consultation with the relevant stakeholders in order to find solutions to existing bottlenecks;\n",
        "2.  Supports the intention of the Commission to present an Action Plan for freight logistics in Autumn 2007, which must serve to put logistics on the political agenda and raise its profile by focusing on its potential, appeal and usefulness;\n",
        "3.  Recognises the interest of the link made by the Commission between logistics and co-modality by means of defining it as looking at each mode individually and their integration in logistics chains, and that all transport modes should be encouraged to perform up to a competitive and sustainable standard; Simplification of administrative burden\n",
        "4.  Notes that logistics is primarily a business activity; considers, however, that public authorities can play a role and act as  facilitators, especially with regard to improving the framework for multimodal freight transport;\n",
        "5.  Recognises the importance of developing \"one stop administrative\" shopping in the sector to increase efficiency, cut red tape and reduce costs;\n",
        "6.  Welcomes the intention of the Commission to examine the details and added value of establishing a single transport document, as an EU model, for all carriage of goods, irrespective of mode; considers, however, that such a document must provide transport undertakings with clear legal certainty and replace the large number of existing transport documents;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Commission to intensify work on simplifying  short sea shipping procedures and making the concept of the Motorways of the Sea more operational; likewise advocates additional proposals for inland waterways under the NAIADES initiative, calls for a European coordinator to be appointed in the near future to deal with the Motorways of the Sea, which are included among the TEN-T priority projects;\n",
        "8.  Supports the discussion begun by the Commission, prompted by its Green Paper entitled ‘Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union: A European vision for the oceans and seas' (COM(2006)0275), as regards a future ‘Common European Maritime Space’, and calls on the Commission to put foward proposals whereby intra-Community cabotage would cease to be treated as international transport in the medium term; Intelligent transport systems\n",
        "9.  Notes the importance to logistics of advanced information and communication systems and the development of \"intelligent transport\" notably through Galileo and other EU initiatives, e.g. SESAR (European Air Traffic Management System), ERTMS (European rail signalling system), RIS (River Information Services), and SafeSeaNet, as well as innovative tracking and tracing systems;\n",
        "10. Highlights the importance of intelligent transport systems (ITS) for improving the efficiency of all modes of transport and encourages the use of these systems as a matter of priority within the EU, while paying particular attention to their full interoperability and ensuring  equal access to them, especially insofar as  SMEs are concerned;\n",
        "11. Stresses the importance of developing e-freight as a means of reducing red tape, speeding-up procedures and providing the opportunity to rationalise and reduce the number of forms to be completed, especially in trans-frontier freight transport;\n",
        "12. Insists that in order to make ITS fully operational at EU level, further compatibility and interoperability between old and new systems is essential;\n",
        "13. Recognises that the development of ITS needs to be properly financed and supported by appropriate training programmes, in which special attention is paid to ensuring full access by SMEs;Infrastructures and Investment policy\n",
        "14. Deplores the impact of the Council’s position on TEN-T funding on the development of freight transport logistics in the EU; urges the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take the opportunity offered by the 2008-2009 debate on financing EU policies to resolve definitively the permanent problem of under-financing of the common transport policy, especially as regards TENs and ITS projects; proposes that the added value of the logistics component be taken into account  in future TEN-T funding decisions;\n",
        "15. To boost the revitalisation of European railways, thereby increasing their freight-carrying capacity, urges the Commission to devise and develop a dedicated rail system and to put forward initiatives aimed at bringing it about, focusing especially on cross-border corridors and the development of intermodal hubs; likewise urges all Member States to support such an initiative at national level;\n",
        "16. Asks the Commission to ensure the dissemination of best practice in financing logistics as part of the Action Plan, for example, various initiatives using private-public co-financing, European Investment Bank  and European Investment Fund  possibilities and structural instruments; calls on the Commission to try to extend  solutions currently under development for mid-and long term EU projects, such as Galileo, to other infrastructure projects; Training and attractiveness of logistics professions\n",
        "17. Welcomes the fact that the Commission recognises training and life-long training as a priority and supports the proposal to develop common training standards and benchmarks on a voluntary basis, as well as mutual recognition of the skills, knowledge and competences of all the personnel involved in transport and logistics;\n",
        "18. Insists that the current lack of qualified personnel in logistics at all levels and though all sectors could be overcome by offering suitable training and, accordingly, enhancing the attractiveness of the profession ;Urban transport\n",
        "19. Supports the intention of the Commission to adopt a Green Paper on Urban Transport and calls for the inclusion of a chapter on urban logistics with particular emphasis on the dissemination of best practice ;Standardisation\n",
        "20. Calls for an in-depth study to be prepared by the Commission on the appropriateness of various weights and measures standards in the freight transport sector in the light of technological change and current circumstances, after full consultation with all the parties involved;\n",
        "21. Insists that the Action Plan for Logistics should support innovative logistics, co-modality, and safer and sustainable mobility; proposes that the use of 60 t goods vehicles should only be allowed for certain routes by the Commission at the request of, and within a Member State; considers that in the evaluation of such requests due regard must, in particular, be paid to  factors such as the existing infrastructures and safety considerations; Security\n",
        "22. Notes that the security of transport is a theme which the Commission intends to address in its Action Plan; insists that the actions to be taken should ensure the highest level of security while reinforcing the EU's position at international level; however, emphasises at the same time the need for a balanced relationship between security procedures and free movement of goods, a point which was also raised by the Commission;\n",
        "23. Notes that the security of freight transport loadings against theft, robbery and hijacking is likely not to be properly addressed by the Action Plan; insist that actions should be taken to fight organised crime, especially in cross-border areas and in international freight transport involving third countries; Planning\n",
        "24. Calls on the Member States to prepare national action plans for freight logistics within the overall framework of the EU Action Plan;\n",
        "25. Supports the Commission proposal to set up \"focal groups\" to address bottlenecks but stresses that this activity must not be confined to examining modes separately and without a developed overview; emphasises in this context that management strategies intended to promote greater utilisation of fleet capacity and the smoothly functioning use of infrastructure possess considerable potential for sustainable freight transport logistics;\n",
        "26. Calls for close and permanent cooperation among all relevant stakeholders in transport and logistics at both national and European level to deal, inter alia, with the practical elimination of existing bottlenecks;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to discuss the future challenges and possible solutions for freight transport logistics in Europe at a European logistics forum to be held annually; Statistics\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to make progress as rapidly as possible in developing an updated and efficient statistical database for EU logistics which is confined to effective and essential data and does not involve any unnecessary effort on the part of the undertakings concerned and, in so doing, to take care not to impose additional reporting requirements on European industry;\n",
        "29. Calls, in particular, for progress to be made in establishing a common set of units of measurement and agreed terminology for statistical purposes across the Member States and obtaining more information on container movements;\n",
        "30. Stresses the importance of the free movement of goods in the Community and therefore asks the Commission to increase its efforts to encourage proper implementation and enforcement of existing regulations and directives; o o   o\n",
        "31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
