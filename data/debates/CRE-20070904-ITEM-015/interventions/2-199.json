{"speaker": "Liam Aylward,", "english": "Liam Aylward, on behalf of the UEN Group . – Mr President, I welcome the contents of this report today, which supports the broader development of trans-European road networks in Europe.\nThe second largest road development in Ireland at present is the construction of a 112 km road called the M3, which will by-pass the towns of Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells in County Meath.\nThere has been a lot of press coverage recently in Ireland about the role of the Commission in the context of the M3. Some people who oppose this development have totally misrepresented the role of the Commission in this matter. I want to set the record straight as to the exact role of the Commission concerning the M3. On 29 June 2007 the Commission sent a letter by reasoned opinion to the Irish Government, seeking an explanation as to why the Irish Government did not carry out a second impact assessment when there was an archaeological discovery at Lismullen last March. The Irish Government will defend its position because it acted only after independent reports from the Director of the National Museum of Ireland were given to the Irish Government. This report recommended that this find at Lismullen be excavated and preserved by record. This proposed plan of action was supported by the Chief State Archaeologist in Ireland. However, the Commission sending a letter by reasoned opinion to the Irish Government does not mean, as has been reported, that Ireland is going to be fined hundreds of millions of euros by the European Union or that the building of this road, which has commenced, has to stop, or that legal action will be taken against Ireland. I know that this is an emotive issue, but the role of the European Union in this issue has to be put into perspective.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Liam Aylward, on behalf of the UEN Group . – Mr President, I welcome the contents of this report today, which supports the broader development of trans-European road networks in Europe.\nThe second largest road development in Ireland at present is the construction of a 112 km road called the M3, which will by-pass the towns of Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells in County Meath.\nThere has been a lot of press coverage recently in Ireland about the role of the Commission in the context of the M3.
