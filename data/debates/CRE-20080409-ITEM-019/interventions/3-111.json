Gradual integration of the former Yugoslav republics is crucial for stability in the Western Balkan region.\nAlthough there is still a lot of work to be done, especially in the areas of minority rights, border-related issues and judicial reform, Croatia should continue vigorously with its efforts to obtain membership of the EU as soon as possible in accordance with the accession criteria. Croatia's future membership is a logical next step, following the accession of Slovenia in 2004, to increase EU involvement in the region and encourage neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as all the other Western Balkan countries to continue with the consolidation of democracy. For the better administration of this process the Western Balkan region should follow the example of the Nordic Council.\nThe Slovenian Presidency and the upcoming French Presidency should provide Croatia with all the necessary support to overcome the final obstacles on its way to becoming a member of the European Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Toomas Savi (ALDE), in writing . – Mr President, I welcome the progress that Croatia has made towards concluding the accession negotiations in 2009.
