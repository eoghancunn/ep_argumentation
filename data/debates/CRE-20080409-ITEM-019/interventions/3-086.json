Frankly speaking, the people of Macedonia deserve far better treatment from us.\nWith the independence of Kosovo and the recent failure of NATO accession, the situation is even more complicated. In Macedonia there are separatist elements on one side and nationalists on the other who try to challenge the stability of the country, and the Bucharest decision does not help the situation at all. But perhaps our Macedonian friends can learn at least one lesson from Bucharest. It is not enough to get the support of the US. Many decisions depend on the common accord of the Member States, not only in the European Union but also in NATO, and any Member State may use its veto.\nIn the light of the latest events Macedonia should reconsider its standpoint on exempting the US from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Many mistakes were committed on both sides – by us and the Macedonian politicians – but we cannot punish ordinary people for our mistakes. That is why at least in the field of visa liberalisation we should act quickly, assisting the Macedonian people to travel, learn and have closer contacts with everyday European life. Three and a half years ago when I was elected Vice-Chairman of the EU-Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I had many optimistic plans on how to improve our relationships. Very few of these ideas were realised.
