{"speaker": "Józef Pinior (PSE). –", "english": "Józef Pinior (PSE). – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Erik Meijer on their 2007 progress reports on Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively. Both reports are excellent. As a Socialist Group shadow for the report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I would like to thank Mr Meijer for his serious and honest cooperation during the making of this report.\nThe report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia hails the achievements in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which deals with the political aspect of inter-ethnic relations. The report comments on economic performance, the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors, and progress in the fight against corruption. On the negative side, we regret the signing of the Bilateral Immunity Agreement by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the United States, which grants exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in contradiction of EU standards and policies.\nThe report calls on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece to increase efforts to overcome the dispute on the name of the country. That should in no circumstances become an obstacle to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s membership of international organisations. On the name issue, the report does not criticise either of the two sides. It only encourages both sides to carry on negotiations, despite what happened at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last week. Fortunately Javier Solana said yesterday in the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee that negotiations on the name will continue. If the two sides agree, NATO can take a decision to invite the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia immediately, even at ambassador level, so a new summit will be needed. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could get a date for the start of accession negotiations this year. The European Parliament should give a clear lead for the country towards European integration.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Józef Pinior (PSE). – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Erik Meijer on their 2007 progress reports on Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively.
