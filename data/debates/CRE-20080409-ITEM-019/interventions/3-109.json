We are indeed glad to notice that a number of new negotiation chapters have been opened. The accession of Croatia should become a driving example for all other candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans.\nDespite the substantial efforts made by Croatia to meet EU standards, there are still areas where attention should given such as: the fight against corruption and organised crime, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal, the fight against all forms of discrimination (especially with regard to the Roma and national minorities), the sound use of Community funds, environmental protection measures and public administration reform.\nThese points are essential, as further developments in the above areas would indeed bring greater stability to the country and to the region as a whole. It is clear that the stabilisation of the Western Balkans through the Europeanisation process should remain a top priority objective, for which the finalisation of the accession of Croatia will definitely be a major step forward.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – Without any doubt, since the accession negotiations started, Croatia has made decisive efforts to comply with the requirements of the acquis communautaire.
