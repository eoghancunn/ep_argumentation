{"speaker": "Hannes Swoboda,", "english": "Hannes Swoboda, rapporteur . − Madam President, our group congratulates you on your election. We supported that very much and we wish you all the best.\n(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate, which has been highly productive and constructive. I should like to take up on what Mr Schmitt said regarding 2009. I believe we shall find a common solution tomorrow, as it is important to have a common broad base.\nWhy has Croatia been successful? This is because a broad consensus has been achieved in the country and, despite a slight disagreement with regard to the composition of the Joint EU Committee, this will hopefully be the case in future as well. It is also because – even if the country has sometimes had to force itself to do so – it has achieved a real consensus with its neighbours, as was the case with the fishing zone, for instance.\nTherefore – if I can now establish a link to Macedonia – I should like to make a very clear appeal to our counterparts in Macedonia to learn from this example, to try to reach a consensus at domestic level and also with its neighbours.\nIt is easy, of course, to add fuel to the fire here and, like Mrs Beer, to act as a great advocate. As Mrs Pack and many others have said, however, both countries – Greece and Macedonia – have to make a move: and this within the next few days. Making a Macedonian domestic political crisis out of it at this point in time does not help Macedonia. It blocks the path to the EU; it prevents a solution being found with Greece.\nHence the link with Croatia I mentioned. Croatia has succeeded thanks to three really very good governments – including the Račan and Sanader governments – which have really taken substantial steps forward and also changed their spots when ‘national interests’ were involved. Hence my appeal once again to continue to establish this common ground in Croatia, my appeal to attempt something similar in Macedonia as well, and my appeal to the Presidency to continue what it has been doing in recent weeks, namely making progress for the region as a whole. I am convinced, Commissioner, that the Commission will do everything it can to bring the negotiations to a close in 2009.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hannes Swoboda, rapporteur . − Madam President, our group congratulates you on your election.
