It is simply not a free market in the sense we understand.\nThey need to implement transparency in government contracts, which are subject to graft. They need to implement full disclosure of interest in planning decisions, which, at the moment, just provide income for officials. We have a short window of opportunity to urge reform on Croatia before accession. I am not convinced that we are using it adequately.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Roger Helmer (NI). – Madam President, I think this report is too optimistic by half.\nLast year, I spent a very intensive week in Croatia in meetings with diplomats, academics, lawyers, businessmen, chambers of commerce and the media.
