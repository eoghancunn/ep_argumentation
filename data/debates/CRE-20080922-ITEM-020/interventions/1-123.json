{"speaker": "Frank Vanhecke (NI). -", "english": "Frank Vanhecke (NI). - (NL) Mr President, it was with mixed feelings that I read the 2007 report of the Committee on Petitions. Positive feelings in the first instance, because it goes without saying that our citizens are entitled to see all legislation properly applied. Naturally I have no problem with people turning to any organisation, including of course the European Parliament, in order to get those laws implemented if a national or local authority refuses to do so. The 2007 report is full of examples of cases where the Committee on Petitions was quite right to take action.\nBut my feelings were mixed, because on the other hand I am particularly wary of and alarmed by the growing encroachment of European law, by more and more European meddling and interfering in things which to my mind are unquestionably matters for subsidiarity and would really be better left to Member States. In my own region of Flanders, for example, we have increasingly seen Europe meddling in matters of major concern to us. I am thinking especially of the defence of our Dutch language, of our culture and identity in our capital city of Brussels and in the area of Flanders around Brussels, the Vlaamse Rand . On issues like these we find Eurocrats who know very little about it all preaching to us in very general terms and telling us what to do. That makes us particularly angry, and it is unacceptable.\nI also see that this report repeatedly refers to the procedures set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. And I must stress once again that following the ‘no’ vote in Ireland, this Lisbon Treaty is politically and legally a dead duck. We of the Committee on Petitions, perhaps more than any other members of this House, must show respect for the legal realities and the democratically expressed voice of the people, in this case the people of Ireland, who have consigned the Lisbon Treaty to the dustbin of history.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Frank Vanhecke (NI). - (NL) Mr President, it was with mixed feelings that I read the 2007 report of the Committee on Petitions.
