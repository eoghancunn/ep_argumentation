{"speaker": "Charlie McCreevy,", "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I am taking part in this debate on behalf of my colleague Margot Wallström.\nThe work of the Committee on Petitions is a fascinating source of insight into the concerns and grievances of citizens concerning European affairs. They cover a wide range of policy areas, although land-use planning and environmental issues crop up very often; they cover practically all Member States, and they cover a broad cross-section of civil society, from the individual citizen right up to the multi-national non-governmental organisation. Your rapporteur is right, I believe, to underline the importance of all the work represented by the thousand or more petitions you receive each year.\nThere are two aspects of the report and resolution which I would like to pick up. The first is the recent development of on-the-spot visits of the committee to the sites of grievances, and which can have a considerable impact in the media, and will no doubt raise the visibility of your work. These missions, besides the press and media coverage, also give rise to very informative reports and would seem to me to be of a high quality. I think that these are important records of your activity and that they deserve wide publicity. It is a big investment of your time and resources, but I am sure that it is one that pays off.\nThe second of the points I wish to raise is turned more to the future. I wish to reassure you once again of our intentions for the best possible collaboration between the Commission and Parliament. This collaboration is mutually reinforcing; the habit of collaboration instils a better exchange of information, and, as an outcome, a better all-round standard of service for our citizens. The recent increase in the workload in the petitions routine, described in the report, makes the need for an efficient and effective interinstitutional collaboration all the more important. I would like you to know that we will do our best to make it work.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I am taking part in this debate on behalf of my colleague Margot Wallström.\nThe work of the Committee on Petitions is a fascinating source of insight into the concerns and grievances of citizens concerning European affairs.
