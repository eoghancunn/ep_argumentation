{"speaker": "Thomas Wise,", "english": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, it is not often that a member of the UK Independence Party congratulates a rapporteur in this House. In this case I will make a rare exception.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has estimated that the catch of 70% of fish species on this planet has already reached or exceeded maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The common fisheries policy, with the disgraceful problem of discards that results from it, has made a major contribution to what is potentially a grave ecological disaster, especially in the North Sea.\nIn the 1980s, the Canadian Government was warned by fishermen that cod was being dangerously overfished. The Government ignored the warnings and, by 1992, the cod fishery totally collapsed. A similar situation now seems to be evolving in European waters.\nThe rapporteur refers to deficient analysis and inadequate solutions offered by the Commission’s communication, which she goes on to describe as simplistic. The Commission has recently been criticised for the way it gathers and interprets statistics on maritime issues. In a recent briefing, the British Government refers to ‘an absence of necessary data on what the appropriate targets should be’. The Commission’s interpretation of MSY is based on outdated models and dogmatic ecological concepts. It clearly demonstrates the desire to gain further competences at any cost.\nThe loss of our fishing stocks is too high a price to pay, and I thank the rapporteur for being honest in her condemnation of the Commission’s communication. It surely says something when the Europhile PPE-DE Group is echoing the UKIP line.
