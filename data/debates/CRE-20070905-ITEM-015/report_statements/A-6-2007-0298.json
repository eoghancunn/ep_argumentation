    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the Commission's communication with the greatest interest, notably its recognition that the existing fisheries management policy has failed and its objective of creating a new management model making it possible to ensure stock recovery, adapt the fishing effort to fisheries' real circumstances, and improve the reliability and stability of the fishing fleet;\n",
        "2.  Stresses the need for all future measures altering the current Community system of conservation and management to be taken with the full involvement of fishermen and to be based on scientific fisheries research;\n",
        "3.  Highlights the need to increase the appropriations earmarked for scientific fisheries research in the seventh framework programme for research and technological development so that this programme can contribute to improving the Community fisheries conservation system through the development of theoretical fisheries management models, their application, improved analysis of the state of stocks, natural effects and other inter-species relationships, and improved fishing gear;\n",
        "4.  Notes the Commission's intention to achieve those objectives by making MSY the yardstick for fisheries management, but warns that, for a large majority of scientists and also for the FAO, the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which conceive the ecosystem as a whole and incorporate aspects relating to the environment, species interrelation, economic and social factors, etc;\n",
        "5.  Notes that leading scientists have in recent years developed new methods, based on computer simulations of fisheries, which emulate the MSY approach while not taking it as an explicit target, and take due account of uncertainties, environmental factors, and possible interactions between species, and which could in principle be extended to take into account specified social and economic factors;\n",
        "6.  Warns that it will be difficult to apply the MSY model to multispecies fisheries (i.e. the majority of those in the EU), since if the MSY applied were that of the main species the others could be overfished, while if, as would seem logical, one applied that of the most vulnerable species it would be necessary to stop catching those species that were in a good biological state, with adverse effects in economic, employment and competitiveness terms, a situation which would be in total contradiction with the notion of MSY as such;\n",
        "7.  Is, therefore, obliged to deplore the deficient analysis and inadequate solutions offered by the Commission's communication, with regard to the above aspects in particular, and, in general terms, the absence of an in-depth evaluation of what applying an MSY model would actually mean, in terms of its shortcomings, the particularities of its application, and the potential risks of any errors in the model; also regrets, notably, the absence of an analysis of the evolution of the MSY concept and the potential advantages of the different approaches;\n",
        "8.  Considers, therefore, that the time is not ripe to propose the introduction of an MSY system, and that a deeper and more rigorous analysis is needed of the problems, shortcomings and objectives of the Community's conservation and management policy as such, with a view to deciding, with all political courage, the most suitable measures for introducing the changes that are most needed to the present CFP;\n",
        "9.  Is perplexed, given the above, at the recent measures announced by the Commission for the purpose of complying with the MSY model, such as the regulation laying down the TACs and quotas for 2007[3], when the Commission itself has recognised, in various debates and institutional contexts, that numerous studies are still needed on different aspects of the application of MSY;\n",
        "10. Is concerned that, in the context of the ambitious objective of changing the approach of the conservation and management system for the CFP, advantage is not being taken of the opportunity to provide a clear definition of the system of access to resources, and that the TAC/quota system and the fishing effort system are continuing to overlap; believes that the Commission must seize this opportunity to devise a system of access to resources that puts the accent on sustainability, discourages discards, simplifies the technical measures, eliminates discrimination and excessive competition for stocks, introduces the necessary flexibility, and boosts the sector's competitiveness;\n",
        "11. Stresses that any change to the management system must necessarily include suitable and financially acceptable compensation mechanisms, and that this will require an assessment of the social and economic impact of the final proposal, and calls on the Commission to devise these measures simultaneously with the new management system and if possible integrate the two;\n",
        "12. Insists that the poor state of both the fish stocks in European waters, and the difficulties faced by the EU fishing industry, mean that action must be taken as soon as possible, and that further delays can only lead to further hardship to the industry and delays to its return to profitability;\n",
        "13. Calls for the above steps to be taken prior to any decision; requests, accordingly, an open-ended debate involving most parties in order to examine other possible management approaches, with a view to achieving the broadest possible consensus for the necessary changes to the Community management policy;\n",
        "14. Calls, all in all, for the phasing-in of a system which can finally produce a fisheries policy that is ever more in line with the biological capacity of stocks that are in recovery, so that the sustainability of the Community's fisheries evolves towards becoming a given rather than an anxiety, and that such is the perception wherever Community fishermen are to be found in the world; which can equip the fleet with the necessary stability, on the basis of sound and ever more long-term-oriented planning; and which can, ultimately, introduce a stable system of access to resources in which TACs and quotas need only be modified in specific circumstances and using semi-automatic mechanisms, instead of being altered every year on grounds that are not purely scientific;\n",
        "15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
