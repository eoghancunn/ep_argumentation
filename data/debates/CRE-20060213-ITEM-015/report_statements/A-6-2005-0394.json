        "1.  Expresses its great concern that, as far as the specific cases referred to in the petitions are concerned, the Greek authorities did not apply the exemption laid down in Directive 83/182/EEC;\n",
        "2.  Notes that in spite of this the Greek customs authorities claimed that the petitioners were guilty of evasion or attempted evasion of payment of the tax and failure to observe the formalities laid down by the Greek Customs Code; notes also that the petitioners were required to pay an increased duty amounting to up to ten times the customs duty;\n",
        "3.  Considers that the administrative measures as a whole, which Greece has decided are appropriate in the field of customs contraventions and which, as far as the petitioners are concerned, have led to penalties amounting to many times the original purchase price of the vehicle, impede the free movement of goods and persons;\n",
        "4.  Is aware of the fact that, in the absence of harmonisation of Community legislation in the field of the penalties applicable, when conditions laid down by arrangements under such legislation are not observed, the Member States are empowered to choose the penalties which seem appropriate to them; considers, nevertheless, that Member States must exercise that power in accordance with Community law and its general principles, and consequently with the principle of proportionality;\n",
        "5.  Is aware of the fact that the choice of penalty when dealing with infringements relating to temporary importation of certain means of transport is a matter of national law, as is the question of ascertaining whether account must be taken of the good faith of the offender; considers, nevertheless, that in order to promote the freedoms guaranteed by the Treaties, account must be taken of the good faith of the offender when determining the penalty to be imposed on him, where determination of the rules applicable has given rise to difficulties;\n",
        "6.  Notes that a very substantial number of vehicles have been seized, confiscated and sold at auction, which it considers incompatible with the principles of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, and in particular Chapter VI thereof (entitled \"Justice\"), and not justified by any overriding requirements of enforcement and prevention, when the gravity of the infringement is taken into account; remarks that, as the Court of Justice has previously pointed out, as regards the 'irregular' use of a vehicle in another Member State, penalties other than confiscation are possible;  7.   Considers the confiscation of the vehicles, and the fact that the petitioners are deprived of the use thereof for many years, to be contrary to the right of property and freedom of movement, and that the petitioners have a right to be properly compensated, bearing in mind the prejudice caused to their livelihood and good character; 8   Urges the Greek authorities without delay to fulfil the Hellenic Republic's obligations under the Treaty and to comply with the rules laid down in Community legislation and particularly Directive 83/182/EEC, so that the Commission may withdraw its legal action;\n",
        "9.  Should the Greek authorities fail to do that, calls on the Commission to proceed without delay with its legal action against the Hellenic Republic;\n",
        "10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying explanatory statement to the Council, the Commission and the Greek Government and Parliament.\n"
