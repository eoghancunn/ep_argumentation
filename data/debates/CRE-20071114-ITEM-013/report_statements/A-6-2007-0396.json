        "8.  Calls on Ukraine to further draw up and implement customs legislation that is in conformity with international and EU Standards and to improve the functioning of the customs service by simplifying and modernising customs procedures both at borders and inland; calls on the Commission to support Ukraine's efforts in this area by providing additional technical assistance and dedicated financial support;\n",
        "9.  Notes that, notwithstanding the fact that the most competitive products imported from Ukraine into the EU are not part of the EU's generalised tariff preferences (GSP) scheme, this system has been extremely helpful to Ukrainian producers wishing to enter the Community markets; calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider further liberalisation vis-à-vis Ukraine by granting eligibility for special preferential arrangements under the so-called \"labour rights\" clause (grating preferential treatment to countries like Ukraine which have implemented International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions on core labour rights);\n",

        "15. Notes with concern that, despite the efforts of the Ukrainian Government, corruption is still widely practised in the country and plays a major role in stifling economic growth and  access of foreign capital; urges the Government of Ukraine to take the appropriate initiatives to fight against corruption particularly addressing the underlying causes of it;\n",
        "16. Notes that the cast iron and steel sector represents the bulk of Ukrainian manufacturing exports and the biggest source of trade revenue for the country; welcomes the conclusion of the steel agreement of 18 June 2007, which allowed a substantial increase in the quotas of Ukrainian steel products admitted into the Community and facilitated a more effective though gradual liberalisation of trade in goods between Ukraine and the EU; believes that this agreement will contribute significantly to promoting the objectives of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) and will pave the way for better integrated markets within WTO provisions when quantitative restrictions are lifted;\n",

        "22. Calls for the reinforcement of high-level dialogue between Ukraine and the EU in the energy sector in order to fully implement the Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in the field of energy between Ukraine and the EU;\n",
        "23. Considers, in light of the need for more sustainable trade patterns in order to combat climate change, that access to energy resources is a matter of multilateral rule-setting which must not be undermined by bilateral trade agreements that compete for the most favourable access conditions;\n",
        "24. Calls on Ukraine to develop a consistent approach towards energy aimed at ensuring the diversification and the security of energy supplies running through the Ukrainian territory, nuclear safety, a reform of its domestic energy market, the development and modernisation of energy sector infrastructures (including pipelines), an efficient utilisation of energy and a better exploitation of renewable energy sources;\n",

        "28. Encourages the Ukrainian authorities to implement all necessary and effective measures to neutralise the sources of illegal activity, such as optical disc plants manufacturing infringing copies of copyright products and Internet sites containing illegal copyright materials, and to eradicate piracy from markets, such as the Petrovka market in Kiev; notes that those measures should include repeated and unannounced inspections with the cooperation of rights holders;\n",
        "29. Emphasises the need to adapt the current court system in order to effectively protect intellectual property rights (IPRs) and ensure more speedy prosecutions and sentencing of all persons involved in the illegal trade, i.e. both manufacturers and sellers; notes that the Ukrainian judiciary and courts should be instructed to confiscate and destroy obviously pirated and counterfeit materials as a rule;\n",

        "36. Welcomes the recent signature of a Memorandum of Understanding on a structured dialogue on agricultural issues; stresses that the agricultural sector fulfils important functions with regard to environmental preservation, food sovereignty and social balancing as regards discrepancies between rural and urban development, which can justify sectoral tariffs that are higher than tariffs on non-agricultural goods;\n",
        "37. Urges that the farming and rural population be supported by improving its economic and health situation and developing rural areas; stresses that such support should take the form of financial and infrastructure support, facilitating access to loans for small producers, introducing a weighting system for aid that favours small and young entrepreneurs, and creating vocational training programmes; stresses the need also to create a network for the regional interconnection of rural and urban areas and improve access to information in rural areas;\n",

        "42. Takes note of Ukraine's conditional adhesion to the Single economic space (SES) with Russia and other former Soviet Union Republics; recalls that certain provisions included in the SES agreement, if fully implemented, might be in conflict with the establishment of a functioning FTA with the EU; calls on Ukraine to develop its economic relations with the Russian Federation in a way which would not hamper a progressive and deeper integration of the country into the Community's Single Market;\n",
        "43. Calls on the Commission to promote a three-way dialogue between Ukraine, Russia and the EU so as to foster a climate of security and peace in the region, a dialogue which should enable Ukraine to strengthen its own independent identity without becoming isolated; stresses the need to encourage dialogue on common interests, in particular with regard to security and defence, energy and the development of a quantitatively and qualitatively more efficient transport network, among other topics on the international agenda;\n",
