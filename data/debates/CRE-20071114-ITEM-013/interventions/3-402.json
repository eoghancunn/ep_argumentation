Since 2004, the EU has been the most important trade partner of Ukraine, and the eastern expansion of the Union’s borders has definitively opened up new opportunities for trade, industrial cooperation and economic growth in the region.\nIn this respect, it is of the utmost importance for the Union to actively support the WTO accession of Ukraine, following which it will be possible to establish a genuine EU-Ukraine free trade area within a sound and transparent institutional framework. Generally speaking, it is indeed in the interests of the Union to foster a good commercial, economic and social performance in Ukraine in order to secure trade relations and political stability in the region.\nWe therefore support the call for a coordinated global response to the political, economic and social challenges in Eastern Central Europe.
