{"speaker": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). – Mr President, EU money that is lost or unaccounted for often hits the headlines. It is a pity that the work done to prevent money being lost in the first place – and to recover funds that are lost – is all too often too technical, too tedious to be reported at all, let alone hit the headlines. However, efforts to recover funds are being made and should be supported, although, as the rapporteur clearly points out, more needs to be done.\nIn particular, more needs to be done on the recovery of funds where there is shared management. We need to rely on the full cooperation of the national authorities to help us succeed. Sometimes I get the feeling that, as long as we are talking about Community funds, national authorities are not quite so keen to do their part. In effect they are saying: ‘Our responsibility is the national budget, and that is it’. However, that is not it. When EU money is spent at national level, it is clear that national authorities are actively involved. National authorities also bear a strong responsibility for ensuring that Community funds are not spent erroneously, irregularly, or even fraudulently. If they are, then action is taken to recover them.\nThe report rightly calls for Member States to stand up and be counted, to do their part, to better organise themselves and to cooperate more with the Commission so that the recovery of funds is effective and becomes a deterrent in itself.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). – Mr President, EU money that is lost or unaccounted for often hits the headlines.
