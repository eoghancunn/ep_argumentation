{"speaker": "Dalia Grybauskaitė,", "english": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Casaca for a very good, interesting and useful report. It takes account of direct management, which is mainly the responsibility of the Commission, and shared management, which the Commission shares with the Member States.\nRegarding recoveries in direct management, the Commission thanks the rapporteur for his support in the current revision of financial regulation which we have already placed on the table, in particular the proposals aiming to establish a uniform time limit of five years, and of course the level of privilege for Community entitlement to fiscal claims in national law which, to our regret, the Council was reluctant to support.\nRegarding recoveries in shared management, the Commission agrees with the emphasis placed on the responsibility of the Member States, since this accounts for the biggest part of Community expenditure. The Commission shares the rapporteur’s analysis concerning the low level of recoveries by some Member States. In one particular case, the sum involved is EUR 95 million.\nHowever, I would like to mention that this Commission has laid special emphasis on recovery. Between 2003 and 2006, the Commission was able to reduce recovery amounts from EUR 553 million to only EUR 160 million by September this year. The specific case of the 95 million is the subject of a criminal investigation in the court of one Member State and another is involved in the problem. So in fact less than EUR 100 million have to be recovered in the near future, and EUR 95 million after the investigation has been completed.\nWe are very satisfied with the report as a whole. We are working with Parliament, especially the rapporteur on the Financial Regulation. We are cooperating closely with the Committee on Budgets on that. We shall give a proper response to your report and your recommendations in writing.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission .
