    "paragraphs": [
        "1.Welcomes the Commission's action to modernise competition policy and, in particular, its reinforced stance on combating cartels, its renewed targeting of unauthorised State aid and its sector inquiries; congratulates the Commission on the steps it has taken towards the improved functioning of the European Competition Network (ECN); congratulates the Commission on its achievements in the area of multilateral and bilateral cooperation and calls for further progress in its activities towards the international convergence of competition policy;\n",
        "2.Welcomes the preference attributed by the Commission to an economic rather than rules-based approach to competition policy enforcement; welcomes the Commission's approach in its sector inquiries, which is closer to the realities of business practices, particularly as regards the financial services and energy sectors; further stresses that those inquiries should shed light on the current sector situation and trends in the targeted sectors and should stimulate a forward-focused policy;\n",
        "3.Welcomes the Commission’s efforts to improve the quality of enforcement of decisions in the context of the ECN through increased cooperation with and among national competition authorities (NCAs);\n",
        "4.Renews the call, as regards cooperation with and enforcement by NCAs, for further progress in the reduction of uncertainty caused by diverging interpretations of EC competition law by national courts, as well as discrepancies in the speed, content and enforcement of final decisions; calls on the Commission to consider the creation of a network of judicial authorities, comparable to the ECN;\n",
        "5.Renews the call in relation to services of general economic interest (SGEIs) given the considerable differences in policies prevailing across the Member States, for further progress in relation to both the clarification of the existing competition rules and their practical application;\n",
        "6.Welcomes the increase in the adoption of procedures within the ECN Model Leniency  Programme; stresses, however, that further refinement of that instrument is required in order to avoid its possible misuse, in particular by unfairly disadvantaging the weaker participants in the collusion;\n",
        "7.Recalls, in this light, the need to coordinate the dual instruments of damages actions and leniency procedures, in order to ensure that adequate incentives for proper behaviour are in place;\n",
        "8.Expresses concern about the excessive delay in the processes of recovery of unauthorised State aid granted by several Member States; stresses that the inadequate enforcement of rules in this area may seriously harm fair competition;\n",
        "9.Welcomes the adoption of EC competition rules by the most recently acceded Member States and recommends the continued refinement of the quality of the implementation of such rules;\n",
        "10.Notes the key role that adequate competition policy can play towards achieving the Lisbon Strategy goals; recalls that the role of competition policy can be enhanced if it is adequately coupled with a cohesion policy;\n",
        "11.Calls on the Commission to consider carefully how tax competition among the Member States is affected by certain taxation practices, especially in relation to companies;\n",
        "12.Takes the view that some of the taxation practices applied by certain Swiss cantons constitute State aid contravening the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 and distorting competition, and calls on the Member States to finalise a clear-cut negotiating brief for the Commission in this regard;\n",
        "13.Supports the Commission’s efforts to introduce an EU wide common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB), since this will make for easier comparison, and draws attention to the views endorsed in its resolution of 13 December 2005 on taxation of undertakings in the European Union: a common consolidated corporate tax base[13];\n",
        "14.Reaffirms the need for an increased role of Parliament, including the promotion of co-decision powers, in the formulation of competition law;\n",
        "15.Recalls the need to promote adequate capacity-building at EU level in order to meet the ambitious Lisbon Strategy goals and cope with the possible high levels of staff in businesses and NCAs;\n",
        "16.Welcomes the efforts to strengthen the ECN's role in the field of competition enforcement through the harmonisation of practices and interpretation of norms, as well as the delegation of competences and the exchange of experiences among NCAs;\n",
        "17.Expresses its concern at the relative failure to date in achieving genuine competition in the energy markets; notes that in many Member States ownership unbundling has proven insufficient to ensure adequate competition, as very high market shares of incumbent operators are associated with insufficient market access and market foreclosure;\n",
        "18.Strongly believes that the introduction of a level playing field that enables new market entry and facilitates the introduction of new environmentally friendly technologies must  be a priority; congratulates in this respect the Commission for making full use of its powers under competition, merger and State aid rules, in enhancing the efficiency of the energy market; welcomes the fact that in parallel to the enforcement of individual cases,  the energy sector inquiry has played an important role in the Commission's work on identifying necessary regulatory changes in particular issues such as achieving adequate unbundling of network and supply activities, removing regulatory gaps in particular regarding cross-border issues, addressing market concentration and barriers to entry, and increasing transparency in market operations;\n",
        "19.Underlines that the completion of ownership unbundling in the energy sector, alongside the dismantling of vertical conglomerates and guaranteeing conditions for effective market access should be given stronger priority;\n",
        "20.Welcomes the overall objective of the energy  inquiry which is to address the barriers currently impeding the development of an EU-wide energy market by 1st July 2007;  shares the views of the Commission that the powers of NCAs need to be strengthened and that coordination must be enhanced at EU level, particularly as regards to cross-border issues; calls on the Commission to pursue enforcement action including fines against companies which breach competition rules; encourages the Commission to proceed against Member States which unduly protect national energy companies;\n",
        "21.Calls on the Commission to examine the respective competition situations of rating agencies, auditing firms, and large investment banks;\n",
        "22.Stresses that competition law must be applied to all players on the European market, whether or not they have their headquarters in the European Union; considers it to be important for the Commission to act with equal firmness and consistency towards both third-country and EU undertakings;\n",
        "23.Welcomes the initiative taken by the Commission to commission a study to identify whether the rise in prices for energy is mainly due to the rise of fuel prices and to the impact of the Emission Trading Scheme, or whether it is due to the anti-competitive behaviour of market players;\n",
        "24.Recalls the Commission’s commitment to reviewing the ‘two-thirds rule’ as a threshold for finding a Community impact in regard to merger proposals; suggests that progress in this area and a more consistent approach in the evaluation of comparable merger operations would be welcome whenever decisions taken at national level could have a strong impact on the market structure of neighbouring Member States;\n",
        "25.Welcomes the Commission’s aim to support the inter-connectivity of infrastructure networks; calls for special attention to be paid to the specific features of peripheral markets;\n",
        "26.Welcomes the Commission’s Damages Green Paper and underlines that the right of victims who have suffered losses as a result of anti-competitive behaviour to obtain compensation must be effective;\n",
        "27.Applauds the Commission’s efforts to strengthen the instruments for tackling cartels, in particular, the revision of its leniency procedures and its new guidelines on the method of setting fines, which focus on long-standing agreements in large markets;\n",
        "28.Believes that the application of the EC and national merger control rules would benefit highly from cooperation among NCAs towards the implementation of a common database registering all the individual cases examined, in the context of a specific network for information exchange;\n",
        "29.Welcomes the Merger Remedies Study, which examines the impact of proposed remedy measures during the period 1996 to 2000; considers that such  ex-post examinations provide crucial policy insights, and consequently should be extended to other areas of competition policy enforcement;\n",
        "30.Notes that according to the Merger Remedies Study, the effectiveness of structural remedies is often undermined by the uncompetitive behaviour of the firms and public authorities, in particular, by the limitation of market access; consequently calls on the Commission to increase its vigilance as regards that possible loophole in merger remedy enforcement;\n",
        "31.Notes that State aid policy is an integral part of competition policy and that State aid control reflects the need to maintain a level playing field for all undertakings carrying out activities in the internal market; welcomes in this respect the Commission’s efforts to increase the transparency and public accountability of the existing mechanisms of State aid; welcomes further efforts to improve transparency in this context; stresses, furthermore, the need for clear criteria for measuring State aid levels;\n",
        "32.Reiterates its earlier call for follow-up and open reporting on the development of State aid, with comparisons between the Member States, with a view to achieving the desired objective of reducing such aid;\n",
        "33.Recalls the need to avoid competition and duplication among Member States’ State aid schemes, as well as any distortions that different national technical and financial capacities to support State aid may introduce in the internal market; suggests that further efforts by the Commission to harmonise national practices and promoting the exchange of information and best practices are of the utmost relevance;\n",
        "34.Recalls the principle of compatibility between State aid and EC cohesion policy; calls on the Commission, in view of the EC's objectives and its cohesion policies, to ensure that State aid does not result in distorted competition in terms of provoking the relocation of companies from one Member State to another, which may lead to subsidy-shopping by businesses without any added value for the common goals of the EC and, in particular, to the loss of jobs in one region for the benefit of another; recalls that regional aid approved outside authorised regional aid schemes intrinsically involves higher risks of distortion to competition;\n",
        "35.Welcomes the increased sensitivity of the Commission in relation to the Lisbon agenda issues in the context of State aid management and its concerns regarding the 'catching-up' regarding such matters of less developed regions in the European Union;\n",
        "36.Considers that EC State aid policy, particularly regarding sectors that operate in the globalised market, must focus on aid practices by third-country governments in relation to competitors; suggests, however, that a balance should be achieved by giving preference to efforts regarding cooperation and mutual recognition, rather than through subsidy competition;\n",
        "37.Recalls the need to guarantee that compliance with EC targets on climate control, combined with environmental State aid, across different countries and sectors, are compatible with competition objectives; calls on the Commission to address this issue in the forthcoming review of the environmental aid block exemption;\n",
        "38.Welcomes the progress made in the context of bilateral cooperation with the European Union's main partners, namely, the United States, Canada, Japan and Korea, including dialogue on issues of common concern such as merger remedies and cartel investigations; considers that cooperation to be of crucial importance to achieving the consistent enforcement of decisions on cases with a shared impact;\n",
        "39.Welcomes the Commission's cooperation with Chinese authorities towards the establishment of a competition authority in that China; urges the Commission to continue its efforts towards instituting an effective competition culture in that China;\n",
        "40.Stresses that the Commission’s analyses of the competition situation in various sectors as regards the acquisition of undertakings should be carried out in the light of the internal market as a whole and not principally with regard to the situation on local or national markets;\n",
        "41.Stresses that the Commission’s new trade agenda, in the context of which free trade agreements will be negotiated with selected partners, requires the close involvement of the Commissioner for Competition so that the main competition issues are appropriately dealt with in the context of such agreements;\n",
        "42.Calls upon the Council and the Commission to improve and better focus their joint efforts in the organisation of the Competition Day initiative to highlight to European consumers and citizens the crucial importance of EC competition policy in delivering economic growth and jobs throughout the European Union;\n",
        "43.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
