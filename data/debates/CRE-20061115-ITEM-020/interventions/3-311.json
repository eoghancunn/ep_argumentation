{"speaker": "Anna Záborská (PPE-DE).", "english": "Anna Záborská (PPE-DE). – ( SK ) I understand why, as a former diplomat and as a woman who has been involved in politics for years, Mrs Gomes has proposed this topic, and I congratulate her on it.\nI fully support the idea that the equal and full participation of women in the political process and in decision-making should fully reflect the true make-up of society. Such participation is important for future generations and for the proper functioning of democratic systems. There is no doubt that equality between the sexes in terms of dignity and responsibility fully justifies the rise of women to public positions. Genuine support for women in politics requires a clear acknowledgement of their value as mothers and their role in the family and this applies in relation to all other public functions and professions.\nIn addition, these functions and professions must be closely interlinked if we want social and cultural development to be genuinely and fully humane. Let us be honest. Women are always deeply involved in life’s difficult moments, where they make great peacemakers and mediators par excellence . We certainly need to do much more to ensure that the conditions under which women and mothers live and work do not result in any discrimination in the world of politics. In the future, women will be increasingly involved in the serious, hotly debated issues of the day. It is unusual to see a strong social presence of women in all areas, as women are naturally opposed to a society organised exclusively on the basis of efficiency and productivity, and they insist on redefining these systems in a more humane way.\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the wish that all women who are active in politics may become preachers of a new feminism, capable of appreciating and expressing the true talents of women in all areas of social life, without being tempted to imitate the models created by our male counterparts.
