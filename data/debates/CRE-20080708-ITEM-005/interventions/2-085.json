I agree that there will be no progress without stability; stability means good governance and it means troops and it means police.\nI think that some of our European allies are merely paying lip-service in terms of what they are doing in Afghanistan. We need more combat forces there; we need greater flexibility; we need greater support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. As far as the police mission is concerned, the EU is doing a good job there, but it is doing nothing in comparison with the scale of the American effort. There should be proper coordination between what the Europeans and what the Americans are doing in terms of police training.\nFinally I should like to condemn the remarks that were made by Mr Brie when he talked about the Taliban and the Americans in the same breath: I think that was disgraceful. The Taliban are murdering their own people, the Allies are there supporting the local population.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I have just returned from Helmand and Kandahar.
