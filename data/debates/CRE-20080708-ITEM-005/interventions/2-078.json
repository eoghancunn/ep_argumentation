{"speaker": "Robert Evans (PSE). –", "english": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Mr President, I refer back to point 16 in the resolution where we say that ‘Afghanistan’s security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and that they therefore require more than a military solution’. This is the point that I think my colleagues Mr Rouček and Mr Pohjamo made earlier on. We know of many examples in history showing that military power can in many circumstances force an end to conflict and create a quasi-peaceful solution, but we also know from those historical lessons that only democratic institutions, with the support of the people of these countries, can secure a lasting solution.\nWe were making progress in this area in Afghanistan, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is right when she says that the Afghanistan Government must now show a clear respect for human rights and freedom of expression if this is to be restored. In the last elections I saw women voting in Afghanistan, which is a major step forward. These are the sort of things we have got to build on, and we must work with Pakistan so that we can restore peace in that area.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Mr President, I refer back to point 16 in the resolution where we say that ‘Afghanistan’s security problems are more complex than just a war on terror and that they therefore require more than a military solution’.
