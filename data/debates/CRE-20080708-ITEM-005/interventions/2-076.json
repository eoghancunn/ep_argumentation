{"speaker": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). – Mr President, we all remember why Afghanistan was invaded in the first place: it followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, masterminded by al-Qa’ida from bases in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban. The USA, along with its allies, most notably the UK, launched a successful attack to displace al-Qa’ida from its stronghold. The West’s serious military forces did what was needed to be done to confront terrorism.\nThis report states that the presence of NATO is essential in order to ensure the country’s future. It is true that only the combined military force of the free and democratic world united in NATO can defend our democratic freedoms from attack, but I am very dubious about the chances of grafting democracy onto a country that has no history of it, especially where the monopoly religious ideology is one that is antipathetic to the West’s view of liberal democracy.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). – Mr President, we all remember why Afghanistan was invaded in the first place: it followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the USA, masterminded by al-Qa’ida from bases in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban.
