        "1.  Welcomes the Commission approach taken in the Communication on the hazardous and harmful consumptionof alcohol and its harmful health consequences; calls, however, on the Commission,while not undermining the subsidiarity principle, to formulate ambitious general objectives for the Member States with a view to curbing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption; calls on the Member States to pay particular attention to vulnerable social groups, such as children, young people and pregnant women, and to address the problems of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by young people, workers and drivers by means of information and awareness-raising campaigns and, where appropriate, a review of compliance with existing national laws;\n",
        "2.  Acknowledges that alcohol consumption can be considered as a part of the European cultural heritage and life style; acknowledges that low alcohol consumption, i.e. 10 grams per day according to the WHO-Regional Office for Europe Action Plan on Alcohol 2000-2005 (PAEA), helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases and ischemia in some middle-aged individuals; recognises that whilemoderate consumers represent the majority of alcohol consumers, hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption isa significantminor behavioural pattern;\n",
        "3.  Points out that hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption occurs in all social groups and is caused by a wide variety of factors, making a comprehensive approach to combating this problem essential;\n",
        "4.  Acknowledges that interventions based on proper scientific evaluation are necessary if hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption is to be effectively reduced; considers that, since alcohol is one of the most significant health determinants, it is very important to collect data across the European Union and especially data on the correlation between levels of alcohol and road accidents, alcohol and liver diseases, and alcohol and neuropsychological disturbances, syndromes and diseases;therefore invites Member States and all stakeholders to increase resources dedicated to collection of data and  improving the efficiency of information, and to prevention campaigns and programmes;\n",
        "5.  Points out that the most urgent problems of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption are related to the effects of alcohol on young people, who are more vulnerable to physical and emotional suffering as well as to social harm from their own or other people's drinking;\n",
        "6.  Is worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among minors and young people and notes a worrying trend on their partto start drinking at an ever-earlier age and, given their greater willingness to take risks, to engage indangerous forms of behavioursuch as binge drinking, other forms of hazardous alcohol consumption which aim at drunkenness, mixedconsumption of alcohol and drugs, and driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs;\n",
        "7.  Stresses that young adolescents tend to increase their alcohol consumption when entering university life; considers that increased efforts at universities may contribute to lowering the number of heavy consumers of alcohol in the future; therefore calls on the Member States to intensify their prevention programmes in this area;\n",
        "8.  (i) Calls on the Commission to list and quantify the concrete harmful effects of alcohol consumption among young people in the Member States with a view to subsequently formulating European objectives for Member States aimed at curbing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by young people with Member States committing themselves to reducing these harmful effects at European level, taking into account the efforts already undertaken, (ii) Without prejudice to any obligations imposed by Community legislation, stresses that the Member States are free to determine the form of measures to be taken at national level, but that they should report to the Commission on the progress made in combating hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption among young people, (iii) Notes that the Commission has a supporting role to play in the achievement of the European objectives by helping the Member States to exchange knowledge and best practices and to carry out European research on combating the harmful effects of alcohol consumption by young people;\n",
        "9.Calls on the Commission and Member States,with the involvement of relevant non-governmental organisations and economic associations in the context of the Health and Alcohol Forum proposed by the Commission, to encourage the exchange of proven practices, in particular with a view to preventing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption among children and young people, andto adopt the following measures: (i) to launch education campaigns to be conducted by Member States and interest groupson the risks of hazardous and harmfulalcohol consumption, especially through school-based educational programmes directed towards children and adolescents, in particular by encouraging them to engage in regular sports activities, but also towards parents in order to prepare them to speak about alcohol-related problems within a family setting, and towards teachers; the idea of responsible and moderate consumption by adults should also be put across at an early stage, (ii) to limit the access to and availability of alcoholic drinks for young people, for instance by strictly implementing the existing legislation which prohibits selling alcohol to young people, by intensifying controls on sellers and distributors, such as restaurants and bars,supermarkets and retailers, (iii)to involve retailers and the catering industry in identifying and implementing concrete measures to prevent the selling and serving of alcohol and alcohol pops to minors, (iv) to particularly focus on such beverages as \"alcopops\", which are specifically targeted at young people, in order to ensure that their alcoholic nature can be clearly identified by consumers through measures such as stricter labelling requirements for such drinks, and requirements for clearer separation of alcopops from soft drinks in shops, and the selling to minors prohibited; also to promote higher taxes on such beverages, (v) to draw up guidelines, to be implemented at national level, setting an age limit for purchasing, selling and serving alcoholic drinks, (vi) to promote at European level blood alcohol content (BAC) limits as close as is workable to 0.00 % for new drivers,as already proposed by Parliament in its resolution of 18 January 2007 on the European Road Safety Action Programme - mid-term review[5],bearing in mind that some prepared foods may contain traces of alcohol, (vii) to provide more possibilities to know and verify the blood alcohol content also through the use of auto-calculation on the Internet and the widespread availability of breathanalysers, especially in discos, pubs and stadiums, and on motorways and roads in general, in particular during night hours, and to ensure that the message conveyed to the consumer is that drinking and driving are not compatible, (viii) to take any necessary measures to increase controls on drink-driving to the maximum, (ix) to strengthen thesanctions for drink-driving imposed by Member States, such as prolonged withdrawal of the driving licence and periods of confiscation of the vehicle, (x) to encourage Member States to ensure the availability of alternative public means of transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol, (xi) to encourage the extension of \"designated-driver programmes\" (\"who drives doesn't drink\") through educational means in view of their beneficial impact on road safety, while reminding passengers of the effects of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, (xii) to set up a European prize for the best campaign against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumptiondirected at schools and young people, (xiii) to intensify the exchange of best practice between Member States on how to work against hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption,and between national police forces on controls on drink-driving by young people , (xiv) to promote initiatives designed to guarantee psychological follow-up for individuals taken to hospital with acute alcohol intoxication;\n",

        "17. Calls on the Commission to promote initiatives aimed at exchanging best medical practices in a variety of healthcare settings as well as promoting independent and impartial information campaigns designed to raise awareness about the risks of hazardous and harmfulalcohol consumption; campaigns should also be directed towards people vulnerable to neuropsychological disturbances, syndromes and diseases and to people who are old, lonely, separated or isolated, as they are more exposed to seeking relief in alcohol consumption, thereby further damaging their condition and increasing their risk of suffering neuropsychological disturbances, syndromes and diseases;\n",
        "18. At the same time, asks the Commission to promote the spread of instruments such as the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification test) developed by the World Health Organisation, which allow the quick identification of people who are at risk even before they acknowledge having a problem with alcohol; points out that timely informal discussion between general practitioners and patients is one of the most efficient tools to inform patients about the risks linked to hazardous and harmful consumption of alcohol and to promote the necessary behavioural changes in problem drinkers; calls on Member States to support the qualification of doctors (GPs) on alcohol problems and disorders and adequate interventions;\n",
