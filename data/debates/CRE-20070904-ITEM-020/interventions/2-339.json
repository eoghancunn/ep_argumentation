{"speaker": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). –", "english": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this important report.\nI wish to draw attention to the role that alcohol plays in the incidence of suicide, with studies showing that over 20% of persons committing suicide used alcohol prior to death. Indeed, when the legal age for drinking alcohol was raised from 18 to 21 in the US, the most notable impact was on the reduction of accidents in the home, at work and on the roads, but there was also a 7% reduction in suicides.\nThere are many excellent suggestions in this report that I support. However, I have one slight reservation concerning the part of recital K which states: ‘whereas measures should also be taken to prevent the consumption of alcohol by minors and pregnant women’. I know there are major issues with regard to foetal alcohol syndrome, and I am in favour of information labels, warning labels, curbs on advertising and pre- and post-natal support, but the suggestion that we should prevent pregnant women from taking a drink is a step too far. We are not in the business of prohibition – that does not work – but we need what is proposed in this report, and much more.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this important report.\nI wish to draw attention to the role that alcohol plays in the incidence of suicide, with studies showing that over 20% of persons committing suicide used alcohol prior to death.
