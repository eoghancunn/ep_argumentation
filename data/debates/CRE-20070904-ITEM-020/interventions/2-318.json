{"speaker": "Markos Kyprianou,", "english": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent work and the very good report that he has produced, and also the other members of the committee who have supported him and worked with him in producing such an interesting, useful and positive report.\nI do not want to repeat much of what has been included in the communication or in the report, and I begin by saying that I am very happy that we see eye to eye as to how we can solve and deal with such a difficult and important problem. We know the statistics, which are worrying. Almost 200 000 people a year in the European Union die of diseases related to excessive alcohol consumption. We have 43-45 million people who drink at hazardous levels in the European Union which amounts to 70.4% of all ill health and early deaths, and this is one of the largest causes of death among young people. So the statistics are worrying, but we have to emphasise from the outset that we are not dealing with alcohol as a product on its own: it is the excessive consumption and the abuse of alcohol that are creating these problems. Sometimes it makes it more difficult to educate and teach people how to consume, in moderate and more responsible ways, a product which has been around for centuries; it is the excess or the abuse that is causing the problems.\nI am very happy that Parliament agrees with the need for a European strategy and for European action in this respect. It is true that we have to complement the policy of the Member States, as is stated in Article 152, but that does not mean that we do nothing. On the contrary, we are there to support, complement and add to the actions taken by the Member States. It is also true that we have different cultures and different traditions in the Member States but, unfortunately, we now see the problems that until recently existed only in some Member States spreading everywhere in the European Union. Unfortunately, bad habits travel fast and are very easily copied, especially by young people.\nThe possibility exists to exchange best practice through cooperation and working together, before it is too late. We can take action before the problem gets out of hand, and this is one of the most important aspects of this strategy.\nWe should focus on young people. Binge drinking is now a main concern regarding young people, but drink-driving is also one of the highest causes of deaths among young people.\nAt the same time, it is extremely important to focus on the priorities, and I am glad that the report agrees with the Commission on the main priorities, as I said, especially regarding young people, but also pregnant women. Unfortunately, it is still a problem in the European Union that we still have children born with problems because of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. One would have expected, in this day and age, with the highest level of education in the European Union, this would not happen, but unfortunately it does.\nI have noted with great interest the reference made in the report to the problem among elderly people. This will be seriously taken into consideration for the next actions because I can see that this can also be a serious social and health problem.\nThe European Union as a whole will work on two levels. Firstly, there is the Committee on National Policy and Action, where the Member States are represented, and this will coordinate national alcohol policies and develop further policies, especially those identified in the communication.\nBut, at the same time, we also have the European Alcohol and Health Forum, where all the stakeholders are present and there we will develop concrete actions at the appropriate levels. However, it will not be a debating society or just a ‘talk show’. On the contrary, we are asking for firm commitments which will not only have to produce specific results but also will have to be made public and closely monitored, and the results of the monitoring will also be made public. We are optimistic that this will be able to deal with some complicated issues, for example responsible marketing, responsible advertising – as identified in the report – and, at the same time, other aspects, like responsible serving, because it is not just the producers but also the retailers who have a serious responsibility in this area, and we will focus on this as well.\nMost of the issues raised in the report confirm the policy orientations set out in the strategy outlined in the Commission’s communication. Some points strive to further develop this strategy and, of course, I will pay close attention to these; other points go beyond the recommendations of the Commission’s communication on some issues, such as labelling and taxation. We will reflect on these issues as well.\nConcerning the warning labels on alcoholic drinks, which I know has been an issue of great debate both when the communication was being drafted and in Parliament as well, we will study the experience obtained by Member States which are already in the process of introducing them and we will explore the possibility, in cooperation with the Member States, of developing official common approaches throughout the Community regarding this issue. We have evidence that warning labels raise awareness – and that is why Member States introduced them – but, at the same time, they have to be part of a broader strategy; on their own, they cannot achieve the goals we wish for. Therefore, we need campaigns for raising awareness of education programmes. For example, we can put warning labels on bottles, but what happens to drinks served in restaurants, bars and homes where the consumer does not see the bottle and, therefore, does not see the label? So we have to come up with new ideas, for example leaflets accompanying purchases of alcoholic beverages and advice from doctors, as was mentioned in the report. These are important aspects. Responsible communication, responsible sales and responsible marketing are also important aspects, and we have what is provided in the audiovisual services legislation. However, through the forum, we can develop a code of conduct to be complied with by all stakeholders.\nI should like to finish by saying that addressing alcoholic-related harm is a difficult challenge, precisely because we have to deal with one particular aspect, the excessive consumption and not the product itself. However, I believe we are moving in the right direction, before the problem becomes unmanageable.\nSo I am looking forward to achieving concrete results, in the bodies I mentioned earlier, but, most importantly, in close cooperation with Parliament, and I am looking forward to your support in this continuous effort.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Markos Kyprianou, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent work and the very good report that he has produced, and also the other members of the committee who have supported him and worked with him in producing such an interesting, useful and positive report.\nI do not want to repeat much of what has been included in the communication or in the report, and I begin by saying that I am very happy that we see eye to eye as to how we can solve and deal with such a difficult and important problem.
