{"speaker": "David Martin (PSE),", "english": "David Martin (PSE), in writing . – It is a worrying trend that in recent years alcohol manufacturers are targeting under-age drinkers with products such as ‘alcopops’. Binge drinking is increasing amongst young people and it is important that we tackle this development effectively. I believe that a good way to do this is to encourage supermarkets and shops to better separate alcopops from soft drinks. Alcopops, along with other alcohol drinks, should also carry adequate health warnings. I am pleased that my amendments along these lines were incorporated into the report. Of course, to tackle under-age and binge drinking effectively, national governments must also focus on the consumer through changing attitudes towards alcohol. I therefore welcome the focus on information and awareness-raising campaigns such as through school-based educational programmes. I also support the recommendations that the limit for blood alcohol content (BAC) should be set as close to 0.00% as possible, especially for new drivers. I believe that the widespread availability of breath analysers, suggested in the report, can help to deter potential drink drivers. National governments can do more to ensure the availability of public transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol.", "lang": "EN", "original": "David Martin (PSE), in writing . – It is a worrying trend that in recent years alcohol manufacturers are targeting under-age drinkers with products such as ‘alcopops’.
