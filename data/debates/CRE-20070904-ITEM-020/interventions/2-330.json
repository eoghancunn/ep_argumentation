{"speaker": "Bairbre de Brún (GUE/NGL).", "english": "Bairbre de Brún (GUE/NGL). – (GA) Mr President, I should like to support the call in the report for society to address the problems of alcohol abuse. The social and economic impact of alcohol abuse on Ireland as a whole is almost incalculable. We should also look at good practice in other EU countries, for we could devise a much better long-term policy to tackle alcohol-related harm. The signs of alcohol abuse are discernible in the indiscriminate violence on the streets and in domestic violence.\nThere should be interpreting!\n(The speaker continues in English.)\nPeople knew I was coming tonight, people knew I was speaking at this time, people know that my language is now a working language of the European Union. I gave proper notice. I would like there to be interpreting. I will be very unhappy if there is no interpreting for what I wish to say tonight.\n(The speaker reverts to Irish.)\n(GA) We need to exercise scrutiny. We have to deal with the matter of alcopops and the use of special offers and other marketing ploys designed to increase alcoholic drink sales among young people in particular. It would also be a good thing to put a warning on labels aimed especially at pregnant women. The sale of alcohol needs to be monitored more closely.\n(The speaker repeats her comments in English.)\nWe need, certainly, a special focus on alcohol-related harm in young people. We need more stringent monitoring of the laws on selling alcohol to under-age children. We need to address the question of alcohol, alcopops, the use of special offers and other marketing devices designed to increase the sales of alcoholic drinks among young people in particular, looking at the availability of public transport at night, the encouragement of designator-driver programmes, and it would also be good to have labelling on alcoholic drinks specifically designed and directed towards women who are pregnant.\n(The speaker reverts to Irish.)\n(GA) I am most annoyed that interpreting is not available!\n(The speaker continues in English.)\nI am very unhappy that there was no interpreting here. I have played fair with Parliament since my language became an official and working language and I had hoped that it would also play fair with me.\n(Applause)", "lang": "GA", "original": "Bairbre de Brún (GUE/NGL). – (GA) Mr President, I should like to support the call in the report for society to address the problems of alcohol abuse.
