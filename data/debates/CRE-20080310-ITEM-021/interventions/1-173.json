Along with amending Budget No 1/2008, we also proposed the allocation of EUR 162 million from the solidarity fund for the UK in order to compensate for the serious damage caused by last summer’s floods.\nAs the chairman of Committee on Budgets has already said, we have recently received requests from two Member States – Greece and Slovenia – and we will probably be presenting a new proposal very soon. Of course, this proposal is not only about the solidarity fund. It is only the solidarity fund that will have financial implications: other elements of the proposal are more technical.\nThe Galileo question, of course, is very sensitive to all of us and I fully understand the concerns of the Committee on Budgets. However, I must say that the proposal of the Committee on Budgets to change the Commission proposal will delay delivery of the solidarity fund by about one month because it will have to go back to Council for another vote, but we understand the sensitivity and we cannot argue with the decision of the Committee on Budgets on this matter. However, I very much hope that our proposal in general will be supported this week in Parliament.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, on 18 January the Commission adopted the proposal for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund for the United Kingdom, and we are happy and satisfied that the Committee on Budgets’ opinion is quite positive towards our proposal.
