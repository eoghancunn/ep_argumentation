{"speaker": "Richard James Ashworth,", "english": "Richard James Ashworth, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I would like to say that I support this amending budget, and there are one or two items which I would like to comment upon.\nFirstly concerning the Solidarity Fund: this, of course, was the allocation in respect of the floods in Britain in June and July last year. Much of this flooding happened in my region, and I can testify to the appalling damage and hardship which it brought on many residents of my area. I was interested – but not surprised – to note that this was the third largest claim in the history of the solidarity fund, the claim being EUR 4.6 billion and the allocation being to the sum of EUR 162.8 million. I am aware that my friend and colleague Reimer Böge said that, of course, in the grand order of things it is not a great deal of money. Perhaps it is not, but as a gesture of solidarity, please believe me that it is well and truly appreciated, and on behalf of the people of that region, I want to express my thanks: firstly to the members of the Budget Committee, who were unanimous in their support of this aid package – which is truly a gesture of solidarity. But may I also express my appreciation to the Commissioner and her colleagues who turned this claim around in seven months. I thought that was a remarkable achievement, Commissioner, and I thank you for your efforts to do that. I shall, of course, watch with interest over the next weeks and months to see how the United Kingdom Government disburses those funds, but it is clear to me that, with the increasing evidence of extreme climatic events, these issues are going to occur with a greater regularity throughout the European Union, and it is clear that, when expressing solidarity, it is in fact speed of response that is the most important element in that mechanism.\nOn the issue of Frontex, I also wanted to say that I support the additional funding for Frontex – we doubled the funding for the Agency. I thought that was exactly right, and I note that this request is for the creation of 25 posts. But I do believe that it is important that we continue to monitor the distribution of funding, to ensure that it delivers value for money. In the same way, I supported thoroughly the Lisbon objectives which the Commission set for themselves, particularly in the field of research and development. I therefore recognise the need for the research executive agencies; but again, I express my anxiety at the proliferation of agencies which, I have to say, historically have not been renowned for their effective delivery of value for money.\nFinally, on the subject of Galileo: this new budget line will do a great deal to give greater transparency and accountability. However, I do agree with my colleagues on the Budget Committee when we say that we will proceed with caution. If I may say so, Madam Commissioner, this is a massive undertaking, and – borrowing some space age jargon – may I say that the Commission here is ‘boldly going where no Commission has ever gone before’. I therefore agree with my colleague Reimer Böge when he says that we support this, but we would insist on inserting the PM line.\nMr President, I support the amending budget and am happy to do so.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard James Ashworth, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I would like to say that I support this amending budget, and there are one or two items which I would like to comment upon.\nFirstly concerning the Solidarity Fund: this, of course, was the allocation in respect of the floods in Britain in June and July last year.
