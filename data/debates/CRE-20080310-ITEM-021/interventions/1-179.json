{"speaker": "John Whittaker,", "english": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, I am pleased to know that Britain should receive money to help us with the cost of last year’s floods. We are all very happy that the EU has generously come to the aid of a Member State in difficulty. But it is not quite like that: first, the grant is only 3.5% of the cost of the damage – a gesture, as Mr Ashworth says – and, secondly, it is nine months after the event – and that is fast, they say! It would have been more helpful if we had known it would be forthcoming, and then reconstruction could have been planned accordingly. If there is one thing that gets up the nose of the British – when we realise that we are getting back a little of the cash we have paid into the European Union – is that we are obliged to beg for it and then advertise the EU’s generosity. Please, can we not rather keep our own money and then decide how to spend it ourselves? That way, it could be paid out more quickly.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, I am pleased to know that Britain should receive money to help us with the cost of last year’s floods.
