Putting into practice the so-called ‘weighted’ voting procedure would give an advantage to the bigger Member States, to the detriment of the smaller ones.

The majority of national energy market regulators also favoured the launch of an agency that would be more than just another bureaucratic debating club with no powers. Applying unequal conditions to the individual countries would basically devalue the effort to create a respected and functioning agency. Different national energy markets came into being under different circumstances and still have not been efficiently linked up.
