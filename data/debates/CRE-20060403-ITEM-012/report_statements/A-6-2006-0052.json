    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament in 2006, on the basis of Article 255 TEC, a legislative proposal on 'the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and general principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of access', which should be prepared in inter-institutional discussions and follow the detailed recommendations set out below;\n",
        "2.  Confirms that the recommendations below respect the principle of subsidiarity, the fundamental rights of citizens, the case-law of the ECHR, particularly that on Article 8, and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights;\n",
        "3. Considers that the financial implications of the requested proposal must be covered bythe institutions' operating budgets as the rules on transparency are indissociable from those relating to the establishment, adoption and publication of texts of which they are the authors or which are addressed to them;\n",
        "4. Stresses that any new rules on access to documents should apply as from the date of the amended Regulation's entry into force and should, therefore, have no retroactive effects;\n",
        "5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States and accession and candidate countries.\n"
