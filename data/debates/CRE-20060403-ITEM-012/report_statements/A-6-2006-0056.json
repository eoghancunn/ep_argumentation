        "1.Εndorses the European Ombudsman's recommendation to the Council;\n",
        "2.Recalls that\n",
        "3.Recalls that, given the definition of legislative activity contained in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the Council’s Rules of Procedure, the principle of transparency should as a matter of urgency be made to apply not only to Council deliberations with Parliament under the codecision procedure but also to every other case where Parliament is involved, including straightforward consultation, and wherever it adopts acts which may affect individual rights and freedoms, as is the case with acts falling under the third pillar; 4       Regrets the absence of progress in these areas and the Council’s own silence on the matter in its Conclusions of 22 December 2005;\n",
        "5.Considers it unacceptable that the EU's most important law-making body still meets behind closed doors when acting as legislator;\n",
        "6.Points out that the principles of multi-level governance in the EU are the principles of good governance: participation, transparency, accountability, efficiency and cohesion;\n",
        "7.Is of the opinion that, at a time when the EU sees itself as a promoter of democratisation and accountability, the Council should respond to the calls for greater transparency coming from parliaments, civil society and the general public;\n",
        "8.      Believes that it is not only a matter of principle that legislative bodies should meet in public, but that it is also of direct relevance to the efforts of the European Parliament and national parliaments, as the directly elected representatives of European citizens, to fulfil their scrutiny role;   9.   Considers that it is of the utmost importance for national parliaments to be able to hold their governments and ministers to account; is of the opinion that this cannot be done effectively if it is unclear how ministers have acted and voted in the Council and on what information their decisions were based;\n",
        "10.    Believes that the recent developments in connection with the debate surrounding the ratification process of the Constitutional Treaty have illustrated clearly that European citizens want the European decision-making process to be more open;\n",
        "11.    Believes that meeting in public would make the Council's work both more transparent and more relevant to European citizens and would increase the public's confidence in the way the European Union and its representatives work;\n",
        "12.    Is convinced that greater openness will lead to the ministers of Member State governments shouldering greater collective responsibility, and that it will enhance the legitimacy of the Council's decisions in the eyes of the public and also promote and intensify public discussion on European matters;\n",
        "13.    Calls on the Council further to amend its Rules of Procedure and change its working methods so that the meetings in which it acts in its legislative capacity are open and accessible to the public;\n",
        "14.Considers that meetings of COREPER are an essential part of the legislative deliberations of the Council and that, therefore, they should be covered by the rules on openness; considers that the Council should take its decisions by formal vote and not only by approval;\n",
        "15.Recalls that the Council is also acting in its legislative capacity when participating in conciliation procedures;\n",
        "16.Notes that, at present, preparatory documents for items on Council meeting agendas are not accessible to the public; stresses that, in any adapted Rules of Procedure, the Council should clearly specify the classification and hierarchy of such documents and make them accessible to the public;\n",
        "17.Welcomes the Council Conclusions of 22 December 2005 as a step in the right direction, but regrets that the Council did not follow the Ombudsman's recommendation to amend its Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "18.Recalls that an amendment of the Council's Rules of Procedure requires the support of thirteen of the twenty-five Member States;\n",
        "19.Considers that, since all Member State governments have signed the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, agreement on an amendment of the Council's Rules of Procedure should not meet with opposition, as the principle has already been politically accepted by all Member State governments;\n",
        "20.Stresses that the European Parliament has fully endorsed the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the efforts to bring it into force; stresses that an amendment of the Council's Rules of Procedure should not be seen as a substitute for all or parts of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe but as a long overdue adaptation to European reality and institutional equality in law-making in the European Union;\n",
        "21.    Calls on the Council to take all measures needed to make the meetings in which it is acting in its legislative capacity open and accessible to the public; requests the Council also to broadcast, including on the internet, its public meetings and to provide the dates and agendas of those meetings in good time and issue official transcripts thereof in all official languages of the European Union;22.  Urges the Council to adopt a common approach regarding the implementation of the European Union Code of Good Administrative Behaviour adopted by the European Parliament;\n",
        "23.    Suggests to the Council the launch of a pilot project on \"more transparent decision making\", wherein one or more topical legislative issues would be discussed in a fully open and accessible Council meeting, with special emphasis being laid on explaining the procedures followed and decisions made, so that they would be easier for citizens to understand;\n",
        "24.    Calls on the Presidency, the members of the Council and the Commission to propose issues or subjects for such an open debate under Article 8(3) of Council's Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "25.    Calls on the Presidency-in-Office of Council as a matter of priority to put the issue of opening Council meetings to the public on the agenda of the European Council and to make a solemn commitment on 9 May 2006 to immediately amend the Council’s Rules of Procedure and to review Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, in agreement with the European Parliament, by the end of 2006;\n",
        "26.    Calls on all interested parties to bring maximum pressure to bear on the Council in order to persuade it to follow the Ombudsman's recommendation and adapt its Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "27.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
