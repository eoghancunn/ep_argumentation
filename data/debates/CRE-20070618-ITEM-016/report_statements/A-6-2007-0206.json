        "2.  Underlines that EU-Russia relations are at a critical stage; therefore, calls for constructive and results-oriented engagement between both Russia and EU, but not at anycost;points out that the European Union shares with Russia not only economic and trade interests and a commitment todemocracy, human rights and the rule of law,but also an objective to act in the international arena and in the common neighbourhood; regrets, however, that the EU and Russia have not succeeded in overcoming the lack of trust between them;\n",
        "3.  Considers that the common membership of Russia and the EU Member States of the Council of Europe underpins their shared values and commitment to its aims, as laid down in its statute and conventions: to extend and protect human rights, promote democracy and uphold the rule of law in the whole of Europe; encourages both the Member States and Russia to actively participate in the Council of Europe as it is a platform for the practical realisation of those aims; notes the high number of cases brought against Russia before the European Court of Human Rights; emphasises the latter’s role in enforcing the obligations of Council of Europe Member States;\n",
        "4.  Notes that the Russian Federation has created a generally positive macroeconomic environment which has contributed to impressive economic growth following the crisis in 1998; recalls that this growth has been mainly determined by the high rise in  world energy prices;\n",
        "5.  Acknowledges the economic and other related political reforms, namely in the tax system, the system of fiscal federalism, public administration and regulation of the financial system that have been implemented in Russia during recent years; is nonetheless convinced that further structural reforms,  namely in health care, education, the gas sector, the banking system and more generally in the area of the enforcement of the rule of law, are necessary and calls on the Russian Federation to pursue its reforms, which will be beneficial both to Russians and to Europeans alike and will make it possible to enhance the Russian Federation's attractiveness in the eyes of  international and ,in particular, European investors, thus having a considerable impact on economic growth while at the same time allowing the Russian Federation to benefit from foreign know-how; stresses that any further legislative reform must be carried out in accordance with international standards;\n",

        "12. Stresses that increased economic contacts will necessitate more ambitious visa facilitation also covering ordinary bona fide travellers not belonging to any pre-set categories, and liberalisation in the long term;\n",
        "13. Emphasises the importance, also to the EU, of Russia's accession to the WTO and its implications for trade liberalisation as well as for its commitment to adhere to its  rules, and is convinced that WTO membership will send an important signal to foreign and Russian investors, drive economic growth in Russia and enhance trade exchanges with the EU; urges the Russian Federation to not only work towards concluding the outstanding WTO bilateral Market Access Agreements, but also to fulfil and implement its commitments pursuant to the agreements it has already signed, such as the agreement with the EC;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Russian Federation, in the context of its forthcoming accession to the WTO, to resolve the problems of tariffs on timber exports to the Scandinavian countries and also to settle the issues relating to rail fares fixed according to destination, particularly those to the Baltic countries, which have been ruled to be discriminatory;\n",
        "15. Believes that WTO accession should lead to deeper economic integration between the EU and Russia, within the framework of the CES; calls on the Commission to consider the negotiation of a possible Free Trade Agreement (FTA) following Russia's accession to the WTO;\n",

        "18. Believes that the EU should, if the negotiations with Russia on a new PCA fail to produce tangible results, consider an alternative approach based on reinvigorating the ongoing work on the agreed roadmaps in the four common spaces, and on elaborating a joint approach for political cooperation;\n",
        "19. Emphasises that progress in the common space of freedom, security and justice, the space of  co-operation in the field of external security and the space of research and education, including cultural aspects, would have a significant economic impact; stresses the need  for the Russian government to increase its efforts in that field;\n",
        "20. Stresses the need for the Russian Federation to perfect its  policy  as regards the protection of foreign investment in accordance with internationally recognised OECD standards, which would permit  the European Union to conduct negotiations on the conclusion of agreements on the protection and promotion of investment;\n",
        "21. Stresses the importance of improving the investment climate in Russia; believes that this can only be achieved by promoting and facilitating non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable business conditions rooted in strong democratic values; in addition, stresses that debureaucratisation and the promotion of two-way investments are needed;\n",
        "22. Takes note of the bill recently introduced in the Russian Federation, which allows the government to reject foreign bids for majority stakes in Russian companies, thus prohibiting foreign ownership of more than 49% in companies active in 39 strategic industries; questions the bill itself as well as the choice and the growing number of industries that have been classified as strategic and essential to national security; considers that this does not represent a move towards improving the investment climate and that this raises fundamental questions regarding the role of the State in a market economy and competition in key sectors of the economy;  considers that the ownership situation of companies, in Russia as in other countries, is a matter which can best be determined by the market;\n",
        "23. Stresses that the establishment and operation of companies should be facilitated on a reciprocal basis; notes that the EU is open to investment from Russia, as is indicated by the rise in Russian businesses present in the EU, notably in the energy and steel sectors; calls, therefore, for foreign companies operating in the natural resource sectors in Russia to be granted the same degree of access;\n",
        "24. Notes that, in Russia, state trading continues to be successful in certain areas of the economy;\n",
        "25. Takes note of the introduction of so-called Special Economic Zones, which offer special incentives for investment, a development which could prove advantageous for European businesses; encourages the Russian Federation to guarantee decent working conditions and respect for the trade union rights of workers in these zones; calls for strict observance and independent monitoring of human rights, and social and environmental standards in those Special Economic Zones;\n",

        "28. Notes that the Commission has applied anti-dumping measures in relation to Russian exports of ammonium nitrate, potassium chloride, a number of steel products, silicon and urea products; urges Russian companies to export to the EU under fair trade conditions and to provide Community investigators examining cases of dumping with the necessary information in order to allow EU enforcement authorities to quickly terminate anti-dumping measures that have been applied;\n",

        "30. Notes, with regret, that Russia is exploiting commercial policy instruments for foreign policy ends in a manner incompatible with WTO rules;\n",
        "31. Draws attention to the unjustified ban on meat imports from Poland, which has now been in place for two years, and recommends that this problem, the existence of which is incompatible with WTO rules, be resolved as soon as possible;\n",
        "32. Stresses the need for improvements in legislation and law enforcement to be made as regards the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights, in order to increase competitiveness and make the investment climate more attractive by approximating regulatory systems with the highest international standards and norms; urges the Russian authorities, ahead of its forthcoming membership of the WTO, to align Part IV of its Civil Code on Intellectual Property Rights to WTO rules and international agreements, particularly the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS), and to ensure full implementation, so that counterfeiting and piracy can be effectively combated;\n",

        "35. Encourages the Russian authorities to take all necessary and effective measures to uncover the sources of illegal activity and to render production plants or internet-based operators inoperable; notes that, as regards  production plants, those measures should include repeated and unannounced inspections of known plants with the cooperation of rights holders, and  strengthening the licensing regime as regards optical media plants; stresses that, for  internet-based operators, those measures should cover the enactment of legislative amendments whichprovide that collecting societies may only act on behalf of rights holders that explicitly authorise such action and the enactment of provisions to implement the Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996;\n",
        "36. Reiterates the need for a coherent European energy policy; stresses that bilateral agreements between EU Member States and Russia should, if absolutely necessary, help in the pursuit of the EU’s overall energy security interests;\n",

        "38. Urges both the EU and Russia to cooperate more closely with one another and with all the social partnerswithin the framework of the EU-Russia Energy dialogue, with particular emphasis being placed on addressing issues relating to the sustainability and continued reliability of the production, transportation and use of energy, energy efficiency and security of supply; urges the EU, in close cooperation with the Russian Federation, to promote investment in renewables  and to encourage the sharing of technology and regulatory convergence with a view to establishing a sustainable relationship benefiting both parties; also calls on the Russian Federation to offer fair and non-discriminatory treatment to all its partners, to facilitate access to the Russian market by European investors and to give due consideration to environmental protection;\n",
        "39. Supports the German Presidency in its aim to ensure a secure supply of energy and reduce energy dependency by means of cooperation and further dialogue on energy with Russia, thus putting the energy partnership policy on a solid and reliable footing, as well as by aiming to diversify sources of energy by introducing binding targets for energy efficiency and for the use of renewable and alternative energies;  notes that the development of such a strategy is of common interest to the EU and Russia and that it is hazardous for the EU to become too dependent on natural gas;\n",
        "40. Welcomes the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Russian Federation in October 2004; calls on the EU and the Russian Federation to cooperate closely with a view to promoting technical innovation and improving efficiency in the energy sector, and to consider jointly future strategies to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for the period following the expiry of the Protocol in 2012;\n",
        "41. Is convinced that the sole means of achieving a formal agreement on energy, ratified by Russia, is to negotiate a new framework document, i.e. in the context of the new PCA; suggests that elements of the European Energy Charter Treaty could be transposed in a new document, as the current situation, characterised by a lack of formal agreement, is unacceptable;\n",
