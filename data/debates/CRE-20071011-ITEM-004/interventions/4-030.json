The original proposal to tag both passengers’ baggage and the boarding pass of each passenger to me poses a significant breach, or potential breach, of civil liberties. I can see little benefit in being able to tag passengers’ movement around airport terminals and would also call into question how much it would cost for airports to implement such measures.\nThere are clear benefits in being able to quickly identify where certain pieces of baggage or luggage are at any point in time with radio frequency identifiers, and this is where I draw the line. My amendment to restrict the tagging of baggage, which was adopted in both the Civil Liberties Committee and the Committee on Transport, to me strikes the right balance between being able to reduce delays to flights and to respect the personal freedoms of passengers as they circulate through airports and terminal buildings. With this in mind, I can therefore fully support the text before us today.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bradbourn (PPE-DE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs . – Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have only one point to make in this debate, and that is in regard to the Commission proposal on radio identification tagging.
