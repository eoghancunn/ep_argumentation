{"speaker": "John Purvis (PPE-DE),", "english": "John Purvis (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . – Madam President, advances in the aviation industry have contributed massively to economic progress and general well-being, and they can continue to do so. This industry does not deserve the environmentalist hostility which is often heaped upon it. This attitude is also politically unwise, as all our constituents benefit enormously in both their work and their leisure. Aviation has done much to meet its environmental obligations by developing and adopting new technology and improving operational efficiencies. It rests with the political authorities and the administrative and regulatory authorities to play their part in permitting and enthusiastically encouraging continuing improvement.\nMs Jensen’s excellent report incorporates much of what my committee proposed. But there are three matters which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs put forward in its opinion and which did not find their way into the final report.\nFirstly, with the advent of quieter aircraft, it should be possible to relax limitations on airport opening times and move towards 24-hour operation almost everywhere. This would greatly enhance capital and capacity utilisation of airport infrastructures and of the aircraft themselves, facilitating better productivity and cheaper services with less than proportionate environmental impact.\nSecondly, the selection of efficient ground handlers can also enhance productivity by improving utilisation of airport infrastructure, notably where they speed up aircraft turnarounds and contribute to good timekeeping and passenger satisfaction.\nThirdly, we advocated applying market forces by the open auctioning of airport slots, moving away from grandfather rights while retaining a defined proportion of slots at hub airports for those vital regional feeder services.\nThose bodies responsible for providing the environment in which airlines operate must facilitate greater productivity by providing adequate and efficient infrastructure and imposing only appropriate regulatory conditions.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Purvis (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . – Madam President, advances in the aviation industry have contributed massively to economic progress and general well-being, and they can continue to do so.
