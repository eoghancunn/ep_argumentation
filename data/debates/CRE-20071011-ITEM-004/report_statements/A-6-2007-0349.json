    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the abovementioned Commission communication as a  first step in addressing the issue of airport capacity, although the planning of new infrastructure remains within the competence of the Member States; calls at the same time on the Commission to accord air transport the attention it deserves as a central element of goods and passenger transport in Europe;   further calls on the Commission to monitor, and present precise statistics relating to, the current situation in order to better tackle the problem of capacity;\n",
        "2.  Notes that adequate airport capacity and efficient groundhandling and use of capacity are vital to the European economy and must be ensured;\n",
        "3.   Welcomes the Commission's proposals and stresses the importance of air transport in ensuring territorial, economic and social cohesion in the Union, in particular with regard to remote, peripheral and island regions;\n",
        "4.  Considers that the 14 measures suggested by the Commission in its Communication represent a consistent approach for improving the use of current capacities; nevertheless requests the Commission to set more concrete deadlines for their implementation and insists on those deadlines being respected; Building new capacities\n",
        "5.   Considers, however, that the Commission has not yet fully investigated the possibility of a global EU approach as regards the need for extra capacity, the constraints on future investments in additional capacity and the strategic axes that would not only allow the risks of a capacity crunch to be anticipated but also ensure that the EU becomes a cohesive and competitive air transport platform at global level;\n",
        "6.  Proposes to introduce a survey of actual demand for infrastructure, which would  improve any futurecomprehensive European airport capacity plan and could become an accepted EU-wide air transport forecasting mechanism; highlights that such a mechanism could be used by airports as a planning framework for capacity improvement and thatthe advantage of a demand-based forecast is that it provides a realistic market picture for the development of air transport;\n",
        "7.  Notes that one of the biggest barriers to the liberalisation of groundhandling services and efficiency, as alluded to by many of the Community's airports, is a lack of space, but considers that such a contention needs to be  verified and, where necessary, resolved;\n",
        "8.  Stresses the need to develop common definitions and common analytical tools for airport capacity assessments as well as procedures for the involvement of all stakeholders in the mid-and long-term airport capacity needs of the EU; notes that this collaborative approach could be accompanied by an exchange of good practice on topics such as environmental impact and cost efficiency, pre-financing of new infrastructures, land use planning/management, integration of all transport modes, as well as modelling/simulation tools with a view to speeding-up the planning and building of new capacities; emphasises that these initiatives would serve to complement the SESAR programme and could be supplemented with new institutional tools that will help to increase airport capacity;\n",
        "9.  Requests the Commission to report to Parliament before 2009 ona master plan for enhanced airport capacityin Europe; stresses that such a report should lay down a cohesive approach for Member States in order to promote and coordinate any national and cross-border initiative for building new airport capacities dedicated to international trafficand make better use of existing capacities, as well for managing secondary airport capacity, without prejudice to Member States' and Community competences to allocate airport capacities; stresses that the hubs and  the regional airports, through point-to-point journeys, can each in their own way and according to specific constraints of the various Member States respond to the environmental problems, to congestion problems and challenges facing accessibility, and that only the cohabitation of various airport models according to national specificities will enable the EU to fulfil its needs in this field; recalls in this respect that the accessibility to  airports is of great importance and that their successful integration in the transport network is an essential condition for  co modality.\n",
        "10. Calls on the Member States and the regional and local authorities to ensure that airports, regardless of their governing bodies, are included in regional spatial development plans or taken into account in regional development strategies; points out that the extension and construction of major infrastructure, such as airports,must be subject to a territorial impact assessment;\n",
        "11. Supports the Commission in its ambition to increase the internal logistical efficiency of airports but suggests that this should be limited to the tracking of baggage and cargo only;\n",
        "12. Believes that, in order to increase capacity, pre-financing infrastructure development is a valid option for airports; highlights that this financing scheme benefits both the airlines and the airports by lowering overall financing costs of infrastructure, ensuring a smoother profile of prices for airlines and reducing the risk for airports as airlines begin to repay their investments earlier;\n",
        "13. Stresses the economic importance of airports for job creation, particularly at regional level; points out that European airport operators, airlines, maintenance firms and caterers are in a position to create a significant number of jobs, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Member States and regional and local authorities to take account of environmental factors when deciding where to locate airports, including noise, emissions, road traffic density in the vicinity of the airport, the proximity of fuel tanks, etc., and of meteorological factors; Promoting environmentally-friendly growth\n",
        "15. Notes that the improved performance of aviation engines has reduced their CO2emissions by 70% per km in the last 40 years and that further  reductions in emissions will continue in the future, stresses that the objective of the industry is to cut emissions by a further 50% by 2020;\n",
        "16. Points out, nevertheless, that, despite this progress, the growth in air traffic, which has increased substantially in recent years, has resulted in a sharp increase in the total volume of greenhouse gas emissions produced by this sector (+100 % compared to 1990, according to estimates by the European Environment Agency), and that airport congestion is contributing significantly to this;\n",
        "17. Recalls that the growth of air transport will have to be accompanied by technical and regulatory schemes limiting the external costs of this mode; welcomes, to this effect, the Commission initiative to incorporate aviation in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); points out that the efficiency of measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of air transport also depends on the policies pursued by countries at global level and, with this in view, stresses the need to establish joint programmes with third countries;\n",
        "18. Considers, however, that the issue of greenhouse gas emissions should, wherever possible, be tackled with more vigour at both European and international levels with a view to improving the competitiveness of a more sustainable EU air transport sector which is already threatened by the rapid development of major hubs in neighbouring non-EU regions of Europe;  calls on the Commission and the Member States to use all available means to reach an agreement on this issue at international level;\n",
        "19. Particularly insists on the need to develop regulatory and financial schemes in order to encourage the retrofitting and renewal of fleets and promote the environmental performance of engines, the corollary of which is to render them quieter, more energy-efficient and less polluting; Ensuring the correct implementation and adaptation of the regulatory framework\n",
        "20. Considers that the increase in air traffic will require a fuller implementation of the legal framework applicable to air transport;\n",
        "21. Requests the Commission to check the full implementation of Regulation 95/93, as amended by Regulation No 793/2004, on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports[2]and to provide more guidance and clarification as regards the text; particularly insists on the need to ensure a better coordination of, and matching between, the allocation of slots by Air Traffic Flow Management (AFTM) and airport slots, notably in relation to the effectiveness of the slot coordination committees as regards departures and arrivals, and additionally insists on the need to harmonise the definitions, tolerances and the way airport and AFTM slots are awarded;\n",
        "22. Recalls the need to introduce market-based mechanisms in the slot allocation process with a view to achieving the best possible use of scarce airport capacity; points out, however, that, according to Regulation (EC) No 95/93 as amended in 2004, the Commission had to submit a report to Parliament and to the Council on the operation of this Regulation by April 2007 at the latest, and that the introduction of a market-based mechanism should only be considered on the basis of such a report;\n",
        "23. Notes, however, that recourse to market-based mechanisms, such as slot allocation in order to make better use of existing airport capacity, would not address infrastructure shortages, as such a mechanism would not create a single additional slot; believes, furthermore, that coherence between airport slots and ATFM slots has very limited benefits and will not solve the capacity problem as this problem will always exist;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Council to lay down a time-frame and deadlines in order to enhance  cooperation between civil aviation authorities of neighbouring Member States so as to guarantee a significant step forward before 2008 as regards the building of functional airspace blocks;\n",
        "25. Emphasises the need for a precise time-frame for the implementation of the FABs and notes the positive steps taken in this regard by some Member States, particularly in Northern and Central Europe, for example the Northern Upper Area Control (NUAC) programme and the new FAB Europe Central projects;\n",
        "26. Urges the Commission, if no significant progress has been made by Member States on this issue by 2008, to take a top-down approach in order to guarantee substantial improvements;\n",
        "27. Stresses the importance of the Galileo project in optimising the use of existing and future air transport management capacity, and notes that the right lessons need to be learnt, in the interest of the implementation of the SESAR project, from the current financial difficulties with Galileo;\n",
        "28. Is concerned that the rate of innovation and uptake of new technologies may be much slower than the growth rate of air travel; stresses, furthermore, that new internationally agreed noise stringency standards and a new approach to limit the number of people affected by noise, will be needed; Enhancing cooperation on capacity between airport regions\n",
        "29. Is of the opinion that an increase in airport capacity will not be possible without efficient and thorough collaboration between airport authorities and the relevant regional and local administrations;  provided that any such collaboration does not contravene Community competition rules;\n",
        "30. Welcomes any airport region initiative that would lead to a Europe-wide dialogue on the issues relating to the development of additional airport capacity, particularly on capacity coordination or integration, on the environmental consequences for neighbouring populations, on land-use planning and on growth and employment;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission to urge Member States to strengthen their town-planning and building regulations so that noise and other pollution caused by airports to their surrounding areas can be prevented;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to facilitate the exchange of best practice concerning the public management of those airport regions and to financially support pilot projects and research programmes connected with the issue of the impact that airports have on surrounding territories and their residents;\n",
        "33. Wishes to see 'regional development' airports in isolated, remote or ultra-peripheral regions continue to benefit from state aid proportionate to the tasks they perform in the general interest;\n",
        "34. Believes that airline companies should provide adequate guarantees and assume responsibility when it comes to the redemption of the airport facilities that they require airport managers to provide, so as not to place the latter in difficulty in the event of unexpected withdrawal prior to full redemption; Ground handling services\n",
        "35. Takes note of the abovementioned Commission report on the application of Council Directive 96/67/EC ;\n",
        "36. Welcomes the positive impact that the Directive, as reported by the Commission, has had, but notes, firstly, that the positive assessment is based on the findings of the 2002 study which did not cover the whole of the enlarged Union; whereas it has been noticed that the implementation of the Directive is a matter of particular concern in the Member States that joined the EU after this date; and,second, that difficulties and uncertainties concerning its implementation remain, in particular as regards the criteria to be met by service providers that engage in competitive calls for tenders; invites the Commission to issue detailed guidance or, where appropriate, put forward new proposals to clarify the rules pertaining to calls for tender;\n",
        "37. Invites the Commission to carry out a new impact analysis on the implementation of the Directive, its final benefits and/or disadvantages for users, employees and passengers, before making any proposal that would lead to further liberalisation;\n",
        "38. Considers that, on the basis of this new impact assessment, the Commission could, if necessary, provide additional guidance on the interpretation of certain provisions that could leave airports with too wide a margin of  interpretation, and which have the potential to lead to  undesirable consequences in terms of the ability of ground handlers to enter the market ;\n",
        "39. Considers, on the other hand, that some provisions need rapid clarification, such as those relating to the protection of workers in the event of a transfer of undertakings, and access fees; urges the Commission, therefore, to provide guidance on the interpretation of those provisions as soon as possible;\n",
        "40. Recommends that any new attempt to amend the Directive should first concentrate on the quality of ground handling services and on the quality of employment in ground handling; particularly invites the Commission to:\n",
        "41. Points out that, for the selection of ground handlers supplying restricted services, the opinion of airline users is sometimes not thoroughly considered by airports, and recalls that there have been cases where ground handlers providing restricted services have been chosen against the quasi-unanimous opinion of the user committee;\n",
        "42. Insists on the need for more transparency and for stricter user-oriented provisions concerning the choice of ground handlers for restricted services; insists, in particular, that the possibility of establishing additional rules for the Airport Users Committee be considered, consisting, for example, of the obligation to give reasons as to why the choice made by the airport does not follow the opinion of the Committee; notes that such a decision could also, in this case, be passed on to an authority independent of the airport's managing body; finally suggests to the Commission that it consider, in any future amendment to Directive 96/67/EC,whether airlines already operating ground handling services in the airport through third-party handlers  should be excluded from voting as regards the selection of any new entrant;\n",
        "43. Notes that, since the adoption of Directive 96/67/EC, competition has noticeably intensified and that the prices for ground handling services have decreased in almost all ‘old’ EU Member States; 0 0   0\n",
        "44. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
