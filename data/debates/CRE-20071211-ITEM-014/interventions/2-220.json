{"speaker": "Richard James Ashworth,", "english": "Richard James Ashworth, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, this 2008 budget is a good result and for that I must compliment my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets, especially our chairman, Mr Böge, and our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, who I think have done an extremely good job. Like the Commissioner, I believe that this budget reflects more adequately the changing priorities of the Union today and it is more appropriate to the challenges which we face.\nI welcome the fact that it represents 0.96% GNI and I am also happy to see that the funding for Frontex is much more appropriate to the challenge that this organisation faces.\nThere are, however, two areas of concern. My first area is Galileo and, while it is not for me to comment on the technical merit of this project, I can and I certainly must comment on the financial disciplines which I see imposed. It was of concern to me that the private sector appeared to show a very low appetite for investment in this project. It would appear to me that there is little or no provision for cost and time overruns with the project, which are almost inevitable, and it does concern me that the vision for the business model after the development phase leaves a great deal to be desired.\nThe second point which I want to mention is that this budget falls under the shadow of the Court of Auditors’ report. I have to say that, after 13 failures, this is something which must be taken very seriously. It is something which is extremely damaging to the public perception of the European Union.\nTwo points are absolutely clear. I make my points here to the Presidency, the Member States and the Commission. They must give greater urgency to achieving a positive DAS because – I repeat my words – it is very, very damaging to the perception of the Union. Secondly, and on that point, I believe it is time for Parliament to be more assertive in ensuring that the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement are met.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard James Ashworth, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, this 2008 budget is a good result and for that I must compliment my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets, especially our chairman, Mr Böge, and our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, who I think have done an extremely good job.
