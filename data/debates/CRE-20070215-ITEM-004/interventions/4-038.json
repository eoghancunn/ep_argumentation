{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, Commissioner, why are we still using oil to drive cars and heat homes? With increasing global demand for oil, the deterioration of the stability of the Middle East, particularly with the possibility of an Iranian war looming and with the search for oil becoming more difficult and expensive as the biggest oil fields play out, why do we not reserve oil for essential uses like some plastics or jet fuels, and use sustainable alternatives in motoring, home heating, electricity generation and other applications that are possible to substitute?\nWe will in fact get to the point where we reserve our oil, but will we do it far-sightedly and voluntarily or because prices force us? What will decide the question? Well, the answer lies in the way we support European R&D and the way we scale up European production of alternatives, not in the way we take alternative oils from other countries.\nThe closing and destroying of sugar factories in Ireland rather than turning them into ethanol factories does not give me confidence that we are yet serious about the need to switch to oil alternatives.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, Commissioner, why are we still using oil to drive cars and heat homes?
