{"speaker": "Joaquín Almunia,", "english": "Joaquín Almunia, Member of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, I simply wish to add a few words summarising a debate that I believe to be extremely important and relevant, relating to the report by Mr dos Santos.\nThere is no doubt that we will continue to talk about energy and we will continue to talk about it in direct relation to climate change and the strategy required to combat it. Energy policy cannot be separated from environmental policy. They form part of the same strategy. I believe that from a debate such as today’s, and other debates that we have held and that we will continue to hold on these issues, today’s more focussed on prices, others on other important aspects of this strategy, the conclusion is — at least this is my conclusion, and I believe that the majority of Members of this Parliament will agree with me — that action at European level, a common European policy, is essential.\nThis is a field in which European-level action demonstrates, when it is discussed, and will demonstrate, when we communicate it to the citizens, the added value of European Union action for the coming years and decades. From the point of view of security of supply, from the point of view of the sustainability required of any policy in the field of energy, and from the point of view of the quest for greater competitiveness within a context in which energy prices are unfortunately not going to be as low as they have been in the past, from all points of view, action at European Union-level is essential.\nI shall therefore conclude this debate, Madam President, by joining in the appeal that many of you have made this morning for more decisive action, firstly by the European Council of 8 March and, on that basis, by all of the European institutions, to achieve objectives such as those laid out in the report by Mr dos Santos.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joaquín Almunia, Member of the Commission.
