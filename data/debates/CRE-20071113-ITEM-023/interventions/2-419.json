{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis,", "english": "Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, congratulations to Mr Vakalis for his excellent work. This report highlights the fact that, although earthquakes can have a devastating economic and social impact in seismic-stricken regions, not enough attention has been paid to them by the EU. The rapporteur advocates – and rightly so – that a series of regulatory and financial measures are urgently needed in order to remedy this unhappy state of affairs. Such measures should aim at minimalisation of damage caused as well as facilitating speedy and effective response and compensation to affected individuals and communities.\nMr Vakalis states that an area which should be given special attention is that of research. I agree. Not necessarily of course research in predicting earthquakes, a practice which has been proven to have limitations, but research in the way we construct our buildings. Attention to more stable, robust and lightweight materials is an example. Safety features to prevent electrocution and electric fires being caused after a tremor are another area where research can help prevent loss of life. Research into telecommunications systems that do not get so easily jumped in the panic that follows an earthquake and research into specialised equipment for detecting and extracting victims from collapsed buildings are other areas where research can be most helpful and very rewarding.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, congratulations to Mr Vakalis for his excellent work.
