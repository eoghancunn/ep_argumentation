{"speaker": "Philip Bushill-Matthews,", "english": "Philip Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Madam President, the Commissioner has helpfully reminded us of the worldwide initiative on decent work and that it has been recently endorsed by the G8. Indeed, at a UN summit in September 2005 as many as 150 world leaders agreed that the International Labour Organisation concept of decent work should become a central objective of their own national policies. Essentially, of course, this agenda concerns countries where such a concept does not really exist. Within Europe, frameworks providing conditions for decent work are largely in place, though implementation here can always be improved.\nThe rapporteur has shown not only personal initiative in bringing this report to Parliament, but also that a member of the centre-right political family can not only take the lead on this important agenda but also generate substantial cross-party support.\nThat said, there were some close votes in committee that changed the overall balance of the report by inserting new points or paragraphs. These we hope to change in the full vote in the House later today, either by deletion or by modification via agreed compromises with other political groups. In promoting the concept of decent work, we should all be on the same side.\nOf course, Parliament does not have the powers to instruct Member States on what to do in this area, and rightly so: it is for Member State governments to decide. However, all such governments should surely agree the importance of providing lifelong-learning opportunities, the need to be proactive on increasing women’s participation in the labour market, the need to do so much more to resolve the challenges of reconciling work and family life and, above all, the need to offer help to the developing world.\nThis is a thoughtful report, which deserves to be widely read.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Madam President, the Commissioner has helpfully reminded us of the worldwide initiative on decent work and that it has been recently endorsed by the G8.
