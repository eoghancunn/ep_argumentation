{"speaker": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). –", "english": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this comprehensive and balanced report. There are a number of statements in this report that have given rise to some debate, but I would pose the question: is there anything in this report that should not apply to a member of my family? And whether members of my family live in Ireland or in Poland or indeed if they are third country nationals, I would want the provisions in this report to apply to them. So, if we really mean to promote decent work for all and not just those who because of their birth, their position in society or education can access decent work, then this report is a major step in the right direction.\nAs I said, this report is balanced. Just as a member of my family might be seeking work, they might equally be a small entrepreneur, an SME struggling to survive and thereby create decent work. This report promotes business that does not seek to exploit, that does not engage in social dumping and that does not violate core labour standards. I suspect that most of us would like to work for, or indeed manage such companies.\nThere is constant tension between the demands of the market and the promotion of a just and equitable society. One group of workers, carers – in fact the largest single group of workers in Europe – often falls between two stools. The market does not recognise or reward them as they do not contribute significantly to GDP growth. Yet they are the glue that holds society together. Without this group of workers societal structures as we know them would collapse, and then who would the market serve?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this comprehensive and balanced report.
