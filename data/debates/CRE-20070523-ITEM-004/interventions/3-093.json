We rightly criticise this but we buy, wear, eat and drink the products of abusive labour on a daily basis. As long as we do not insist, the abuse goes on.\nBut decent work is a two-way street. Working conditions must be fair for the worker, but also the worker must perform his or her service in a fair and responsible way. It is only when there is mutual decency and respect in the European workplace that the EU will be competitive and socially sustainable. I would like to congratulate Mrs Panayotopoulos on her report. She has covered all the areas of vulnerability – young workers, mothers, even breastfeeding mothers, part-time and older workers. She even mentions home workers, and I would like to think that this includes the unpaid family carer of children, disabled people and older family members.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Madam President, there is no question that in some countries exploitation of workers is the norm.
