It would be better if we were talking about the situation of people in rural areas rather than women , and indeed many of the problems for women also affect men in rural areas, but women have particular issues and I acknowledge that in this report.\nThat said, the quality of life for people who live in the countryside can be better in many cases, where they have sufficient resources, than in the city. I think the problem has always been that women’s work has not been measured, has not been paid for and therefore is not recognised. In some countries, some progress has been made on this, but I think Member States differ in how they treat women.\nI would like to mention a particular role that women play, and perhaps it has not been addressed yet. Women are still, in my view, the primary motivators and educators of children and they are generally the ones who decide whether a child will farm or not, and often decide the future of rural areas. We need to pay particular attention to that so that they have a positive view of agriculture, and not a negative one.\nLastly, few women own land and few are in farm organisations. That needs to be addressed.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur.
