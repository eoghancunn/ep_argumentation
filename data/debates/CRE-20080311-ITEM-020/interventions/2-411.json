{"speaker": "Mariann Fischer Boel,", "english": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I thank the House for a very encouraging debate with some fairly dedicated speeches – I really enjoy that. The discussion we have had tonight makes it clear again that the situation for women in rural areas really needs specific attention.\nAlthough I feel that some of you are a little pessimistic about the progress that has been made, I want to approach this from a more positive side. I think that quite a lot has been achieved, especially through the rural development tools, and I am confident that we are heading in the right direction when it comes to improving the position of women in rural areas.\nMany of you have mentioned that mainstreaming the gender issue into our policy and broadening its scope to the wider rural economy will enhance its effect. I fully subscribe to this approach. We should not limit our focus to the farm sector only. Embedding our policies in the needs and opportunities of rural society as a whole will create a multiplier effect that will also benefit the whole agricultural sector. The Commission will closely monitor this aspect with the implementation of the rural development programmes.\nSeveral of you mentioned the importance of broadband networks in rural areas. Here I have to say that there is a possibility within the third axis – the diversification axis – of the rural development policy to go into areas that, from an economic point of view, are not economically viable for investors. Those are remote areas where Member States can use the rural development policy to secure a broadband connection. I can only encourage all Member States to take this into consideration when they plan their investments or the use of their rural development policy.\nSome of you also mentioned the ‘hidden work’ that is being done by women on farms. I acknowledge that our statistics do not always reflect this fact. We should, using all the different tools, try to encourage women to seize the opportunities to gain their economic independence by giving them the associated social rights. For me, better possibilities for taking up part-time work for women in agriculture would be a huge step forward in strengthening rural incomes and also to help sustaining life in rural communities.\nI must say that I travel quite a lot in rural areas and I am always very encouraged when I meet women who cross the borderlines and take part in the work of the different farmers’ organisations. I know it is a big step for the first women to enter into these organisations but sometimes it spreads and it is not so difficult for the next one, although it requires some change of approach on the men’s side to accept that women can contribute on an equal footing in this area.\nI think there is quite a lot more to be said on this subject, which should not be pushed into the background. Let me assure you that I will wholeheartedly back all initiatives that can improve the position of women in rural areas, because I really think that we need this special approach from the female side to the diversification of rural areas.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I thank the House for a very encouraging debate with some fairly dedicated speeches – I really enjoy that.
