{"speaker": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Mr President, in acknowledging the hard work that our rapporteur, Ms Klaß, has put into this report entitled ‘The situation of women in rural areas of the EU’, I would have to ask: compared to men in rural areas or women in urban areas? What is the context in which we are talking here? There is no such homogeneous group as ‘women in rural areas of the EU’. I am a woman from a rural area of the EU, but the lady who lives down the road from me with six or seven children and a husband who is unemployed, and who cannot afford her rent or mortgage, is a different type of woman in a rural area. It is not a homogeneous group, and we must be very careful in this issue.\nMany women in rural areas have an urban lifestyle; others have a lot of poverty and hardship in their life. You have an urban lifestyle in the middle of the countryside if there are two cars outside the door, all mod cons, ICT and perhaps a foreign holiday a year. So let us give it some context.\nThe real issue here is the restoration of choices to all women: the choice to marry or not; the choice to have children or not, to have a career, to have further education or not, to stay at home, to go out into the workplace, to start a business or to have access to property.\nA few years ago when I went to buy an apartment in Brussels, the Brussels bank manager would not sign off my mortgage unless I got my husband to sign it. This was only a few years ago in Brussels. I got my mortgage and my husband did not sign it. Might I say that I objected strongly! So the access to money, property and business – there are lots of different types of women in rural areas.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Mr President, in acknowledging the hard work that our rapporteur, Ms Klaß, has put into this report entitled ‘The situation of women in rural areas of the EU’, I would have to ask: compared to men in rural areas or women in urban areas?
