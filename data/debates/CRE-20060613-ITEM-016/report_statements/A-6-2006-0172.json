    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the abovementioned judgment of the Court of Justice, which made it clear that the legal basis on which acts are adopted must be selected by reference to the aim and content of the act itself, and consequently annulled a framework decision on environmental protection which had been mistakenly adopted under the third, rather than the first, pillar;\n",
        "2.  Is pleased that the Court of Justice, on the basis of that finding, confirms that the European legislature may adopt, under the first pillar, any criminal provisions necessary to ensure that the rules laid down under that pillar - in this instance, on environmental protection - are fully effective;\n",
        "3.  Urges the Commission not to automatically extend the conclusions of the Court of Justice to every other field falling within the scope of the first pillar;\n",
        "4.  Reiterates, yet again, the urgent need to start the procedure, using Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, for inclusion of judicial and police cooperation on criminal matters in the Community pillar, which alone provides the conditions for adopting European provisions in full compliance with the principles of democracy and efficient decision‑making and under appropriate judicial control;\n",
        "5.   Takes the view that the European legislator must restrict the application of criminal sanctions to cases where they are essential and necessary for the protection:\n",
        "6.  Agrees with the Commission on the need to withdraw or amend pending legislative proposals whose legal basis should be regarded as incorrect in the light of the Court's abovementioned judgment;\n",
        "7.  Agrees with the Commission that it is necessary to find a new legal basis in the EC Treaty for items of legislation which have already been adopted under the third pillar and which, in the light of the abovementioned judgment of the Court of Justice, must be regarded as unlawful, and to remedy the situation by reopening the legislative procedure on the new legal basis;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission to review the acts it has specified on a case-by-case basis, instead of adopting an undifferentiated, across-the-board approach, in order to ensure that, after careful consideration, the correct legal basis is chosen in each individual case;\n",
        "9.   Asks the Commission to apply the judgment of the Court of Justice to those fields that are among the main principles, objectives and competences of the Community and to apply it with caution on a case-by-case basis and always in cooperation with the Council and the European Parliament; 10 Reminds the Commission that reviewing the legislation in force, and possibly submitting proposals designed to rectify the legal basis while leaving the substance of the legislation unchanged, must not involve depriving Parliament of its inalienable role as co-legislator and thus sacrificing the democratic input provided by Parliament, the elected body representing European citizens, in the process of European integration;\n",
        "11. Opposes any interinstitutional agreement that would oblige Parliament to abdicate the exercise of its rights;\n",
        "12. Notes, however, that the Court of Justice has ruled that a directive ‘cannot, of itself and independently of a national law adopted by a Member State for its implementation, have the effect of determining or aggravating the liability in criminal law of persons who act in contravention of the provisions of that directive’[8];\n",
        "13. Shares the Commission's view that any recourse to measures relating to the criminal law must be motivated by the need to give effect to the Community policy in question and must respect the internal consistency of the criminal law; considers that, as a general principle, it is the Member States which are responsible for the due application of Community law;\n",
        "14. Asks the Commission to bear in mind that the requisite conditions for including criminal provisions under the first pillar must be clear and determined in advance; that those requisite conditions are fulfilled only where it is not possible to ensure compliance with Community law except by recourse to criminal penalties; in particular, it is necessary to ascertain that there have been frequent and repeated infringements of Community law which it has not proved possible to stop by means of the legislation in force, even by invoking the law of individual Member States;\n",
        "15. Notes that Community law in the form of directives can only lay down minimum rules for criminal penalties to be applied by the Member States; considers, however, that in certain cases it is appropriate to buttress the action taken by Member States by specifically stating (a) what type of conduct should incur criminal charges and/or (b) what type of penalties should be applied and/or (c) other measures relating to criminal law which are applicable in the relevant context;\n",
        "16. Reminds Member States that, pursuant to Article 10 of the EC Treaty, they are obliged to ensure that Community action is generally effective, and consequently urges them to do their utmost to ensure that the provisions of their respective national criminal law are also designed to comply with that objective;\n",
        "17. Agrees with the Commission that, in any event, ‘horizontal’ criminal law provisions designed to promote judicial and police cooperation between Member States, and measures to harmonise criminal law in the context of the area of freedom, security and justice, must be based on Title VI of the EU Treaty;\n",
        "18. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, and to the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States.\n"
