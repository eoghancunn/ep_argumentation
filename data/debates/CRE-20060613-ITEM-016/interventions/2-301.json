All countries agree to be bound by the same body of EU law, which they then undertake to enforce upon themselves.

Indeed, do we really expect courts to behave in the same way in all 25 EU countries, including our new eastern European Member States and those who are yet to join? I fear that politicians will agree to progressively harmonise enforcement, but the peoples of our different countries will not.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, this issue shows up the most basic weakness in the whole EU structure.
