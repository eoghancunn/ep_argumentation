    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Underlines that the overarching aim of development cooperation is and must be the fight against poverty; stresses, however, that this fight is not limited to material growth and therefore, democracy-building and the promotion of basic human rights, rule of law and the principles of justice, equity, transparency and accountability must always be central themes of any such cooperation;\n",
        "2.  Recalls the commitment made by G8 countries at Gleneagles in 2005 to double aid to Sub-Saharan Africa by 2010 and expresses disappointment that, according to the OECD, ODA excluding debt relief to Sub-Saharan Africa 'was static in 2006';\n",
        "3.  Stresses that in order to meet their financial commitments to Africa, the G8 donors will each have to provide an additional EUR 15bn to Africa by 2010, over and above their 2004 levels, but that they are so far off track;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the action taken by many EU countries in writing off the debt of developing countries; expresses concern, nevertheless, that such debt write-offs have artificially boosted EU aid figures by nearly 30% in 2006, meaning that the Member States spent 0.31% of GNI onactualaid last year, missing the collective intermediary objective of 0.33%;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the EU and the G8 to disaggregate debt cancellation and relief from aid figures in line with the 2002 Monterrey Consensus and the Council Conclusions of April 2006;\n",
        "6.  Regrets that at the mid-point in the implementation period for the MDGs, ODA from the EU-15 is decreasing as a share of GNI from 0.44% ODA/GNI in 2005 to 0.43% ODA/GNI in 2006;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the fact that aid provided by the Commission rose by 5.7% to €7.5 billionin 2006, reflecting improved disbursement capacity from the higher level of commitments made in recent years;\n",
        "8.  Commends those Member States that have reached or exceeded the 0.7% ODA/GNI target and those that are increasing theiractualaid levels, but regrets that some EU-15 countries have missed the interim 0.33% target by a large margin in 2006;\n",
        "9.  Notes that as a large G8 country, Italy missed the 0.33% target by wide margin, with its aid in 2006 amounting to only 0.2% of its national income, after a 30% drop in real aid levels;\n",
        "10. Notes that Portugal, which is due to host the EU-Africa Summit during its Presidency, achieved only 0.21% ODA/GNI in 2006;\n",
        "11. Notes that the worst inflators of aid are Austria (57%), France (52%), Italy (44%), Germany (53%) and the UK (28%), and further notes that Germany, which holds the Presidencies of both the EU and G8, would not have reached the target of 0.33% ODA/GNI without inflating its aid;\n",
        "12. Calls on all Member States that are off-track to honour the promises made in Barcelona, Gleneagles and Monterrey and to urgently commit themselves to a scaling up of real aid in 2007 and calls on the Commission to support those Member States in planning carefully for the financial and organisational aspects for forthcoming aid increases to ensure the EU interim 2010 target of 0.56% GNI is met;\n",
        "13. Argues that the budget review, starting in 2008, should take into account the EU's increasingly important role in the world and enable development expenditure to increase, in this context, the EU could decide to implement new forms of funding MDGs such as through the European Investment Bank (EIB);\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission to plan for the clear likelihood that the 10th EDF will not be ratified by all 27 Member States before 2010 and should therefore urgently ensure that funds are available during the transitional period (2008–2010);\n",
        "15. Urges the Commission to continue to explore innovative sources of finance as alternative ways of securing funding for development programmes but stresses that this should be in addition to the commitment to reaching 0.7% of GNI for ODA;\n",
        "16. Urges EU Member States to undertake regular assessments of progress towards ODA targets and welcomes the Commission proposal that EU Member States put national timetables in place to ensure that they are on track towards reaching agreed country ODA targets by 2010/2015 and to improve the long-term predictability of their aid flows;\n",
        "17. Urges the EU and the G8 to recognise the growing importance of new donors, and in particular China, and to engage these new donors in a dialogue on approaches and standards for external assistance, including the importance of applying internationally agreed norms and standards in aid implementation;\n",
        "18. Calls on G8 countries to delink all aid from their national economic interests, noting that as a group, the G8 currently tie 29% of their aid to developing countries, as opposed to the total donor average of 24%;\n",
        "19. Underlines that possibly as many as 60 countries need all of their debts to be cancelled if they are to have any chance of achieving the MDGs and that there are yet more countries that require further debt relief, including a number of countries with “odious debts”, such as those contracted by South Africa’s former apartheid regime;\n",
        "20. Welcomes the World Bank finding that countries receiving debt relief under Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) have, between 1999 and 2005, more than doubled their expenditure on poverty reduction plans;\n",
        "21. Calls on countries to meet their obligations to use funds released by debt relief and cancellation transparently and accountably and further argues that debt relief should only be withheld if there is a broad consensus in the parliament and among civil society organisations that standards of transparency and accountability are not being met;\n",
        "22. Stresses that long-term debt sustainability will depend upon responsible lending policies, the provision of appropriate financing, the maintenance of sound economic policies, strengthened debt management and sound public and parliamentary accountability of loan contraction, as well as export performance and particularly export diversification;\n",
        "23. Calls on those Member States which are attaching harmful structural conditions to debt relief, such as privatisations, sectoral restructurings, trade and financial liberalisation and links to macroeconomic targets of the International monetary Fund (IMF), to end this practice;\n",
        "24. Calls on all donors and creditors to make all information relating to loans and debt write offs easily available and accessible in partner countries and to insist on the same transparency for commercial creditors;\n",
        "25. Calls on Member States to act on the 'supply side' of corruption by investigating, prosecuting and blacklisting bribe givers and to protect poor countries from 'Vulture Funds';\n",
        "26. Calls on the World Bank to make more concessional financing available to countries striving to achieve the MDGs;\n",
        "27. Urges the EU to increase its ODA commitments to education to fill the €5.3 billion financing gap and given that the major challenge facing the Education For All – Fast Track Initiative (FTI) is lack of external finance, the Commission is to be commended for initiating efforts to increase donor pledges but regrets that while commitments made at the Donor Conference held in Brussels on May 2nd 2007 should enable 1 million more children able to go to school, but that still leaves another 76 million without an education;\n",
        "28. Calls on the EU to increase its proportion of global ODA for health from the current 6.6%, in order to help bridge the financing gap of €11.9bn per year of the total estimated €21bn per year needed to fulfil global health spending needs and calls for continuing and increased, predictable support for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria;\n",
        "29. Calls on the African Union (AU) to continue its support for the Abuja Declaration of 2001 which confirms that countries should allocate at least 15% of their national budgets for healthcare but regrets that only two African States have met this promise;\n",
        "30. Stresses that developing-country governments have made real progress in the last decade on increasing investment in health and education but that in some cases promises have not been fulfilled and calls on these governments to set a timetable for reaching the target of investing at least 20% of government budgets in education and the target of investing 15% of government budgets to health;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Court of Auditors to implement in 2008 an audit of the commitment in the DCI that by 2009, 20% of all EC ODA is allocated to basic health and to basic and secondary education;\n",
        "32. Emphasises that it is a priority to ensure that 'hard to reach' children – those from conflict affected fragile states, those with disabilities, from remote regions, chronically poor families or those excluded on the grounds of ethnicity – can access their right to basic education;\n",
        "33. Calls on the EU to give urgent attention to education in conflict affected-fragile states, which currently receive less than a fifth of global education aid despite being home to more than half the world's children missing out on education, and in particular calls on the Humanitarian Aid Department of the Commission (ECHO) to follow through on clear guidelines for ECHO support to education in emergency responses;\n",
        "34. Calls on the EU to assist countries in building national capacity to track learning outcomes in order to ensure that expanded access to education also delivers a quality education;\n",
        "35. Deplores the fact that virtually no country in Africa is on track to achieve the MDGs for maternal and child health;\n",
        "36. Notes that progress on child mortality lags behind other MDGs despite the availability of simple, low cost interventions that could prevent millions of deaths each year and stresses that oral rehydration therapy, insecticide treated bednets, breastfeeding, and common antibiotics for respiratory diseases could prevent an estimated 63% of child deaths;\n",
        "37. Believes that health care infrastructure deserves stable and long term financial support from national budgets and international assistance in order to deliver on the health-related MDGs, such as reducing infant mortality by increasing immunization coverage, reducing maternal mortality by increasing access to skilled professionals, supporting research and development of and access to new diagnostics and therapies, providing safe drinking water and sanitation, and scaling up significantly towards the goal of universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support of HIV/AIDS, Malaria, TB and other diseases by 2010, including for marginalized populations and those most vulnerable to infectious diseases;\n",
        "38. Calls on the international donor community to assist developing countries in developing and implementing comprehensive health programmes of action, tackling issues such as the need to secure sustainable financing for health infrastructure and salaries, increase investment in training and avoid excessive “brain drain” through the migration of high-skilled health workers;\n",
        "39. Welcomes the Johannesburg Declaration of the 3rd Ordinary Session of AU Conference of Ministers of Health of 9-13 April 2007 on Strengthening of Health Systems for Equity and Development as an important initiative towards achieving the Health MDGs; calls on the EU to support the AU member states in implementing the programmes based on this declaration;\n",
        "40. Urges the EU to continue to be at the vanguard of efforts to support sexual and reproductive health rights by maintaining levels of funding for the implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action and regrets that while Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of maternal mortality, it also has the lowest rate of contraceptive use in the world (19%) and 30% of all maternal deaths on the continent are caused by unsafe abortions;\n",
        "41. Points out that the UN plans to adopt a new target on MDG 5 on Universal Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and thereforenotesthe Maputo Plan of Action for the Operationalisation of the Continental Policy Framework for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights 2007–2010 adopted by the Special Session of AU Conference of Ministers of Health of 18-22 September 2006 (Maputo Plan of Action);\n",
        "42. Stresses the urgent need to tackle gender-based violence in all forms because violence impacts of girls access to education and health and is also one of the main drivers of the HIV pandemic and therefore a key barrier to achieving greater gender equality in developing countries;\n",
        "43. Calls on the Commission to step up its commitment to combating HIV/Aids in developing countries and to ensure that those hardest hit have ever-better access, at affordableprices, to prevention resources and policies, antiretroviral treatments and healthcare services (infrastructure, personnel and medicines) capable of meeting the growing demand;\n",
        "44. Notes that all the MDGs are critically dependent on stemming the AIDS epidemic and asks the Commission to accord the highest priority to addressing this global pandemic by supporting an intensified and comprehensive response; points out that the response should ensure universal access to existing prevention and treatment as well as adequate investments in development of and universal access to a wide range of prevention technologies including microbicides and vaccines; and calls on the EU to promote expanded industry participation, a more coordinated scientific effort, and policies and programmes that accelerate the testing of novel vaccines and microbicides;\n",
        "45. Calls on the EU to increase funding to ensure that progress in basic science and biomedicine results in new and affordable drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics for neglected diseases; to support the development phases of R&D; and to secure the use of new products by neglected populations;\n",
        "46. Calls on the EU to support the full implementation of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 9-14 November 2001, and to ensure that medicines are affordable for those for those developing countries that do take measures in compliance with the Declaration and further calls on the EU to provide technical assistance to developing countries for the implementation of pro public health measures in patent law;\n",
        "47. Stresses the need for a comprehensive review of those systems in place that are failing to solve the access to medicines problem, this includes submitting recommendations to the WTO for amendment to its rules governing the exportation of medicines under compulsory license, known as the August 30th decision;\n",
        "48. Points out that according to some estimates, two million teachers and over 4 million health workers need to be recruited to make health and education for all a reality and €10bn must be invested every year in training and salaries for quality teachers and health workers;\n",
        "49. Calls on poor country governments to set salaries of existing health workers and teachers at dignified levels in collaboration with their trade unions;\n",
        "50. Calls on poor country governments to ensure parliamentary and citizen representation and oversight in monitoring public services and facilitate the participation of civil society and local authorities in local and national planning and budget processes, including agreements and contracts signed with donors;\n",
        "51. Stresses that in some countries rates of malnutrition are increasing and that for the whole of Africa, an estimated 3.7 million more children will be malnourished in 2015 than today and calls on the EU to review and evaluate whether their indirect investments deal effectively with malnutrition;\n",
        "52. Calls on EU donors to immediately start reporting using internationally agreed indicators on nutrition to report progress on food security, safety nets and social protection, governance, water, sanitation and health;\n",
        "53. Insists that Commission and Member States use the Code of Conduct on Donor Coordination to ensure that spending and programmes on health and education are better coordinated and to ensure an improved focus on neglected aid orphan countries, including countries in crisis and fragile states;\n",
        "54. Urges all Member States to fully implement the agreed Paris Declaration to improve aid effectiveness and stresses that more effort needs to be made by the EU in relation to mutual accountability, ownership of partner countries and reform of technical assistance because DAC Member States scored badly on these three areas in the recent OECD baseline survey on implementing the Paris Declaration;\n",
        "55. Calls on the EU to support partners to build their in country capacity to lead a coherent development management process, as this remains central to ensuring countries rightful ownership and leadership of their own development process;\n",
        "56. Believes that micro-financing is one of the most essential instruments in the fight against poverty as it empowers the poor themselves to actively participate in this fight;\n",
        "57. Believes that gender specific priorities and children's rights need to be re-focused in Community development policy as basic rights and as part of the governance criteria applied under the Cotonou Agreement[9]and elsewhere;\n",
        "58. Welcomes the EC Partnership on Gender for Development and Peace that has recently been launched, with the aim of ensuring that gender is not sidelined in the implementation and review of the Paris Declaration;\n",
        "59. Believes that Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PSRPs) and Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) are potentially important tools for achieving the MDGs, but that they should be drafted, implemented, monitored and evaluated in consultation with parliaments in ACP countries and Member States, the Parliament, civil society and local authorities and should focus on meeting MDG objectives;\n",
        "60. Expresses concern about the lack of flexibility in EC programming which defines limited priorities at the start of a programming cycle and then does not allow for new issues to be supported, even if requested directly by partner governments;\n",
        "61. Stresses that the long-term goal of development cooperation must be to create the conditions for sustainable economic, social and environmental development; underlines, in this context, the need to promote public-private growth initiative partnerships, including support measures to small and medium-sized enterprises, to raise productivity and employment;\n",
        "62. Stresses the high potential of foreign direct investment to development, sustained economic growth, the transfer of know-how, entrepreneurship and technology and job creation; underlines, in this context, the importance of a transparent, predictable and favourable investment climate, minimizing red tape for business, respecting property rights, promoting competition and striving for sound macroeconomic policies;\n",

        "64. Calls on the Commission to ensure that when funds are spent on infrastructure, poverty reduction remains the key focus of all projects;\n",
        "65. Acknowledges that current EU Funds and Facilities such as the Infrastructure Facility, the Water Facility and the Energy Facility address important issues, but questions whether either individually or collectively they add up to significant MDG focussed support;\n",
        "66. Calls on the EU to strengthen its partnerships with developing countries in a way that encourages mutual accountability and reciprocal obligations by establishing predictable benchmarks and deadlines for ODA increases, in order to facilitate recipient countries' planning for increases in public investments;\n",
        "67. Stresses that all means must be used to attain the MDGs and that this necessitates the broadest possible partnerships of stakeholders, especially with developing country national parliaments and civil society and local authorities and private partners;\n",
        "68. Trusts that agreement will be reached during the drafting of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy on the fundamental importance of reaching the MDG targets by 2015;\n",
        "69. Insists that the EU and partner governments ensure that budget support always takes the form of sector specific budget aid that earmarks money for a specific sector in which the funding should be spent, use poverty-related targets that directly measure the outcome of policies instead of budgetary input and output, put in place mechanisms and monitoring tools to ensure that an adequate proportion of General Budget Support aid is supporting basic needs, particularly health and education, stresses that this must be accompanied by support for capacity building, and stresses that a percentage of 0.5 % of the granted budget support should be reserved exclusively for civil society watchdogs;\n",
        "70. Calls on the EU to support coherent MDG management of General Budget Support across different parts of the executive and legislatures and to provide support for parliamentary civil society and local authorities scrutiny of budget support to ensure a strong and clear link between budget support aid and the achievement of the MDGs;\n",
        "71. Calls for national parliament and civil society participation in effective budgetary monitoring in the form of public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) which make a detailed comparison between ‘income’ and ‘outcome’ on the basis of the criteria of the OECD DAC;\n",
        "72. Calls on the EU to increase the proportion of aid spent through direct budget support to those countries that have given proof of good governance, respect for human rights and the principles of democracy;\n",
        "73. Stresses that budget support in its common form is essentially another short term agreement between donors and governments, with few agreements exceeding three years and calls on donors to increase the term of commitment they make, possibly along the lines proposed by the EC for ‘MDG Contracts’ involving six year commitments and clear understandings and clarity on when and how such support would be suspended;\n",
        "74. Calls on countries to focus on the implications of General Budget Support for women’s equality and gender relations because overall increases in financing do not necessarily overcome the unequal access and status of marginalised groups including women and people with disabilities;\n",
        "75. Recalls that the Cotonou Agreement has a framework for dialogue between EU and ACP states on governance issues and calls on the EU to strengthen this framework instead of adding new initiatives, strategies and policies;\n",
        "76. Regrets that the EC governance instrument which is presented as an incentive tranche for budget support reduces the MDGs to only one of twenty three indicators, with other indicators such as trade liberalisation, counter terrorism and migration which are irrelevant to the implementation of the MDGs and believes that the governance instrument should be focused on the commitment of the partner country to implement the MDGs;\n",
        "77. Urges the EC to grasp the opportunity presented by the 2008 Review of the Governance Profile approach to listen to the views of European and African parliaments and civil society organisations, as well as Member States and African governments, and adapt its governance approach accordingly;\n",
        "78. Recalls that peace and security is vital to achieving the MDGs, and therefore urges the EU to ensure its development policies have a positive impact on peacebuilding;\n",
        "79. Recalls the commitment to mainstream conflict-sensitivity in all EU policies and instruments, as advocated in the 2001 Goteborg Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, and calls on the EU to implement the latest adopted tools to prevent conflict such as the EU Small Arms and Light Weapons Strategy, the EU Policy Framework for Security Sector Reform and the Joint EU Concept on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Re-integration (DDR);\n",
        "80. Welcomes the fact that an Arms Trade Treaty now has the support of 80% of the world's governments, and urges the EU to play its part in ensuring that there can be an international, legally binding treaty;\n",
        "81. Calls on the EU to adopt a coherent policy between its trade,fisheries, development cooperation and common agricultural policies to avoid direct or indirect negative impacts on the economy of developing countries;\n",
        "82. Stresses that opening up trade can be one of the most effective drivers of economic growth, but that it needs to be complemented by redistributive and social domestic policies in order for poverty to be reduced;\n",
        "83. Stresses the promise of the Doha Development Round and the need for fair and equitable international rules-based trade systems designed to correct the trading imbalances in global trade, especially where Africa is concerned, calls on the EU to make a maximum effort to end the stalemate in the WTO negotiations;\n",
        "84. Notes that according to the Chair of the deadlocked Doha Round, in order to facilitate a development friendly agreement, the EU must envisage cutting its trade distorting agricultural export subsidies by an estimated 70% and that agreement on subsidy and tariff cuts must be reached in order that the negotiations are concluded by the end of 2007;\n",
        "85. Believes that Fair Trade is an important tool in building sustainable trade with fair returns for producers in the developing world; calls on the Commission to respond to the Parliament's resolution on Fair Trade and Development with a Recommendation to support Fair Trade as outlined in paragraph 1 and 2 of the resolution;\n",
        "86. Calls on the Commission to ensure that its commercial agreements contribute to, instead of hampering, the achievement of the MDGs; in particular, it should ensure that Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) constitute instruments for ACP development and poverty eradication;\n",
        "87. Believes that intellectual property provisions should be excluded from EPAs and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) negotiations notably TRIPs-plus provisions which go beyond the TRIPs Agreement, such as data exclusivity and limitations of the grounds of Compulsory Licenses;\n",
        "88. Believes that all ACP countries must have a clear right to choose whether to extend the negotiations beyond trade in goods, calls on the Commission to ensure that intellectual property rights and the Singapore issues (competition policy, public procurement and investment) are taken of the negotiating table if ACP countries do not wish to negotiate these issues;\n",
        "89. Takes note of recent studies by UNCTAD and others that show that extensive trade liberalisation in LDCs had little effect on sustained and substantial poverty reduction objectives and has contributed to a decline in the terms of trade of developing countries, in particular of African countries, and calls on the EU to start a sustained, sincere campaign to genuinely increase the export capacity of these LDCs by promoting technical assistance to further physiosanitary standards, property law, business skills and value addition programmes;\n",
        "90. Calls on the Commission to adjust its cooperation and trade policies as far as possible in order to help governments of developing countries to maintain and develop public services, particularly those guaranteeing access for the population as whole to drinking water, health services, education and transport;\n",
        "91. Urges that full account should be taken of the fact that ACP countries are often heavily dependent on primary commodities, which are particularly vulnerable to price fluctuations and tariff escalation, and stresses the importance of diversification, the development of processing industries and SMEs in those countries;\n",
        "92. Stresses the importance of capacity building for trade and the need for additional resources from the EU to enhance ACP countries' ability to identify needs and strategies, to negotiate and to support regional integration, for diversification and preparation for liberalisation by enhancing production, supply and trading capacity and offsetting adjustment costs as well as to increase their ability to attract investment;\n",
        "93. Calls on the Commission to increase its trade related assistance to support capacity building which is essential if the poorest countries are to be able to tackle the increased competition resulting from market liberalisation;\n",
        "94. Insists that resources to cover aid for trade must be additional to those provided under the 10th EDF in line with ACP demands that EPA adjustment be financed separately from and in addition to the 10th EDF;\n",
        "95. Urges the EU to continue to play a leading role in promoting cleaner, more efficient approaches to sustainable and low carbon development;\n",
        "96. Points out that poor communities in developing countries have contributed the least to climate change but are likely to suffer the effects most severely; calls on the EU to make significant funding available to enable developing countries to adapt to sea level rises and increased strength and frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, heavy storms, flooding, etc., as well as to ensuing health, food production and water stresses, which would put development at risk and may lead to large-scale migration and security threats;\n",
        "97. Calls on the EU to make significant funding available to enable poor countries to adapt to climate change and stresses that this money cannot simply be channelled from existing aid budgets and that payments should be additional and compensatory and further believes that a significant proportion of the revenue raised by auctioning allocations under the European Trading Scheme and taxing carbon should be used to fund clean development in developing countries;\n",
        "98. Stresses that adaptation must not be dealt with only as a humanitarian issue or as a priority only within the context of the climate convention; emphasizes that risk reduction and \"climate proofing\" measures must be integrated into the overarching development agenda, including in PRSPs and CSPs;\n",
        "99. Calls on the EU to introduce emergency measures to allow poor countries to manufacture patented clean development technology in order to help address energy poverty and help avoid the problem of rapidly rising emissions in poor countries as they grow;\n",
        "100.    Stresses that although energy is not specifically addressed in the Millennium Declaration, the provision of modern energy services to the poor is a crucial prerequisite to meet the MDGs; points out that the preconditions for renewable energy technologies are excellent in many developing countries, providing an effective way of meeting soaring oil costs and meeting energy needs while avoiding further harmful climate impact; regrets that insufficient financial resources have been allocated by the EU for addressing the energy poverty challenge; emphasizes for this purpose the need for increased aid flows, as well as enhanced support for private investments in renewable energy technologies;\n",
        "101.    Stresses that if the MDGs are achieved, the proportion of people in poverty will be halved within a decade, a huge achievement but one that will nevertheless leave hundreds of millions of poorest and most vulnerable people trapped in chronic poverty;\n",
        "102.    Calls on the EU to set a date for agreement on a Poverty Elimination Strategy post 2015;\n",
        "103.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the accession countries, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD;\n"
