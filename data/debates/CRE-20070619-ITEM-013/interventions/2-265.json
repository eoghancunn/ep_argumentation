{"speaker": "Toomas Savi (ALDE). –", "english": "Toomas Savi (ALDE). – Mr President, I should like to make two points concerning the midway point for the Millennium Development Goals.\nFirst, it is quite obvious that the eradication of poverty in the world is one of the most important challenges of the 21st century for the whole of mankind. For me, as a medical doctor, it is perfectly clear that poverty and diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis go hand in hand, creating a ‘tsunami’ that wipes out millions of lives a year. It is unfortunate that this awful tragedy has now become a bland, everyday statistic. The eradication of poverty presupposes the elimination of those diseases and the strengthening of the health system in Africa through the provision of at least the projected USD 60 billion over the coming years by the G8 countries. Today’s world has a chance to consign those diseases to the history books, and we have to succeed.\nI also welcome the G8 decision to cancel 100% of the outstanding obligations of the highly indebted poor countries to the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank.\nThe MDGs can be achieved only in peaceful conditions, which means that many local military conflicts in Africa must be ended, especially the lengthy crisis in Darfur that has disregarded elementary human rights.\nSecondly, I should like to point out that the new Member States, which just recently were recipients of official development assistance and which, for several years, have seen a rapid growth in their GDP, should increase their contributions, not only meet their fixed goals. Naturally, I support the Kinnock report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Toomas Savi (ALDE). – Mr President, I should like to make two points concerning the midway point for the Millennium Development Goals.\nFirst, it is quite obvious that the eradication of poverty in the world is one of the most important challenges of the 21st century for the whole of mankind.
