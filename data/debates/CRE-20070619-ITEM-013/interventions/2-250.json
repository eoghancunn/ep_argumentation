{"speaker": "Louis Michel,", "english": "Louis Michel, Member of the Commission . (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I shall make a few comments, as I have been asked to do, about the outcome of the Heiligendamm Summit regarding development issues and issues relating to Africa.\nThe mere fact that these issues should once again have received particular attention was already in itself good news. The reaffirmation of Africa as an important subject in the G8 process is a good thing, but it is obviously nothing special considering the actual results. I quite understand the criticisms of those who are disappointed by the references to development aid. The compromise adopted limits itself to simply reiterating the Gleneagles commitment, and I think we could have been more ambitious.\nWe know that the European Union of 27 will, for its part, be financing between 80 and 100% of the G8 commitment to Africa. We should not allow the G8 members to neglect their own commitment which, as I recall, consisted of doubling aid to Africa. Some G8 members are not at all on the right track for honouring this commitment. Overall American aid, for example, has fallen by 20% and Japan’s by 10%, and they should certainly do more.\nWith regard to questions of governance as well as fundamental principles of development policy, I am reasonably happy that our approach to good governance, that is to say one that is multidimensional and holistic, as well as the wording that we suggested, have been retained in the final declaration on Africa. Our governance strategy is focused on results and on offering incentives for reform to those countries that are engaged in appropriate and credible reforms of governance based on sound political will.\nI am pleased to highlight the fact that the work of the G8 Summit this year focused particularly on education: that is undoubtedly one of our most valuable contributions. The declaration clearly expresses the necessity for financing those needs that are not covered and that are estimated to have a monetary value of USD 500 million for 2007 in all the countries that come under the Fast Track Initiative.\nI am also delighted with the final text on financial resources for health issues, for the Global Fund and for programmes for the prevention of transmission from mother to child. The USD 60 billion that were promised for the next few years in order to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis represent a clear and strict commitment in comparison with the cautious language that was used initially and that omitted any definite indication of the financial resources required.\nI am going to conclude my remarks concerning the G8 with an observation of a more general nature. The beauty contest of figures and declarations that the G8 seems to have become where development is concerned does not win over our African partners. Quite the contrary, as the latter confront us with the lack of results on the ground and, above all, with our lack of respect for our commitments. They do so all the more forcibly, moreover, having found an alternative model in China. Not only is China purchasing huge amounts of raw materials in Africa, but it is constructing roads, ministries and hospitals in the months following the request it received and the promise it made. That is quite a coup when our own procedures which, moreover, were basically established by the Council and the European Parliament, impose upon us de facto timescales of several years between the time when the agreement was reached and the time when it will actually be implemented.\nWe must also, however, learn a lesson where the G8 is concerned: while Africa is increasingly developing relations with emerging countries, the G8 beauty contest is going to become a side show which will become less and less convincing if we do not manage to include China and the other emerging countries in international initiatives on Africa and development. It is, indeed, for this reason that I shall be going to China at the beginning of July: to talk about Africa with Chinese colleagues.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I finish, I should like to say a few words about Mrs Kinnock’s report and therefore about the Millennium Development Goals at the midway point, the current relevance of which seems to me to be quite indisputable. I remain convinced that the Millennium Goals are within our reach, provided, of course, that all those active in development - not only the sponsors but also partner countries - honour their commitments. I should also like to emphasise the European Union’s firm and total commitment in this crucial period of implementing those goals.\nOn this point, I should like, therefore, to make a few observations – and, indeed, express a few reservations – regarding the detail of the message contained in the report. If I am naturally very broadly in agreement with the content of this report, I am all the same a little surprised by the mixed message that the report sends out to the world regarding the European Union’s performance as a donor. I should like to point out that the European Union is - and let us not forget this - the main provider of development aid, in terms of volume as well as in terms of percentage of gross domestic income: we devote EUR 100 per head to it, compared with the figures of only EUR 69 contributed by Japan and of EUR 53 contributed by the United States. This is not a reason for wallowing in blissful self-satisfaction, of course, because progress is obviously possible and necessary in this area. Such progress is, moreover, planned as the European Union is committed to it through the European Consensus on Development.\nThe report laments the fact that the increase in aid from certain Member States results partly from debt cancellation. I agree, of course, with the thrust of this remark or this reservation. Having said that, even leaving aside debt relief, aid from the European Union has increased, which is not the case where the other major donors are concerned. We are, nonetheless, obviously sensitive to this argument, and that is why the Commission has invited the Member States to establish, by the end of the year, a national schedule showing the budget increases that will allow the Member States to achieve their development aid objectives by 2010.\nMoreover, we must not underestimate either the effectiveness measures or the multiplier effect of dividing the work between the Commission and the Member States. Nor must we underestimate the value of aligning ourselves with the strategies and procedures of partner countries or, still less, the growing recourse to budget support, which is considerable. In these areas too, the European Union is in a position of undisputed leadership. I note, however, a certain unease regarding budget support which, nevertheless, is the preferred instrument of partnership, reflecting confidence between partners who are equal in terms of rights and duties. By supporting national policies and involving ourselves in the budget process, we are putting in place the instrument best suited to appropriation by the partner countries, an arrangement that also offers greater predictability and exceptional flexibility. Of course, it is still possible to improve the mechanism. That is the purpose of the contract for the Millennium Goals on which the Commission is currently working - a matter on which I touched briefly yesterday when I replied in committee to our colleague, Mr van den Berg - and we shall be able, in the weeks ahead, to discuss with you the criteria and the conditions of this contract for the Millennium Goals.\nThose are just a few remarks. Otherwise, I believe that it is vital to join forces in pursuit of the Millennium Goals. Thanks to our approach, developing countries will receive a clear message of solidarity from the European Union, which can only be a support to them in expressing their own determination.\nIn conclusion, I must thank Mrs Kinnock for this very significant report and congratulate her on it. It does put the issues in their proper context. It is an extremely useful contribution and a constant source of inspiration for the work of the Commission.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Louis Michel, Member of the Commission .
