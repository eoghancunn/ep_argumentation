{"speaker": "Linda McAvan (PSE). –", "english": "Linda McAvan (PSE). – Mr President, I want to talk about the G8 Summit and make two points. The first is on climate change. This was good news, because the US agreed to stay within the UN process, but bad news that no binding targets were agreed and worse news, in a way, that we made no progress on getting the emerging economies, like India, Brazil and China, within the process.\nCommissioner, we have a lot of work to do in the run-up to Bali. I know you are not the lead Commissioner for climate change, but as the Commissioner for Development, you have a key role to play in keeping the momentum on climate change going because, as you know, the poor in the developing world are already paying the price of climate change. Therefore, I hope you will be putting that at the top of your agenda.\nWhile the poor pay the price, if we look at the other key aspect of the G8, foreign aid, we see that the rich pay lip service. Looking at the figures, we see that the G8 is way off track on aid to the developing world and, amongst those, EU countries are some of the worst performers.\nCommissioner, my theory is that we will be back here in two or three years’ time, lamenting yet again the failure to make progress on foreign aid. The pledge to double aid was made at an EU summit. Are you keeping a scoreboard on this, or do we have to rely on NGOs to give us the score? In fact, we should be looking at scoreboards on climate change and on aid, because what Mr Mitchell said earlier about credibility and the EU is correct. People out there will judge us on how we perform on the issues they really care about: tackling climate change and poverty. The Constitution issue is important to us, but not to the public. Therefore, unless we deliver on those issues, we will not have much credibility with the outside world.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Linda McAvan (PSE). – Mr President, I want to talk about the G8 Summit and make two points.
