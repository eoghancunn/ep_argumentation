    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the dialogue between the Commission, the Member States and the professional bodies of professional services providers aimed at dismantling barriers to competition which are unjustified or harmful to the pursuit of the general interest and rules which are against the interests of consumers and ultimately of the providers themselves;\n",
        "2.  Calls on all those involved in the reform process to pursue it in a constructive manner;\n",
        "3.  Considers that the traditional right to issue regulations based on traditional, geographic and demographic specificities should be reduced and ultimately eliminated; emphasises in this connection that the rules should be non-discriminatory on the basis of gender, ethnicity or nationality and should restrict competition to the least extent possible in order to help attain the Lisbon targets;\n",
        "4.  Encourages Member States constructively to examine the practical experience of other Member States in the process of reforming professional services so as to derive the maximum possible benefit for their own reform endeavours;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the Commission to ensure that treaty provisions on the protection of competition and the internal market are properly observed in the liberal professions sector;\n",
        "6.  Takes the view that the effective and transparent self-regulation or regulation of service providers which anticipates the consequences of intervention, monitors their impact and fine-tunes them, where necessary, is an appropriate means of meeting the requirements of the Lisbon Strategy; considers that the Member States should be responsible for monitoring the scope of national self-regulation to prevent it damaging consumer interests or the pursuit of the general interest;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Member States to ensure access and mobility with regard to professional services and to ease transition from university and post-graduate education to professions;\n",
        "8.  Considers it necessary, in order to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises and increase the capacity for innovation and competitiveness of professional services, that restrictions on the scope for cooperation be eliminated and the setting up of inter-professional service providers be facilitated;\n",
        "9.  Considers it important to improve ethical standards and consumer protection in the field of professional services and supports the adoption of codes of conduct by professional service providers to be drawn up with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders;\n",
        "10. Points out that special regulations in the field of advertising can be largely dispensed with and that such regulations should in future be limited to duly justified exceptional cases; also points out that the continuity of special regulations in the field of advertising should be limited to duly justified exceptional cases and that the reduction of regulation should be aimed at enabling professionals to inform users of the services they offer via advertising, providing consumers with information on their professional qualifications and specialisations, and on the nature and cost of the services offered;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission to show which effects in terms of new jobs and additional growth can be expected from a systemic pro-competitive reform of the sector;\n",
        "12. Urges the Commission to examine more carefully the differences in the extent to which the various professional categories in each Member State have opened up the market and the expected impact of the full removal of unnecessary obstacles to competition, including an assessment of the expected impacts on professional sectors that have limited resources or that are restricted to certain regions;\n",
        "13. Encourages the Commission to broaden the scope of its analysis as regards the subdivision of regulatory protection by category of consumer group by looking more closely at small and medium-sized undertakings and taking into account the fact that demand for professional services from public authorities is not homogenous, but comes from many small units acting independently and at different levels of intensity, an aspect which should be studied more closely;\n",
        "14. Points out that the subdivision of regulatory protection according to individual categories of consumer overlooks the fact that rules derive their legitimacy from the fact that externalities may appear in the provision of professional services and that certain professional services may be deemed to be public goods;\n",
        "15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
