{"speaker": "Franco Frattini,", "english": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission . (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make just a brief observation after having listened to many speeches which I endorse. First, Mrs Breyer, I would like to tell you that I have always considered and will always consider polygamous marriage to be against the law and a serious violation of the right of women to choose freely. I can therefore confirm to you that I will continue to move in this direction.\nSome of the Members who have spoken – Mrs Angelilli and Mrs Morgantini – have raised the issue of communication. I believe – if I may say so – that giving a voice to immigrant women in a more direct and stronger way can be of great help, even in drawing up stronger European defence policies. ‘Giving a voice’ means allowing these people to have effective means at their disposal to be able to speak and to be listened to. Otherwise, there is a risk – if I may say so – that the voices of these women may also be subject to a filter operated by the communities in which they reside.\nIn many European countries cases of personal segregation and submission of immigrant women have been observed. This is the group, among the many with which I work, from which I receive the lowest number of individual complaints. When compared with other sectors connected with the protection of people’s fundamental rights, individual violence against women in immigrant communities is the area in which the fewest complaints about specific cases are received. Why? Because there is a fear of reporting such cases, because they are never communicated, because the women themselves are subjected to violence so that they do not disclose the abuses that they are suffering within the free and democratic territory of the Member States. Communication is therefore an absolutely central issue.\nFinally, precisely to help this integration effort, I would like to point out that in Spring 2007 I will be publishing a European manual on integration, which will be issued in all the languages spoken in the countries of the European Union, containing descriptions of cases of successful integration in the cities, provinces and regions where they have been found. By distributing millions of copies of this practical manual, we will publicise positive examples so that they can be imitated. These are examples coming from the world of local bodies. I can inform you that up to now the sector for which I have the least information is precisely that of the integration of immigrant women.\nI am therefore appealing to you, so that in the coming months I may receive specific examples, both positive and negative, on which I can take action. Otherwise, we will carry on making important statements of principle without being able to translate them into practical action, something that I, however, intend to do.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .
