However, we need to achieve that objective in a balanced way and in a common-sense way, so that we protect human health without penalising agriculture.\nWhat we do not want is to put restrictions in place that impact negatively on European agriculture and to end up having to import huge quantities of food with all the implications for food miles, and, of course, with little control over the quantities of pesticides used in the production of that imported food.\nSecondly, I support the proposal for a risk-based assessment, which is based on science and will prove workable for Member States.\nFinally, I believe a 10-metre buffer zone is a ‘one size fits all’ solution and needs to be modified to allow Member States to take local conditions into consideration. As I said earlier, not even the European Parliament can legislate for climatic conditions and soil conditions throughout the entire continent.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on these three reports.\nFirstly, I believe that we in Europe need to be in a position whereby we can produce European crops and European fruit and vegetables that are safe for human consumption.
