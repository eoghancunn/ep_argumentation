Currently it would appear that while there is some monitoring for residues on food products, it may not be adequate to provide sufficient assurances to consumers of these products. Steps need to be taken to ensure that the measures foreseen under this legislation are enforced through effective monitoring.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE), in writing. –\nI support the thrust of this report as it enhances the current legislation governing plant protection products in a way that should give consumers more confidence about the foods that they eat, it should give those in direct contact with these products such as producers, farmers, suppliers with clearer guidelines in relation to the use of pesticides and in general, it will provide for the safe production of agricultural products in the EU.\nHowever, it is important to point out that increasing legislation in this area will only be effective if there are sufficient checks and monitoring in Member States.
