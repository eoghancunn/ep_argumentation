I think we can all agree that despite recent positive developments, the situation concerning women’s rights in Turkey needs to be improved. While progress has been made towards improving legislation, implementation remains a challenge and needs to be speeded up.\nWe are now looking forward to further positive developments and hope that the work of the European Parliament and the Commission will support this process. Last but not least, I would like to underline the importance of the participation of civil society in this effort.\nI shall briefly mention some figures which might be of interest to you. This is in relation to the funds allocated by the Commission. Combating domestic violence against women: EUR 2.968 million. Strengthening civil society in the pre-accession process: EUR 2.5 million. Establishing shelters for women subjected to domestic violence: EUR 8.5 million. Through these and many other activities the Commission will continue to support that which is focused upon in this report.\nLet me once again express my gratitude to the rapporteur for the excellent work which has been done.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Meglena Kuneva, Member of the Commission .
