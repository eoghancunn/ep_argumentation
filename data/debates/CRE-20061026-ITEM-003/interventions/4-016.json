{"speaker": "John Whittaker,", "english": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, here we are again telling the European Central Bank how to do its job! Not only is this against the spirit of the Treaty, which states that the ECB is independent, it is also largely a waste of time, because, as always, the ECB will listen politely but, quite rightly, take little notice. Indeed, the ECB has enough trouble of its own, without listening to this Parliament, in finding an interest rate that suits 12 different economies, soon to be more.\nThe one-size-fits-all problem does not go away. At the moment, the larger euro zone economies are enjoying slightly higher growth but, as Mr Trichet accepts, this is fragile. When it falters, his problem of choosing the right interest rate will become more critical. Effectively, the ECB will be forced into a choice between inflation in Germany or recession in southern Europe, with all the dire implications for government debts that this will entail.\nI wonder what advice this Parliament will be giving then.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, here we are again telling the European Central Bank how to do its job!
