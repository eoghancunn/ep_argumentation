{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis,", "english": "Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on her excellent report on this most important subject, which affects, either directly or indirectly, the lives of all citizens.\nNumerous studies tell us that juvenile delinquency is on the increase in Europe and this is a most depressing and worrying modern-day phenomenon, which seriously threatens our society’s future. Something must be done to stop and, if possible, reverse this trend.\nMrs Batzeli has dealt with the problem in detail covering areas of aetiology, prevention and treatment of delinquency. I consider the preventive approach to be of particular importance and, in this respect, the roles of the mother, the father, the family in general, the school and society are extremely relevant. At this point, I wish it to be noted that, in my view, it is not the role of women but of mothers that is of concern in this context. I also wish to point out that the role of the father is just as important and should perhaps be included in the title of the report.\nI also note with regret that this report was adopted at committee level by women only in what I understand, and I stand to be corrected on this, is an all-women committee. Why that is so in institutional and practical terms I fail to fully comprehend. Nonetheless, I would have expected more input from men in the committee deliberations on this report. Why this was not so, I do not know.\nIt seems that juvenile delinquency is, to some extent at least, a side effect of so-called modern living and the demands put on parents by their complex socio-economic needs. Perhaps in our hunger for wealth and for career promotion, which in most cases requires both the father and mother to be away from home for many – too many – hours every day, we parents have reduced the priority given to our children.\nOn the occasion of debating this report, it may be wise to urge parents to pause for a moment or two and consider deeply within themselves what is most important in their lives: a higher income or more time spent with their children?
