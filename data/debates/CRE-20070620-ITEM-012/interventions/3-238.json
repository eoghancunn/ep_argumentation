{"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I would like to bring to your attention a new report on juvenile delinquency published in Ireland in the last few weeks, which shows that four out of five young people in our detention schools have psychiatric problems. The Emotional Intelligence, Mental Health and Juvenile Delinquency Report was carried out by two academics from University College Dublin, and it is the first time that this type of research has been carried out anywhere in the world, so it is significant in terms of this debate. It shows that two thirds of all juvenile offenders suffer from conduct-disorder conditions such as ADHD. More than half are abusing drink and drugs; some began using cannabis and alcohol as young as nine years old and began taking cocaine when they were aged just 13.\nThe research shows that young people experience very high rates of psychiatric disorders, they engage in serious criminality and have significant deficits in emotional intelligence and cognitive ability. As I have said, it is significant because this is the first time such research has been carried out. Eight out of ten of the young boys in this research meet diagnostic criteria for at least one serious psychiatric disorder.\nThe researchers identified that these young people had, on average, experienced three psychiatric disorders. This equates to almost three times as many disorders among boys who had been referred to a psychiatric service because of the difficulties they were experiencing.\nUnfortunately, the difficulties highlighted by this research are not addressed in our current service provision for these young people. The vast majority fail to receive any treatment for the problems they have, and this report highlights – and I would say this applies across Europe as well – the importance of addressing these difficulties. In addition to reducing the effects that mental health problems have on children’s functioning and development, treatment will lead to a significant reduction in offending behaviour and criminality and, therefore, has significant benefits for society and the legal system – in Ireland and, certainly, in the EU as a whole – so I would recommend this research to the House.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.
