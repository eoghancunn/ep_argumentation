{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, this report makes grim reading. More teens are getting involved in delinquency at a younger age and their actions are more brutal. This is so serious for the young people involved and for everyone in society that we have to find solutions, but we have to be accurate in our analysis of the problem.\nThe report includes a list of the critical formative influences on children: families, schools, friends and socioeconomic circumstances. In the interests of accuracy, I would add to this list: mass media and telecommunications, by which I mean movies, television, computer games and the internet – and, now, the new mobile phone technologies.\nStudies show that children spend more time with the mass media than with all the other influences put together. Articles 13 and 17 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is cited as the first authority in this report, seem to give children an absolute right to mass media and telecommunications and to give mass media and telecommunications absolute access to children. With their present content of violence, hatred, racism and pornography, and their use by child predators – all possible contributors to delinquency – should we see the mass media as having this absolute right and children having such an absolute right?\nIf any of the other influences on this list, such as family or school, were abusing or damaging children, we would remove the child for their safety. As we implement the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child in the EU and in Members States, we must rethink Articles 13 and 17. They were written in 1989, when people did not understand what the internet would be like in 2007.\nWe must also look at the role of fathers. Psychologists tell us that mothers give a child a sense of their own identity and their identity in the family, whereas fathers socialise the child and help them to know acceptable behaviour.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, this report makes grim reading.
