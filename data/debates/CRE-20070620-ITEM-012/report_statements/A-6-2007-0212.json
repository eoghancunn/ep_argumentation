        "1.  Stresses that juvenile delinquency can be effectively combated only by adopting an integrated strategy at national and European level which will mesh three guiding principles: prevention, the social inclusion of all young people, and legislative management measures;\n",
        "2.   Stresses that it is crucially important for all stakeholders in society to be directly involved in the planning and implementation of an integrated national strategy i.e., the State as central administration, regional and local authorities, educational institutions, the family, NGOs and especially youth NGOs, civil society and every individual; maintains that it is essential to have adequate financial resources available in order to implement effective measures to combat juvenile delinquency;\n",
        "3.   Maintains that effective combating of juvenile delinquency calls for an integrated and effective school, social, family and educational policy which will help to ensure that social and civic values are passed on and that young people adjust to society at an early age; considers that there is also a need for a policy geared to greater economic and social cohesion and to reducing social inequalities and countering social exclusion and poverty, with particular reference to child poverty;\n",
        "4.  Considers that the prevention of juvenile delinquency should be organised at three basic levels: primary prevention directed at all citizens, secondary prevention directed at occasional or potential juvenile offenders and, finally, tertiary prevention directed at persistent juvenile offenders, in a bid to put an end to such behaviour;\n",
        "5.  Considers it necessary to establish a series of concrete restrictions and benchmarks that families, educators and society must convey to young people from their infancy;\n",
        "6.  Considers that preventing juvenile delinquency also requires state policies in other areas, including housing, employment, vocational training, leisure occupation and youth exchanges;\n",
        "7.  Recalls that families, schools and society in general must work together to combat the growing phenomenon of juvenile violence;\n",
        "8.  Draws the attention of the Member States to the specific role the family plays in all stages of this fight against juvenile delinquency and asks them to develop adequate support for parents;\n",
        "9.  Encourages the Member Sates to ensure that their national policies include provision for one-year parental leave which would enable families which so wish to devote particular attention to the initial upbringing of their child (which is of such great importance to a child’s emotional development);\n",
        "10. Calls on the Member States to give particular assistance to families with financial and social problems; takes the view that measures to cover essential needs in terms of housing, food, guaranteed access to basic education and medical care for all family members, in particular children, together with action to ensure access on equal terms to the employment market and to social, economic and political activities for family members will ensure a healthy and equitable family environment for children’s development and their initial steps towards social integration;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Member States to provide resources for the expansion of an efficient psychosocial advice service, including contact points for problem families affected by juvenile delinquency;\n",
        "12. Stresses the particular importance of schools and school communities in shaping the character of children and adolescents; stresses that, if the education system fails to provide suitable channels for intervention, assistance and contact with students, two fundamental characteristics of present-day schools, multiculturalism coupled with an increased distinction between social classes, may lead to violence within schools and generate a climate of hostility between, on the one hand, the more aggressive pupils who indulge in bullying, and on the other, the pupils who become their victims;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Member States in this context to issue the education authorities with the necessary guidelines regarding an up-to-date approach to conflict management at school by means of conciliation procedures involving pupils, parents, teachers and local authorities;\n",
        "14. Considers it essential to provide special training for teachers in the management of heterogeneous classes, enabling them to develop an educational approach based not on moralising but on prevention and solidarity, avoiding the stigmatisation and marginalisation of both juvenile perpetrators and victims among their pupils;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Member States in addition to include within their educational policies the provision of special counselling and psychological support for children encountering problems of social integration, the availability of medical care in each school and the appointment of social workers, sociologists/criminologists, child psychologists and experts in issues relating to juvenile delinquency, each serving a small number of educational institutions, close checks on alcohol and drugs consumption among pupils, measures to combat all forms of discrimination against members of the school community, the appointment of a community ombudsman acting as intermediary between the school and the community and cooperation between various school communities in drawing up and implementing programmes to prevent violence;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Member States and the relevant national and regional authorities to implement strictly and fully Community and national legislation on the monitoring of television broadcasting and other content possibly of a particularly violent nature or unsuitable for juveniles; calls on the Member State authorities to reach agreement with the media on a 'road map' upholding the rights of the child and in particular those of juvenile offenders, involving a ban on the broadcasting of extremely violent images at certain times of the day and prohibiting the revelation of the identity of those involved in juvenile delinquency;\n",
        "17. Recommends that the Member States improve the quality of youth centres and enhance their role as a meeting place for young people and observes that the admission of juvenile offenders to such centres would facilitate their social reintegration and encourage a feeling of being a valuable member of society;\n",
        "18. Stresses that the media can play an important role in preventing juvenile delinquency by providing information and increasing public awareness as well as by means of high quality broadcasts, focusing on the positive contribution that young people make to society while at the same time monitoring broadcasts involving violence, pornography or drugs under 'road map' agreements to protect the rights of children;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Member States to update judicial and legislative procedures in respect of juvenile delinquency, moving towards decriminalisation, depenalisation and a lessening of the jurisdiction of courts and other institutions; recommends in this connection reducing to an absolute minimum actions punishable by deprivation of freedom and partial or total custodial sentences for juveniles, replacing them with a wide range of alternative educational measures at the discretion of the national courts, such as community service, reparation and mediation with victims, vocational training, road safety instruction and special counselling regarding drugs dependency and alcohol addiction;\n",
        "20. Urges the Member States to adopt new innovatory legal measures in response to the problem, such as the direct involvement in the criminal proceedings of the parents or guardians of juveniles from prosecution up to the implementation of sentences, accompanied by education and intensive psychological support measures, placing juveniles with foster families where considered necessary, together with support, in the form of advice and information, for parents, teachers and pupils in connection with violent behaviour by juveniles at school;\n",
        "21. Points out that in the case of juvenile delinquency the conduct and the duration of the judicial proceedings, the choice of the measure to be adopted and the subsequent implementation thereof must be guided by the principle of the overriding interest of the child and observance of procedural law; stresses in this connection that imprisonment must be ordered only as a last resort and that any prison sentence must be served in facilities suitable for juvenile delinquents;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Member States, in the framework of an integrated approach to juvenile delinquency to earmark separate budget appropriations specifically for measures to prevent juvenile delinquency, increase funding for social and workplace integration for young people and for the improvement and modernisation of central and regional facilities for juvenile offenders and for the provision of specialist and ongoing training for all individuals involved in a professional capacity and all organisations concerned;\n",
        "23. Urges the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, to draw up and adopt immediately a number of minimum standards and guiding principles common to all Member States in relation to juvenile delinquency to focus on the four basic pillars of prevention, rehabilitation, social integration or reintegration and judicial or non-judicial measures, on the basis of the principles internationally established under the Beijing rules and the Riyadh guidelines, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international conventions in this field;\n",
        "24. Maintains that the objective of a common European approach should be to define models for intervention to deal with and manage juvenile delinquency, while recourse to custodial measures and punishment should constitute the last resort and be implemented only when judged to be absolutely necessary;\n",
        "25. Notes that the inclusion and participation of young people in all issues and decisions concerning them is vital if common solutions are to be found that will prove successful; considers, therefore, that care should be taken when appointing youth court jurors to ensure not only that they have experience in youth education but also that they are trained in problems linked to violence and young people;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to lay down specific criteria for all Member States for the collection of national statistics in order to ensure that they are comparable and therefore usable during the planning of measures on a European scale; calls on the Member States to take an active part in the Commission's work by motivating and obtaining information from all of the competent national, regional and local authorities, associations, NGOs and other civil society organisations operating in this field;\n",
        "27. Calls uponthe Commission and the Member States’national and localauthorities to learn from thebest practices in operation within the EU countrieswhich activate the whole of society and include positive action and intervention on the part of parents' associations in schools and neighbourhood residents, and to assess the experiments conducted in the Member States in respect of cooperation agreements between police authorities, educational establishments, local authorities, youth organisations and social services at local level (with due regard to the rule of shared confidentiality), together with national strategies and national youth programmes; calls upon the Member States to learn from the best practices currently in operation within those States in order to combat the worrying increase in drug consumption by juveniles and in the related delinquency, and from the best solutions to be applied in the event of problematic consumption, with particular regard to healthcare;\n",
        "28. Welcomes national initiatives that include positive integration measures such as the 'out-of-school youth worker scheme' now being launched in regions such as La Rioja;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Commission and the Member States as an initial measure to develop existing European resources and programmes encompassing measures to cope with and prevent juvenile delinquency and facilitate satisfactory social reintegration of perpetrators and victims, examples being:\n",
        "30. Stresses that one means of preventing and combating juvenile delinquency is to develop a communication policy that will publicise the issues, put an end to violence in the mass media and promote audiovisual media whose scheduling is not exclusively centred on violent programmes; calls, in this connection, for European standards placing restraints on the promotion of violence in both broadcast and print media to be laid down;\n",
        "31. Notes that the Television Without Frontiers Directive (Directive 89/552/EEC)[6]sets strict limits regarding the broadcasting of violent images or, more generally, images unsuitable for the education of children, a measure designed to prevent violence by and against juveniles; calls on the Commission to take further steps in this direction, extending existing obligations to cover mobile telephony and the Internet, something which should be one of the fundamental political priorities in connection with the above Commission communication on the rights of the child;\n",
        "32. Welcomes the entry into force of the self regulatory framework for European companies concerning the safer use of mobile telephones by juveniles and children and accordingly stresses the need for the Commission to make specific proposals binding at European level to ensure safety awareness and vigilance with regard to Internet navigation and the use of mobile telephones;\n",
        "33. Calls on the Commission to set up immediately a European Juvenile Delinquency Observatory, the purpose of which will be to collect and make a comparative assessment of statistics from all the Member States, disseminate experience and good practices, plan and promote innovative initiatives and programmes at international, inter-regional and Community level, provide advisory support, organise seminars with the participation of the national authorities and, finally, organise technical and scientific cooperation on matters relating to personnel training and the exchange of professionals; stresses that effective action by this European Observatory depends on the effective activation and operation of national observatories with corresponding responsibilities;\n",
        "34. Calls on the Commission to continue its work on setting up a free Europe-wide telephone hotline for children and young people with problems, since such hotlines can make a significant contribution to preventing juvenile delinquency;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission, once the necessary studies have been completed at European level, to propose an integrated Community framework programme with Community preventive measures, support for NGO initiatives and transnational cooperation and the funding of pilot programmes at regional and local level, which will be based on best national practices, will attempt to disseminate these practices throughout Europe and will also cover social and educationalinfrastructure requirements;\n",
        "36. Stresses that there are two basic lines of action by the Community which should be drawn up immediately:\n",
        "37. Calls on the Commission in this context to draw up a programme of co-funded measures, to include:\n",
        "38. Urges the Commission, in preparing the way for the European Juvenile Delinquency Observatory and the related framework programme, to propose immediately the following measures for the promotion and dissemination of experience and know-how:\n",
        "39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.\n"
