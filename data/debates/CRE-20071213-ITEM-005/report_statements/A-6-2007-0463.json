    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Considers that a successful outcome of the DDA remains the EU's trade priority and would be concerned if bilateral negotiations with Korea or other partners were to distract from the achievement of this objective;\n",
        "2.  Believes that bilateral negotiations with major trading partners or regions can usefully supplement the multilateral rule book provided they produce ambitious, high quality agreements that go well beyond tariff reductions;\n",
        "3.  Considers that the size and rapid growth of the Korean economy makes it a suitable candidate for such an agreement but draws attention to the significant problems – including substantial NTBs – that will need to be addressed in order to reach a satisfactory agreement;\n",
        "4.  Believes that an agreement limited to tariff reductions would merely produce short term benefits and therefore demands the dismantling of NTBs as well as the opening of the services sector in Korea;\n",
        "5.  Considers that any FTA with Korea should take account of the four so-called Singapore Issues (foreign investment, competition, transparency in public procurement and trade facilitation);\n",
        "6.  Concludes that the mutually beneficial content of the agreement is far more important than a rapid timetable and would therefore be concerned if artificial deadlines were to lead to an agreement that was not wide ranging, ambitious and well balanced;\n",
        "7.  Considers that environmentally friendly products should have their tariffs reduced more quickly and more sharply than other goods; calls on the Commission and the Korean negotiators to produce a clear definition of such products; strongly recommends that, in such a definition, the goods' environmental conditions of production are duly taken into account;\n",
        "8.  Regrets that a Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) has not been produced at an earlier stage given the planned negotiating timetable; considers it of utmost importance that the results of the SIA be published well ahead of the signing of an agreement and that sufficient time be allowed for full public consultation so that the SIA's results can influence the outcome of the negotiations; calls on the Commission to consult the Parliament, the Council and civil society if the SIA study suggests mitigation requirements and to negotiate the final FTA accordingly;\n",
        "9.  Believes that the Commission’s level of ambition with regard to increasing market access should be balanced by an equally ambitious approach to sustainable development; also insists that there must be no exceptions to the rule that access to the internal European market is conditional on compliance with environmental protection standards;\n",
        "10. Welcomes the introduction of stronger social and environmental clauses in the recently concluded US-Korea FTA as the result of pressure from the US Congress;\n",
        "11. Considers that EU negotiators must see this as a base from which further progress can be made, particularly with regard to the ratification and enforcement of core International Labour Organization standards, Korea’s involvement in a post-2012 regime for combating climate change and recognition of existing EU environmental standards and legislation;\n",
        "12. Calls for any trade agreement with Korea to incorporate binding social and environmental clauses;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Member States and the Commission, during the bilateral negotiations with Korea, to support and promote the OECD guiding principles on corporate social responsibility (CSR), both for Korean enterprises operating in Europe and European enterprises established in Korea;\n",
        "14. Considers an ambitious Sustainable Development chapter to be an essential part of any agreement but recalls that the ultimate objective is the enforcement of agreed standards; takes the view that this requires the chapter to be subject to the standard dispute settlement mechanism;\n",
        "15. Believes that a Trade and Sustainable Development Forum, made up of representatives from workers’ and employers’ organisations and from NGOs, could play a valuable role in ensuring that greater market opening is accompanied by rising environmental and social standards;\n",
        "16. Proposes that a mechanism be established whereby recognised EU or Korean workers’ and employers’ organisations should be able to submit requests for action which would be treated within a specified time period and could result in ongoing follow-up and review provisions, in order to maintain pressure against violations of workers' rights;\n",
        "17. Calls for the conclusion of an FTA with Korea that covers trade in goods and services, makes scientific and technical cooperation and intellectual property an essential element of bilateral agreements, promotes cooperation on energy efficiency, is against climate change and includes provisions on other external aspects of energy policy, nuclear and renewable energy sources and the Galileo programme;\n",
        "18. Considers that Korea’s divergence from international norms and labelling requirements constitute major NTBs which present particular problems for the automotive, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and electronics industries; calls on the Korean government to provide satisfactory explanations for such divergences or, otherwise, to commit during the FTA negotiations to remove them;\n",
        "19. Supports the Commission’s objective of assisting EU exporters of pharmaceutical products and medical devices by ensuring greater transparency in the Korean healthcare system but insists that the Agreement should not create any legal or practical obstacles to Korean firms using the flexibilities set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the declaration on the TRIPs agreement and public health, adopted on 14 November 2001 in Doha, to promote access to medicines in developing countries;\n",
        "20. Emphasises that a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) should be incorporated in the EU-Korea FTA to further eliminate trade obstacles caused by unnecessary duplicate procedures performed by Korea which pose obstacles for EU companies within various industries wanting to sell their products to Korea;\n",
        "21. Regrets that Korea’s failure to follow international norms leads to animals being subject to unnecessary, duplicative tests; considers that the Agreement should seek to ensure that scientifically validated alternatives to animal testing that have been approved by one party should be presumed acceptable to the other party;\n",
        "22. Is concerned that the EU-Korea FTA could have a severe negative impact on the European automotive industry; requests therefore that the Commission considers a strategy of phasing out EU import tariffs with safeguards; recommends that this phasing-out shall be connected with the lifting of major NTBs on the Korean side;\n",
        "23. Notes, with regard to the automotive industry, that Korea has signed and ratified the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Agreement on Establishing of Global Technical Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be fitted and/or be used on Wheeled Vehicles, and has thus committed itself to implementing the standard regulations; calls on the Commission to insist on their rapid implementation; at the same time calls on the Commission to insist that EU automobiles complying with UNECE standards can be imported into Korea without testing or homologation; opposes provisions exempting Korean vehicles from anti-pollution emission standards;\n",
        "24. Considers that, in the light of the EU's problematic experiences with the Korean shipbuilding industry, special attention should be given to this sector in the negotiations;\n",
        "25. Considers that during the negotiations the Commission should also take into account the concerns of both the Korean and European agricultural sectors, particularly as regards the possible adverse effects of the FTA on the sensitive products concerned;\n",
        "26. Regards the tariff peak and excessive labelling requirements faced by the distilled spirits industry to be a priority for the negotiations; calls for measures to be taken immediately to combat the NTBs affecting fruit and vegetables and the excessively high tariffs applied to canned fruit; considers the achievement of a satisfactory outcome with respect to Geographical Indicators to be of utmost importance;\n",
        "27. Is concerned about the difficulties foreign firms have in accessing the Korean market for services including banking, insurance and legal advice;\n",
        "28. Attaches high priority to the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights, including through the introduction of adequate penalties for counterfeiting and piracy; considers that special mechanisms of quick and efficient dispute settlement, in the context of existing WTO rules, should be included so that these and other unfair trade competitive practices can be dealt with adequately; states that the current negotiation with Korea on the IPR protection should not undermine legitimate policy goals such as access to medicines by going beyond the TRIPs Agreement obligations, but that it should instead encourage the use of TRIPs' flexibilities;\n",
        "29. Urges South Korea to introduce public performance rights for producers of sound recordings in line with the Rome Convention, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996 and the Directive 2006/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property[4].;\n",
        "30. Calls on South Korea to fully comply with the WIPO Internet Treaties including: full legal back-up for technological protection measures used by copyright owners, including a prohibition against the act of circumvention; provide sound recording producers with exclusive rights over all forms of Internet dissemination; establish an effective notice and takedown procedure; recognition of protection for temporary copies and narrowing the private copying exception in the digital realm;\n",
        "31. Urges South Korea to strengthen the fight against Internet piracy by: improving incentives for cooperation by network providers in the fight against piracy; encouraging the Copyright Protection Centre to enforce consistently against online piracy of works of foreign right holders; investigating and prosecuting entities involved with illegal Internet sites, servers, storage services and file sharing services;\n",
        "32. Emphasises that any FTA with Korea should ensure the following: ·an improvement and simplification of Community rules on origin, ·broader harmonisation of existing international norms and standards instead of the introduction of new standards, ·more stringent disclosure requirements and the promotion of best practices in regulation, ·the transparency of national support mechanisms and the dismantling of existing NTBs;\n",
        "33. Recognises that the inclusion of goods from the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) raises serious legal and technical problems, and therefore considers that this would be fundamentally unacceptable so long as North Korea fails to uphold basic human rights standards and the principles inherent in the rule of law;\n",
        "34. Recommends that the Commission seriously examines the extent to which trade relations between North and South Korea affect a FTA with the EU;\n",
        "35. Emphasises that any agreement should include an undertaking not to lower labour standards in order to attract foreign investment in any part of the territory of the parties including export processing zones;\n",
        "36. Believes that, in order to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to multilateral negotiations, Korea should be ready to offer duty-free, quota-free access to Least Developed Countries (LDCs), following the example of the EU’s Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme and in full respect of equivalent labour and environmental standards;\n",
        "37. Considers that the legitimacy and public acceptability of an agreement requires that Parliament be closely involved in each stage of the negotiations and be given the chance to express its view on the acceptability of the negotiated text; expects the Commission and the Council to seek to present the agreement in a form that would require the assent of the Parliament under Article 300(3) second paragraph of the EC Treaty; 0 0   0\n",
        "38. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and to the government and parliament of the Republic of Korea.\n"
