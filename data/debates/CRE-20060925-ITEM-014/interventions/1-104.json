I hope that he will likewise accept the amendments that my colleague, Renate Sommer, has put forward, in the sense that Europe is at its best when it is sharing good practice. It is geared to sharing good practice between Member States and between local authorities. The amendments are intended to make sure that this is directed to them and that the Commission is not called on to do everything for them. If we can get that straight, then we will be able to support the very good ideas in the report as a whole.\nOur constituents are rightly worried about many aspects of the urban environment. We have just had a debate on air quality: that is very central to it. However, it is more than that; it is the noise that we have to put up with in the urban environment, from neighbours as well as from vehicles, from ghetto blasters and so on. This is not territory for European directives, but we can share best practice as to how to tackle it. Similarly, street cleaning and the sheer dirt of our cities are a public health issue that ought to be on our agenda. We can learn from each other. Just as one sees in Paris the gutters running with water at night to clean them, there are ideas all over Europe. We want to see the phasing-out of crime as part of our strategy for urban areas, with emphasis on designing estates which avoid those traps for citizens where they can be pounced on by wrongdoers, making sure that we have safe routes to railway stations, and so on. We must also ensure that we have sensible development alongside our rivers to avoid building on flood plains and the disasters that can cause.\nThere are many good ideas in this report with opportunities to share best practice and that is what could come from this. I hope the Commissioner will take it forward in that spirit.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I thank Mr Hegyi for his report and for accepting a number of amendments that I put forward.
