Sufficient support needs to be given to the development of public transport using sustainable energy sources. In Ireland alone, transport is the third largest contributor to CO2 emissions.\nBiofuels should represent 5.75% of our energy supply by 2010. In real terms, for example, again in my own country, Ireland, 70 000 fossil fuel-burning cars will be taken off the roads. Urban centres running public transport on biofuels have the opportunity to showcase the ease of use of those fuels, which will in turn increase demand from private companies such as taxis, and individual domestic use.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that it is only through a policy of integration in the areas of energy efficiency and environmental protection that realistic targets can be set and achieved for urban areas.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Seán Ó Neachtain (UEN), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism . – Mr President, as draftsman of this report on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I believe that the policy initiatives in the European Commission’s Green Paper on energy should be integrated into sustainable urban transport plans, particularly with respect to the promotion of biofuels.
