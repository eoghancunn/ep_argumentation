{"speaker": "Diana Wallis,", "english": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, this is an incredibly important multifaceted report, and it covers a very difficult bundle of European issues, not just the environmental. It is noteworthy that it comes to us via the route of the Committee on Petitions, and it is to the credit of that committee that it manages to bring together opinions from across the spectrum of this House, through hearings and this report, to try to get a synthesised view.\nThe guiding principle of my group in dealing with this report has been very much to try to adopt a European set of answers to European problems. Fundamentally, the pipeline underlines the need, if ever we needed it underlined, for a European approach to energy supply.\nIt is not appropriate that different countries do different things with different partners. We need a Community response which is underlined by the principle of solidarity.\nThere has been much said about the environment, and the Commissioner has given some good answers to do with European environmental law, international legal obligations, but we need to build confidence here; we need to ensure, as far as possible, that European standards are adhered to and that there is a coordinated, coherent European approach to the environmental issues.\nThen of course we come to the very difficult subject of EU-Russia relations. We have a golden opportunity here: in the Baltic Sea area, in the High North, we have the Northern Dimension Partnership. Let us use that vehicle, which has been one of the success stories of EU-Russia relations, to help us here.\nLastly I leave you with this positive thought. In my own constituency of Yorkshire there is a small village that is now linked with a small village in Norway by the largest undersea gas pipeline across and through the North Sea. That has built people-to-people relationships that will last for a very long time. That is positive.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, this is an incredibly important multifaceted report, and it covers a very difficult bundle of European issues, not just the environmental.
