    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Is of the opinion that Nord Stream is an infrastructure project with a wide political and strategic dimension for both the EU and Russia; understands the concerns expressed by EU Member States regarding the construction and maintenance of the pipeline; underlines that the ability of small littoral states to act as security providers in the Baltic Sea region cannot be seen in isolation from the EU's ability to act as a unified entity and to speak with one voice on energy issues, and recalls its resolution of 26 September 2007 on a common European foreign policy on energy[7]; underlines that Decision 1364/2006/EC (incorporating the TEN-E guidelines) recognises Nord Stream to be a project of European interest that would help to meet the EU’s future energy needs; stresses that this project, together with other complementary pipelines, such as the Yamal II and Amber, should be planned in the spirit of a common European foreign policy on energy and should take fully into account their impact on the environment and on the security of the EU Member States;\n",
        "2.   Reiterates its opinion that, taking into consideration the increasing dependence of the EU on a limited number of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes, it is essential to support initiatives aimed at their diversification, both geographically and by developing sustainable alternatives; draws attention in particular to the need to support the development of port infrastructure used for the handling of fuels; recalls that Nord Stream is only one of a larger number of gas infrastructure projects, such as pipelines and LNG facilities, which will be essential to meet the Community’s natural gas consumption needs that – according to numerous studies – will rise significantly over the coming years and at the same time will make it possible to replace less environmentally friendly fossil fuels; considers it necessary to assess the long-term impact on the environment of the new gas infrastructure, with regard to the importance of guaranteeing a stable gas supply;\n",
        "3.   Supports the proposal, contained in Parliament’s above-mentioned resolution of 14 November 2006, that the EU’s future marine strategy must result in binding supranational obligations which may involve common commitments in third countries;\n",
        "4.   Underlines that energy security must be regarded as an essential component of the overall security of the European Union, whereby the definition of energy security should not merely be limited to the lack of internal EU production but should also take into account the geopolitical aspects of dependency on imports and the potential therein for politically motivated interruptions; believes that the Third Energy Package will reduce each Member State's energy dependence as no state can be disconnected from a third-country supplier in a fully liberalised and integrated energy market;\n",
        "5.   Regrets the marginal role played by the EU in this project, in particular that of the Commission; points out that greater EU involvement would reduce the uncertainty felt by many Member States about the Nord Stream project;\n",
        "6.   Takes note of the opposition expressed by certain Member States to the pipeline project planned for the Baltic Sea area, which is a common asset of the states bordering the Baltic Sea, not a matter of bilateral relations between states; considers, therefore, that the project should be realised in cooperation with each of the states around the Baltic Sea in accordance with the Espoo Convention, the Helsinki Convention and other pertinent legal instruments;\n",
        "7.   Voices its opposition, in this connection, to the carrying-out of an investment on the proposed scale without the consent of all the littoral states first being obtained;\n",
        "8.   Expresses its conviction that energy projects involving EU Member States and third countries should be subjects of common European interest and concern for the whole European Union and for its citizens;\n",
        "9.   Acknowledges that Nord Stream has been carrying out the ongoing environmental impact assessment to be submitted to the “Parties of origin” as defined in the Espoo Convention (Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany) for their approval; urges the company to make the results of studies and the full set of research data concerning the ecological situation of the project site, collected during environmental investigations, available not only to those States, but also to HELCOM and to all interested parties;\n",
        "10. Emphasises that a long-term sustainable solution requires full transparency for all parties during both the construction and operating phases, and that confidence in this major project will be increased if the states bordering the Baltic Sea can monitor the work;\n",
        "11. Considers that the challenge of  securing energy supply while respecting the EU's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable development makes it imperative to implement a coherent and coordinated European policy on supply of natural gas based on careful evaluation at the European level of the environmental aspects of alternative solutions and on mutual solidarity between Member States;\n",
        "12. Calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Council to make a full commitment to analysing the environmental impact of the construction of the North European gas pipeline, particularly in situations involving considerations which require a Commission opinion, as specified in Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC;\n",
        "13.Emphasises that the reciprocity principle must be fully respected as regards investment if theinterdependencebetween the EU and Russia is to develop into a partnership; notes that third countries benefit to a great extent from Europe's open market, but also that European investors in Russia are not accorded similar advantages;\n",
        "14. Regrets the Commission’s failure to accept the proposal contained in Parliament’s resolution of 16 November 2006 concerning the preparation of objective environmental impact assessments of proposed projects by the Commission, while reiterating its call for the preparation of such an assessment by an independent body to be appointed with the approval of all the littoral states,\n",
        "15. Calls on the Council and the Commission to conduct a thorough assessment of the question whether the implementation of the project is in keeping with Community and international law;\n",
        "16. Expresses its concern at the project timetable adopted by Nord Stream, the implementation of which will prevent a thorough analysis of the results of the environmental impact assessment by interested states, non-governmental organisations and HELCOM experts;\n",
        "17. Points out that dozens of months' work in an area of up to 2 400 km², requiring the use of a large number of vessels and other equipment, represents a serious threat to biodiversity and to the number of habitats, as well as to the safety and smooth operation of shipping, in the region;\n",
        "18. Regrets the absence of a precise definition of the extent of interference with the seabed required to bury the pipeline, which could have a critical impact on the benthic environment;\n",
        "19. Expresses profound concern at the reports that, before commissioning the gas pipeline, the investor intends to use a highly toxic compound known as glutaric aldehyde; underlines that any action that would result in a major environmental disaster with irreversible consequences should be avoided;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to conduct a reliable and independent environmental study examining the agricultural and industrial emissions polluting the Baltic Sea and to evaluate the situation in proportion to possible environmental threats caused by the pipelines currently crossing the Baltic Sea; in addition, calls on the Commission to evaluate the additional impact on the Baltic Sea caused by the Nord Stream project;\n",
        "21. Calls on the developer to ensure that the construction and operation of the pipeline does not endanger the many species of fish and birds as well as the existence of a population of porpoises numbering only 600, which are a species unique to this geographical region;\n",
        "22. Considers that the protection of the marine environment of the Baltic Sea is a component of the Northern Dimension of the EU;\n",
        "23. Notes that the prosperity of coastal regions and the competitiveness of their economies are highly susceptible to, and endangered by, spoilt coastal areas and the deterioration of the marine environment; points out that, given the extent to which coastal regions are affected by maritime activities and policies, long-term environmental sustainability is a precondition for the protection of their economic, social and environmental prosperity;\n",
        "24. Points out the absence of any strategy to address structural failure and external threats to the security of the pipeline; emphasises the need to clearly define all aspects related to security and emergency response, including financial resources, actors, roles and procedures;\n",
        "25. Emphasises that, given the serious environmental risks and the high cost of the proposed project, alternative gas pipeline routes should be analysed first, taking into account both environmental and economic aspects, including the timetable for such routes; notes that it is possible to run such routes to the Russian border overland, solely through European Union Member States;26.  Stresses that the issue of economic compensation for any failures or damage must be perfectly clear before work can even begin; points out that a major failure in the pipeline can lead to complications for the states bordering the Baltic Sea and would be devastating for the marine environment; considers that Nord Stream should assume full liability for compensation;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to undertake such an analysis in a dialogue with interested states, the investor and the Helsinki Commission, and with the participation of interested NGOs;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission and Member States to carry out a thorough assessment of the economic, budgetary and transparency-related aspects of the Nord Stream project and the firms involved in it; .\n",
        "29. Welcomes the following decisions made by authorities of the Member States:\n",
        "30. Regrets the fact that the Green Paper entitled ‘Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union’ does not address the problem of large-scale projects such as subsea pipelines;\n",
        "31. Calls for a truly independent environmental impact assessment to be commissioned, with the approval of all littoral states, while recognising the environmental impact assessment carried out by Rambøll;\n",
        "32. Regrets that in the legal instruments and communications concerning marine strategies initiated by it, the Commission usually passes over the problem of subsea pipelines, which is crucial from the point of view of both environmental protection and the EU’s energy security;\n",
        "33. Points out the importance of conducting a transparent communication strategy on steps concerning the results of the environmental impact assessment, and of communicating those results actively to all EU Member States, especially the Baltic littoral states;\n",
        "34. Reiterates, therefore, its call in its resolution of 14 November 2006 for the proposal of a mandatory mechanism for negotiation between Member States and its insistence that the Council take action at international level to develop mandatory environmental impact assessments in relations between the EU and third countries;\n",
        "35. Notes that routing the North European gas pipeline should meet the strategic and economic objectives set out in Decision 1364/2006/EC whilst avoiding extensive environmental damage;\n",
        "36. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to use every legal means at their disposal to prevent the construction of the North European gas pipeline on the scale proposed by the investor, should it become apparent that there is a risk of an environmental disaster in the Baltic Sea area;\n",
        "37. Calls on the Commission in particular to ensure compliance with the provisions of the documents referred to above, namely the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the helsinki Convention, the Espoo Convention, the Aarhus Convention and Directives 85/337/EEC, 97/11/EC, 92/43/EEC and 79/409/EEC, as well as Article 10 of the EC Treaty and the precautionary principle and the principle of sustainable development, and to initiate proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty in the event of failure to comply with the above obligations;\n",
        "38. Calls on the Commission in particular to take resolute action in line with the principle of good governance, which recognises that decision-making bodies enjoying a wide discretion are required to carry out a timely analysis of the actual state of affairs and, where necessary, to obtain expert opinion to prevent an arbitrary decision from being made;\n",
        "39. Calls on the Commission, within the scope of its competence, to evaluate the market competition situation caused by the possible completion of the Nord Stream pipeline, and if necessary to take measures to prevent Gazprom from assuming a dominant role on the EU gas markets without guaranteeing reciprocal rights for EU companies to enter the Russian energy market;\n",
        "40. Suggests the establishment of a system of common supervision of the pipeline, to include all countries in the Baltic Sea region; further suggests that the obligation to pay compensation for environmental damage should lie solely with Nord Stream;\n",
        "41. Notes the lack of institutional structures capable of responding adequately to the environmental and geopolitical security issues associated with this project; suggests, therefore, that the Commission should create an appropriate post to deal with current and future projects, functioning under the authority of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the Commission;\n",
        "42. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States.\n"
