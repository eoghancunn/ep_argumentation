That is why I welcome the support in the budget for research programmes and the development of new technologies, because without the development of such technologies, we cannot hope for competitiveness in our economy.\nI would also like to see this support being made available to all regions throughout Europe, not only in more urban areas, but also in rural communities. I would also like to see strong support for the CAP health check in the coming years in order to ensure a healthy food supply locally and not to have to depend on food imports from faraway lands.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Seán Ó Neachtain (UEN). – Mr President, the most important aspect of this budget is how it aids and supports the economy of Europe in its entirety, as well as developing and strengthening the economy – something which is really needed at present.
