{"speaker": "Charlie McCreevy,", "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions. In closing, I would like to make two key points.\nWe do not believe that regulatory change is appropriate at the current time. The directive has stood the test of time well. It is able to adapt to changing circumstances. In the longer term it will be crucial from a financial stability perspective for the positive guarantee schemes to contribute to smooth crisis management in an increasingly pan-European banking environment.\nAny further steps towards more harmonised schemes in the European Union now depend therefore on the outcome of the wider work that is currently being conducted in the context of crisis management.\nConcerning the problems raised by both Ms Kauppi and Mr Hökmark, the reimbursement of contributions to a bank that leaves the scheme, for whatever reason, is not covered by the existing directive and is therefore a matter for Member State legislation. Harmonisation at European level would require full harmonisation of the funding method.\nI would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ehler, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their very constructive approach.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions.
