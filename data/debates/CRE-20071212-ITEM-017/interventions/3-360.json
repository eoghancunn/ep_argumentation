{"speaker": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for underlining the need for studies and analyses, but also concluding that, if there are distortions on the market, something has to be done in order to achieve a level playing field. I think it is important to conclude this from this debate.\nIf there are distortions, we can have different opinions – if they are there. But if they are there, something needs to be done. We need to do that because I think we all agree that we want more cross-border competition, and we also wish to secure the interests of the consumers.\nIt is relevant to discuss the difference between different systems, because if you have in some Member States ex-ante systems and in some Member States different ex-post systems, which in reality assumes that the state might bale out banks which cannot pay their customers, then you have a distortion.\nIt is my opinion that, due to the differences in opinion we have, there is a distortion already. The distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers.\nI think a good achievement with this report by Mr Ehler is that we have achieved that conclusion. I think it is important that the Commission respond to that in future actions.\nWe might have differences in opinion about how the state of play is today. But we do agree on the need for action to be taken if the studies to be done show that there are distortions.\nI would like to thank the rapporteur for that and also ask the Commissioner to respond to that with action.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for underlining the need for studies and analyses, but also concluding that, if there are distortions on the market, something has to be done in order to achieve a level playing field.
