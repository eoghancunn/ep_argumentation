    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Appreciates the importance of deposit-guarantee schemes and the benefits of the directive for users and the stability of the financial market; stresses, at the same time, the importance of eliminating possible market distortions, if these are verified by analysis;\n",
        "2.   Agrees with the Commission that legislative amendments to Directive 94/19/EC should be undertaken only after the results of further research, particularly in the field of cross-border risk and crisis management, have become available; considers it important to tackle serious distortions of competition if these are verified by analysis;\n",
        "3.   Considers that the minimum stipulated protection should be harmonised at a higher level, but that any increase should be closely linked to a corresponding economic development, particularly as some countries still remain, as a result of their macroeconomic conditions, below the minimum level of protection provided in the directive; makes it clear in this context, however, that a further decrease in the guarantee protection that is due to inflation should be stopped no later than when the Directive is next amended;\n",
        "4.   Supports the assessment of the Commission that the operation of deposit-guarantee schemes might be improved through self-regulatory, particularly cross-border, measures;\n",
        "5.   Welcomes, in this respect, the cooperation with the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI) and the JRC which was initiated by the Commission, and the wide-ranging dialogue aimed at drawing up self-regulatory measures which was instigated by the Commission;asks the Commission to inform Parliament of its time table and results in this respect;\n",
        "6.   Is of the opinion that more information needs to be provided to customers to enable them to make informed choices regarding the intermediaries to whom they are to entrust their savings, and that the approach should seek constantly to enhance the ability of intermediaries to operate on a cross-border basis and to promote market integration; believes that self-regulation and in particular the potential contribution of the EFDI could have an important role to play in this connection;\n",
        "7.   Considers that the various existing ways in which the deposit-guarantee schemes are financed should be examined, in the context of possible distortions of competition, including equal treatment of customers and the ensuing costs, and particularly of the effects on operation in the event of a cross-border crisis;\n",
        "8.   Highlights the fact that ex-post deposit-guarantee scheme systems should provide as much safety and security for the consumers as the ex-ante deposit-guarantee scheme systems;\n",
        "9.   Believes that a separation of supervision and deposit-guarantee scheme between countries creates regulatory problems; asks the Commission to analyse possible adverse effects of such a situation;\n",
        "10.  Considers that the waiting period for depositors to be reimbursed in a crisis situation could be substantially reduced, because of the considerable innovations in communications technologies which have taken place since the Directive was adopted; considers that improvements should primarily be aimed at those that do not require legislative provisions: through agreements, best practice, an improvement in data quality, and the clear allocation of responsibilities for data processing and self-commitments on the part of the banks;\n",
        "11. Considers it necessary where reimbursement emanates from two deposit guarantee schemes that the waiting period for the depositor to be reimbursed must not be longer for the reimbursement from the home country schemes than from the host country schemes;\n",
        "12. Endorses the approach whereby the decision relating to any refund or transfer of contributions made to the guarantee schemes by a credit institution should, in the event of a member leaving the deposit-guarantee schemes, be made by Member States;\n",
        "13. Supports the assessment of the Commission that new provisions for the transfer or refund of contributions to the guarantee schemes must neither weaken the functioning of the fund nor result in an inadmissible accumulation of risk;\n",
        "14. Is of the opinion that, in the long run, the question of harmonisation of deposit-guarantee schemes as regards their financing and competence and the role of the supervisory authority needs to be addressed if the requested analyses show distortions of competition, unequal treatment of customers or negative consequences on cross-border risk management;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the establishment of working groups from the Economic and Finance Committee and the Financial Services Committee to review and develop EU arrangements aimed at ensuring the stability of financial markets and to regulate supervision;\n",
        "16. Clearly states that the trend towards replacing subsidiaries with branch structures in the banking sector is also linked to new requirements for cooperation between the authorities in the Member States concerned in crisis situations;\n",
        "17. Believes it necessary for the Commission, together with the finance ministers of Member States, the central banks and the EFDI, to analyse the potential advantages and disadvantages of burden sharing before and after potential crisis situations arise, and to inform Parliament of its results;\n",
        "18. Considers it necessary for the procedures and interaction between all parties concerned in a potential cross-border crisis situation to be determined in advance, and for the Commission, together with representatives of the Member States, the central banks and the EFDI, to plan and determine procedures and cooperation and to inform Parliament accordingly;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to draw up standards to improve early- risk detection by the deposit-guarantee systems; sees an opportunity to use the early detection system to set risk-based contributions;\n",
        "20. Considers that it would be advisable to embark on the more exhaustive study necessary in order to determine a common risk assessment method;\n",
        "21. Clearly states that the principal responsibility for risk limitation lies with the banks;\n",
        "22. Considers it necessary to develop principles for cross-border risk and crisis management in order to reduce the free rider problem and the risk of moral hazard;\n",
        "23. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission.\n"
