{"speaker": "Claude Turmes,", "english": "Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, that is enough talk: let us act. Let us have mandatory targets above 20% and strengthen legislation, above all as regards transport, but also electricity. Let us take the opportunity to relaunch combined heat and power – that should be our answer to energy security. However, all this can only happen if there is institutional capacity-building. As long as there are more people in the Commission working for Euratom and on nuclear power then on energy efficiency, then there will be more talk than action.\nCommissioner, we will judge you on this. You promised us more staff to work on energy efficiency. You have not delivered on your promises and will not be able to do so without more staff. We need these staff because we need Commission officials to go outside Brussels and build a new partnership. Energy efficiency is about a new culture, and we must therefore get national, regional and local governments on board, as well as industry, NGOs and the citizens. How can you achieve this with just a handful of officials in the Commission?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, that is enough talk: let us act.
