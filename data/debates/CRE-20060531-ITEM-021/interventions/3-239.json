{"speaker": "Fiona Hall,", "english": "Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, this is a report brimming with recommendations, but I want to make just one point. We must not be under-ambitious on energy efficiency. We are dealing with an evolving set of circumstances, and the technology is developing so fast that last years’ top energy-efficient appliance becomes next year’s rather mediocre model. But even more significantly, the economic calculation is changing almost daily. As Mrs Rothe said, when the Commission published its Green Paper it based its target of 20% energy saving by 2020 on an oil price of USD 30 a barrel, but by the time the report passed through the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), oil prices stood at USD 70 a barrel.\nIt will not be very long before Member States bring forward their national energy efficiency action plans. As you said Commissioner, 1% a year now seems far too low a target to be aiming for. I welcome very much the comments you made to that effect.\nI hope that the Commission will take a strong line and ensure that those national action plans are ambitious both in scope and in implementation, given what is now realistically and viably achievable.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, this is a report brimming with recommendations, but I want to make just one point.
