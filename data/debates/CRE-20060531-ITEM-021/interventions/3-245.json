{"speaker": "Andris Piebalgs,", "english": "Andris Piebalgs, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report.\nWe touched upon the very important issue of the Commission’s role and whether the Commission is delivering. I do not believe that it is the role of the Commission to have millions of inspectors checking that everyone has switched off their lights! The role of the Commission is to give the political imperative, to provide the instruments for Member States and to raise public awareness, and we are delivering on that. We are coping excellently in this respect, because energy efficiency is definitely the first priority in the whole energy society in the European Union and each year we are improving, but we should like to improve even more. The perception that was mentioned is wrong, because the Commission is delivering strongly on this.\nLet me turn to the issue of staff and the relocation of staff. The Commission must fulfil Treaty obligations. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. The Treaties should be fulfilled and to do this the Commission must have enough staff for all areas. Therefore, it is not possible to move civil servants from one area to another as if by some miracle.\nAs far as energy efficiency is concerned, there have been changes to the structure of DG-TREN. We have a unit for energy efficiency and another for renewable energies. The number of staff has been increased and will be increased in accordance with the provisions in the annual budget. That is part of the budget-making procedure. I cannot accept this argument. The Commission is doing what it can and is delivering on it.\nThe report is excellent and will provide us with better opportunities to use the potential of the European Union. Perhaps we could be more ambitious than 20%, but we must now concentrate on seeing that is fulfilled.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Andris Piebalgs, Member of the Commission .
