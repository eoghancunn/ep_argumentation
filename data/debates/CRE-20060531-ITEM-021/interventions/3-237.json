In having too many words, there is a risk of losing focus on what we wish to achieve.\nHowever, I would like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras very much on the splendid set of amendments which he has produced with the other shadow rapporteurs in compromise. It is wonderful to see so much text being cut out of a report, and I support him strongly.\nWe need realism in pursuit of our aims for efficiency.
