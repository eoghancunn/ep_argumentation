        "1.     Welcomes the Commission’s decision to opt for a global, transversal approach to an issue which is as important for businesses as it is to workers and their social and working environment;\n",
        "2.      Agrees with the Commission that restructuring is not necessarily synonymous with social decline and a loss of economic substance provided that such measures are correctly anticipated, that firms can manage them quickly and effectively in dialogue with trade unions, thatanticipatory measures at business level together with public actionhelpensure that the change is carried out in sound conditionsand that businesses anticipate restructuring by means of ongoing training for their workers; considers that these conditions are not often present;\n",
        "3.      Considers that business restructuring should only take placeif warranted by the circumstances, namely in order to save jobs or improve the competitiveness and the economic development of firms, and should not be used to boost profitabilitythrough dismissals or for purely financial or speculative reasons, such as capital gains for pension or shareholder funds; considers that, faced with immoral or predatory tactics, the Commission should take advantage of the possibility of mediation at European level through a group of independent ombudsmen;\n",
        "4.      Notes that continual processes of adjustment to changing framework conditions are unavoidable if businesses are to develop; accordingly, considers it important – as the European social partners also noted in their joint document “Orientations for reference in managing change and its social consequences”– to explain in good time to workers and/or their representatives the need for changes, and to take the interests of the workers into account;\n",
        "5.       Considers that, in line with the European Economic and Social Committee’s above-mentioned opinion of 29 September 2005, while the success of restructuring is certainly measured in terms of businesses’ competitiveness and innovative capacity, it is equally measured in terms of job preservation and good social management of any negative consequences;\n",
        "6.       Considers that, since the European Union promotes the opening-up of the market, it also has a duty to put in place the necessary financial resources to anticipate better and accompany restructuring and mitigate its social consequences, as well as topromote innovation and the search for new entrepreneurial potential and the maintenance of working conditions;\n",
        "7.      Considers that the Union needs to rise to challenges of a global dimension, such as restructuring, by improving the competitiveness of Europe’s economy and businesses through better coordination and more consistent application of four existing Community instruments:\n",
        "8.     Agrees with the Commission that the ESF and, to a lesser extent, the ERDFin respect of SMEs undergoing restructuring, which are too often overlooked, have a crucial role to play in anticipating and managing restructuring; proposesthat the financial programmes under discussion for 2007-2013should be geared more closely to anticipating and managing restructuring, especially in areas where a high proportion of industry is accounted for by a limited number of sectors, and that the Funds will be allocated a budget adequate to this task;\n",
        "9.      Considers – in view of the unpredictability of some restructuring events and the difficulty of foreseeing their impact on the local area, and given the extent to which the Union’s policies are responsible for this – that a growth adjustment and contingency reserve should be set up, and welcomes in this connection the common position of the European Council; expresses the wish, moreover, that businesses will also be able to endow this reserve;\n",
        "10.    (a)Urges that the size of an undertakingin which restructuring has taken place or its geographical location within the Union should not be used as the soleselection criteria for potential EU aid and that appropriate account should also be taken of the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); (b) Urges that another criterion should be whether a firm includes provision for adjustment processes as part of its business planning, and in particular whether it is committed to initial and further training;\n",
        "11.     Considers that the EUis a very essential partner in assisting the conversion process in regions where restructuringhas occurred (industrial, tertiary, intersectoral, intrasectoral, etc.);\n",
        "12.   Calls on the European Union to support geographical mobility and mobility of employment in order to make better use of the available workforce of every category and, in particular, of young people, women and persons above 45 years of age, and calls upon the European Union to help remove administrative and linguistic barriers to mobility;\n",
        "13.  Suggests that environmental issues should be takeninto account in the context of European assistance during restructuring, in particular by promoting the conversion of industrial or agricultural processes to activities which are less polluting and hence less dangerous for the surrounding population and for the workers;\n",
        "14.  Notes, furthermore, that the first victims of restructuring are dismissed employees and that priority aid should be given to them in all cases, and to the economic activities dependent on the business undergoing restructuring, particularly sub-contracting SMEs; stresses the need to take better account of the ‘hidden effects’ of restructuring, such as those affecting workers’ health; notes that individuals directly threatened by redundancy suffer medical and psychological problems, and that, during the first five years following their dismissal, the mortality rate among such employees is twice as high as among those who are not dismissed; considers, therefore, that financial assistance should not be limited to the structural aspect of restructuring and that the human dimension of these challenges should be taken into account by prioritising personally-tailored assistance for workers;\n",
        "15.   Condemns also, among the hidden effects of restructuring, the early retiring of employees, who then, on account of their age, are the least employable, giving rise to significant financial costs to society, the loss of their professional skills and a senseless risk of labour shortage;\n",
        "16.   Calls for better monitoring and better traceability of the use of Community funds, so as to ensure that they are properly used, to prevent their being diverted to related, speculative or administrative purposesand to prevent their being used to fund relocations; calls in particular for firms subsidised from EU funds which relocate part or all of their activities within the EU to be barred from receiving any further Community aid for a given period of time and for them to be required possibly to reimburse aid so as to prevent subsidy tourism;\n",
        "17.  Reaffirms the essential character of the Community acquis in the social field and the importance in particular of existing legal instruments, which must be fully applied and better monitored by the Member States, who are responsible for their proper transposition and application. This concerns in particular the following:\n",
        "18. Regrets that the second phase consultation on the European Works Council is only a minor subchapter encompassed in a broader Commission Communication, and calls on the Commission, should the intention be to revise the current European Works Council, to launch a proper second phase consultation offering social partners the opportunity to negotiate in accordance with article 138 of the EC Treaty and with the principle of transparency.\n",
        "19. Shares the Commission’s opinion that the European social partners should occupy a central place in accompanying andmanagingrestructuringwith a view to promoting worker mobility in Europeandtheputting in place of structures forlifelong learning where appropriate;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to continue to work towards a Community framework for the protection of workers’ rights in the event of restructuring; notes in this connection the work already undertaken by the social partners and calls on them to find ways of applying the good practices they have identified;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to put in place, in accordance with the spirit of the Lisbon Agenda, an ‘open method of coordination’ (OMC) with a view to providing the Member States with broad guidelines on restructuring;\n",
        "22. Calls for reforms to state aids seeking to target them as much as possible towards the areas which contribute most to growth and employment, thus preventing their being used to fund unjustified relocations or restructuring; demands also that for weakened sectors requiring specific or transitional rules, state aid should be authorised more easily where it does not distort competition in the common market;\n",
        "23. Proposes creating a legal regulatory framework under which Community aid would be made subordinate to compliance with conditions which concern the protection of the interests of the communities and regions and the creation of more and better jobs;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Member States to set up specific measures adapted to the tradition of each Member State, which may take the form of permanent conversion units, where necessary, to assist employees affected by restructuring and guarantee equal treatment whatever the employee’s nationality, sex and age; calls on the Member States to treat as an urgent priority the adoption of measures for the mutual recognition of professional training certificates and the certification of informal qualifications and the recognition of experience; considers it essential finally that action plans be adopted to support workers who are made redundant; considers also that aid for training and re-training should be given as quickly as possible;\n",
        "25. Considers that equity participation by employees maybe an appropriate way to secure greater involvement in decision-taking concerning restructuring; calls, therefore, on the social partners – and on the Commission and Member States – to move forward in this debate and to re-enter this subject on the agenda of the broad debate on the future of social Europe launched by the British presidency in 2005;\n",
        "26. Calls on the European Union, in deepening the internal market and concluding international trade agreements, to take into account the difficulties facing enterprises so that the consequences of its policies are predictable;\n",
        "27.  Considers, with a view to anticipating and accompanying as effectively as possible the difficulties firms may face, that use should be made of all relevant sectorial analysis tools so as to permit the monitoring and ongoing evaluation of each sector of economic activity in Europe; welcomes, therefore, the willingness expressed in the above-mentioned communication of 31 March 2005 to give an enhanced role to the EMCC and stresses the need for EU citizens to have greater access to the EMCC’s work;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to propose a European one-stop shop for all citizens, local authorities, social partners and businesses affected, enabling them to find information on the problems related to restructuring, on the opportunities which exist for anticipating and properly managing restructuring, and on their rights (including access to various types of subsidy) and obligations;\n",
        "29. Stresses the need for analyses of the monitoring of past restructuring events, with a view to ascertaining their real impact on the businesses concerned, so as to permit a more effective approach to future restructuring;\n",
        "30. Calls on the European Union’s commercial partners to implement laws on intellectual property protection and on the Member States to do their utmost to combat counterfeiting effectively;\n",
        "31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
