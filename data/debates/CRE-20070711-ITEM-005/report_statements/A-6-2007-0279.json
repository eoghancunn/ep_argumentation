    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the efforts deployed by the German Presidency of the Council to achieve a unanimous agreement at the Summit of 21-22 June 2007;\n",
        "2.  Takes note of the mandate for the IGC which was agreed by the European Council; welcomes its elaborate precision and the tight timetable for the conclusion of the IGC, and calls on the Member States not to retreat from the commitments to which they subscribed in the European Council; expresses a favourable opinion on the convening of the IGC;\n",
        "3.  Regrets, however, that this mandate implies the loss of some important elements that had been agreed during the 2004 IGC, such as the definition of the EU as a Union of the citizens and the States of Europe; as well as a long delay in the introduction of others;\n",
        "4.  Expresses its concern about the fact that the mandate allows for an increasing number of derogations granted to certain Member States from the implementation of major provisions of the envisaged Treaties that could lead to a weakening of the cohesion of the Union;\n",
        "5.  Regrets that the mandate allows for various drafting changes compared to the Constitutional Treaty which give an impression of distrust vis-à-vis the Union and its institutions and thus send a wrong signal to public opinion;\n",
        "6.  Regrets the decreasing European goodwill and political courage of Member States' representatives and expresses its concern about the evolution of attitudes opposed to the European ideas of solidarity and integration;\n",
        "7.  Stresses that the mandate allows for the modification of the denomination of legal acts, but does not provide for any substantial change in their structure and hierarchy, and expresses its intention to closely scrutinise the way in which this will be introduced in the related provisions, with a view to guaranteeing political accountability and safeguarding its legislative powers, in particular as regards the control of delegated acts;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes, nevertheless, the fact that the mandate safeguards much of the substance of the Constitutional Treaty, notably the single legal personality of the Union and the suppression of the pillars structure, the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council and co-decision by Parliament and the Council, the elements of participatory democracy, the legally binding status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the enhancement of the coherence of the external action of the Union and the balanced institutional package;\n",
        "9.  Observes that all positive results in terms of the strengthening of democratic procedures and citizens rights, in terms of enlargement of competences and in terms of definition of the EU's values and objectives derive exclusively from the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe;\n",
        "10. Welcomes the fact that economic and monetary union was introduced in the Treaty on European Union as an objective of the EU;\n",
        "11. Welcomes the fact that the mandate provides for the introduction of certain new elements in the treaties, such as the explicit mention of climate change and solidarity in the field of energy;\n",
        "12. Recalls that the EU has declared itself, both to its own citizens and to the whole world, to be a community of values, that fundamental rights and freedoms form the innermost core of this community of values, and that they have been comprehensively expressed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and recognised by the EU institutions and all the Member States on many occasions; considers, therefore, that if one or more Member States now claim an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this would represent a dramatic setback and cause serious damage to the EU's innermost sense of identity; for this reason, urgently appeals to all the Member States once again to make every effort to overcome this internal division and reach a consensus after all on the unrestricted validity of this Charter;\n",
        "13. Invites the IGC to conclude its work before the end of the year 2007, so as to allow the new Treaty to enter into force in good time before the 2009 European elections;\n",
        "14. Welcomes the strengthening of the modalities of its participation in the IGC at all levels as agreed by the European Council;\n",
        "15. Reserves its right to address to the IGC concrete proposals on specific items within the scope of the mandate;\n",
        "16. Will respond to the invitation made by the European Council to deal with the issue of its own composition in due time;\n",
        "17. Stresses its intention to carefully scrutinise the outcome of the IGC in order to assess whether the reforms agreed during the negotiations comply in a satisfactory way with its interpretation of the mandate;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Member States and its representatives to ensure full transparency of the work done by the IGC, notably by publishing all the documents submitted to it for discussion;\n",
        "19. Reaffirms its intention to maintain a very intensive relationship with the national parliaments and with civil society during the process of revision of the treaties;\n",
        "20. Calls on the IGC to ensure, for reasons of transparency, that the results of its work will also be published in the form of a draft consolidated version of the Treaties;\n",
        "21.Announces its firm resolve to put forward, after the 2009 elections, new proposals on a further constitutional settlement for the Union, in accordance with the clause on treaty revision[3];\n",
        "22. Calls on the IGC and the Commission to put forward specific proposals to involve European citizens once again in the continuation of the constitutional process;\n",
        "23. Invites its competent committee to study the introduction of a modification of its Rules of Procedure so as to lend official character to the European Union flag and hymn contained in the European Constitution in its activities and premises;\n",
        "24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution constituting its opinion on the convening of the IGC to the Council, to the Commission, to the Heads of State or Government and the parliaments of the Member States and to the European Central Bank.\n"
