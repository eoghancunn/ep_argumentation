{"speaker": "Richard Corbett,", "english": "Richard Corbett, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes the convening of the IGC, accepts the mandate and supports the timetable.\nMany people have commented that this mandate salvages some 90% of the content of the Constitutional Treaty, and this has given rise to much comment. But colleagues will also know that recent scientific research demonstrates that human beings and mice are genetically 90% identical. However, the 10% difference is rather important. And so here with this mandate, the 10% difference is rather important.\nThe loss of the constitutional designation of the Treaty, the failure to change the name of the high representative to foreign minister, the failure to mention in the Treaty the supremacy of Community law, the loss of the symbols and the numerous derogations and opt outs for particular Member States mean that for those Member States the percentage – be it 90 or whatever – is even lower. All these make it a very different treaty that is envisaged than the Constitutional Treaty.\nThat will be a matter of regret for this House and for a large majority of the Member States. Nonetheless, those changes will make it possible, will make it easier to ratify the Treaty in all 27 Member States, and that is the crucial point that we have to recognise.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard Corbett, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes the convening of the IGC, accepts the mandate and supports the timetable.\nMany people have commented that this mandate salvages some 90% of the content of the Constitutional Treaty, and this has given rise to much comment.
