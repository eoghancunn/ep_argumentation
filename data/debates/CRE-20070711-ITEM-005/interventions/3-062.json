{"speaker": "Andrew Duff,", "english": "Andrew Duff, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, my group welcomes the prospect of a quick and efficient IGC that clears up the ambiguity following the period of reflection, secures legal certainty and builds a strong consensus behind the reform treaty. Of course, it is especially appropriate for Parliament to seek, inside the IGC, to protect what it stood to profit from in the 2004 treaty. But we should also be certain that the growing number and crowd of opt-outs and minimalistic footnotes do not contaminate the integrity of the corpus of European law and the jurisdiction of the courts. We will fight to prevent a political spillover from the UK protocol on the Charter; a multi-tier Council is one thing, but Parliament cannot tolerate first- and second-class citizenship.\nWe should fight the popular suspicion that the IGC is nothing more than a grand exercise in the obscurantism designed to extricate certain states from pledges to have referenda, and I was very pleased that Prime Minister Sócrates is determined that plebiscites should not be pitched to oppose parliaments. Maximum transparency is desirable and Parliament’s greater role, superior strength and more pluralistic presence inside the IGC will assist to secure such transparency.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Andrew Duff, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, my group welcomes the prospect of a quick and efficient IGC that clears up the ambiguity following the period of reflection, secures legal certainty and builds a strong consensus behind the reform treaty.
