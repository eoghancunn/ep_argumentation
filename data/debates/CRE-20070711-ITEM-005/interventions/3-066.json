{"speaker": "Bernard Wojciechowski,", "english": "Bernard Wojciechowski, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, the new Treaty is a decoy for the implementation of the former constitutional Treaty. The report stresses that the mandate safeguards the substance of the constitutional Treaty. Two nations said ‘no’. It is therefore little more than a sloppy attempt at federalising the Union at any price. It also suggests that Parliament reaffirm its intention to maintain an open dialogue.\nThis Parliament has become so arrogant that if it were not so pathetic it would be funny. To say that we maintain an open dialogue with anyone is a mere joke. Support for the constitutional Treaty has not increased. Scholars and politicians declare it a complete failure. Any new Treaty ought to consider the following aspects.\nFirstly, the final product will have to be ratified in all Member States pursuant to the constitutional provisions, and referendums should be repeated. The attempt to solve the issues of integration over the heads of civil society is unacceptable.\nSecondly, the constitutional Treaty embodied a compromise between the Member States and the political systems. The revised Treaty will not go further than the arrangements contained in that Treaty. It will become a dwarfed constitutional Treaty.\nThirdly, the attempt to make another treaty causes a significant delay at this stage of the political reform of the EU. Reform is possible, yet for some reason, it is not pursued. The changes within the first pillar are feasible in the areas provided for by the TEC. The implemented reforms within this procedure may include the intergovernmental area, basically the second and third pillars.\nThere is a possibility to regulate many issues based on international agreements concluded by the Member States. As far as the third pillar is concerned, the strengthening of the structures of judicial and police cooperation can also be achieved. It is possible to secure the EU’s democratic legitimisation through the holding of public Council meetings, the strengthening of the national parliaments, consultative position and giving this Parliament the power to designate the President of the Commission.\nThe rush for a new Treaty makes no sense at all. A new document may not be implemented through some back channel. This is against the will of the people. Demands for a legal personality, the single currency or the rotating system in the Commission are extreme, although over the last two years no European nation has expressed such a will.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bernard Wojciechowski, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, the new Treaty is a decoy for the implementation of the former constitutional Treaty.
