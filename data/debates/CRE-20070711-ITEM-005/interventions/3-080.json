{"speaker": "Manuel Lobo Antunes,", "english": "Manuel Lobo Antunes, President-in-Office of the Council . (PT) We have already been debating this issue of the Treaty for a considerable length of time this morning – since 9 a.m., as one speaker has pointed out – and I therefore think that the most important observations and comments have been made, many of which have certainly been interesting, and from which the Portuguese Presidency will naturally draw its own conclusions.\nI was a member of the European Convention, along with several of the MEPs present in this Chamber, and also took part in the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. I am not saying that between 2004 and now I have not had cause to be apprehensive, and even to lack belief, but I have always known that Europe’s driving force is compromise and the willingness to move forward. Today I can tell you clearly that this willingness to move forward, this willingness to compromise, to reach agreement, has, in my view, returned.\nWe could not afford to fail and did not fail at the European Council, so let us give an unequivocal signal to Europe, its citizens and the world that this is a project for the future, a project that serves Europeans, a project that serves the world. Naturally, we may not all be satisfied with the mandate adopted by the European Council, but let no one be in any doubt that this mandate will give us a Treaty with more efficient institutions, more democratic decision-making and more appropriate responses both to the Union’s internal problems, and to the external problems the Union has to address.\nThis is and will be the mandate we needed. We shall certainly have the Treaty the citizens of Europe have long desired. As the Prime Minister of Portugal has said here, ‘we have the mandate, we do not have the Treaty', and the mandate we received is not to change that document but to create the new Treaty. That is our objective and we shall do so with all our strength and all our conviction.\nOur target for finishing that task is October and I hope in October to be able to announce here the good news of a new Treaty for our Union. We shall therefore not permit any lack of discipline, as one of the MEPs suggested. I would also like to assure you that all Portuguese Presidencies are characterised by transparency, communication with citizens and communication with institutions. We shall of course continue in that vein and I can assure you that this is one of the Portuguese Presidency’s commitments.\nAs I say, I hope to have some good news for you in October.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Manuel Lobo Antunes, President-in-Office of the Council .
