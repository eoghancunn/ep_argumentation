    "paragraphs": [
        "1.Welcomes the Council's Seventh and Eighth Annual Reports and reiterates the importance of annual reviews, as prescribed by Operative Provision 8 of the Code, as the main mechanism for reviewing and strengthening the Code;\n",
        "2.Welcomes the emphasis placed upon transparency by recent Presidencies (the UK, Austria and Finland), which has resulted in further cooperation between Member States in their consultation on denials and reporting on data collection, in their presentation of data in the Annual Reports, in their outreach activities with third parties and in deepening their dialogue with the European Parliament;\n",
        "3.   Finds it unacceptable that no steps have been taken to adopt the Code as a Common Position despite the fact that a text was agreed by the COARM Working Group in June 2005;\n",
        "4.   Welcomes the fact that on 26 September 2005 best practices for interpretation of criterion 8 (sustainable development) were agreed unopposed by the COARM Working Party and have been included in the revised User’s Guide; nevertheless remains concerned that there has been no attempt to go beyond a collation of existing norms; calls for criterion 8 to be revised as soon as possible with a view to developing improved practice, for example by exploring the links between armed violence and development; supports the continuation of this process, with best practices being developed for the remaining criteria in consultation with the European Parliament and other interested parties;\n",
        "5.   Welcomes the recent clarification in the User's Guide that agreements on licensed production overseas should be treated as an export licence; however, remains deeply concerned by past cases in the EU relating to transfers of production capacities overseas, including licensed production deals, and calls for further strengthening of provisions to regulate licensed production overseas in particular and the transfer of production capacity more generally;\n",
        "6.   Urges the Member States to take the following steps to further control the licensing of arms production overseas: (a) to issue an export denial for any permits for licensed arms production if there is a risk that arms from the production abroad would be used in violation of a state's existing obligations under international law, (b) to issue an export denial for any permit for licensed production overseas that is not accompanied by a legally binding agreement, in each case, on the production limits and the permitted export destinations and end usefor the product; (c) to review licensing contracts at regular intervals, so that risks of diversion can be reassessed and the licensing agreement changed accordingly;\n",
        "7.   Reaffirms the need to develop further the denial notification system; calls again for greater exchange of information on bilateral consultation on denials and for information on such consultations to be exchanged and reported at the EU level;\n",
        "8.   Calls on the Member States to pay greater attention to the background of the country receiving arms, in order to prevent them being used by terrorist groups or being put to improper use;\n",
        "9.   Reiterates its call for Member States to agree on a list of countries involved in armed conflicts to which arms exports should be banned in principle, based upon a mechanism whereby a presumption of denial to such states is monitored by the UN Security Council monitoring mechanisms on arms embargoes and the EU's relevant Working Groups; with this in mind, calls on Member States to bring their policies on arms exports to the Middle East region into line with the Code of Conduct;\n",
        "10. Recommends that national export credit agencies, in performing their task of promoting government-backed private corporate investment in economically unstable regions, and especially developing countries, follow a policy not to re-insure contracts by means of loans or other types of guarantees in the event of non-payment by the recipients for military-related exports to third countries; insists that any such loans issued in the past should neither be allowed to increase the debt situation of the beneficiary country nor be regarded as official development aid;\n",
        "11. Welcomes the additional transparency in the Eighth Report resulting from the inclusion of a separate section in Table A on exports to countries under embargo; calls for the Political and Security Committee to have a regular dialogue on the application of the Code and the User's Guide (in particular the application of the best practices) with regard to arms exports to countries on the Watch List (or subject to detailed analysis by the EU Joint Situation Centre); calls for the European Parliament to be involved in these discussions;\n",
        "12. Considers that a clear, efficient and harmonised common arms export control policy, anchored in a legally binding Code of Conduct, can play a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, conflict prevention, regional stability and the promotion of human rights;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Presidency-in-office and the Governments of the Member States to explain why the Code has not been adopted as a Common Position despite the fact that the text was agreed by the COARM Working Party in June 2005;\n",
        "14. Welcoming the continued development of best practices under the User's Guide, nevertheless regrets that the failure to transform the Code into a Common Position is weakening the further development of EU export controls, especially in the important areas of intangible transfers, transit controls and moves towards further general harmonisation of EU export controls;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the inclusion in the Annual Reports of a specific chapter on dialogue with the European Parliament;\n",
        "16. Welcomes the initiatives of the UK, Austrian and Finnish Presidencies to present their work on the development of the Code to the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Security and Defence as well as their emphasis on transparency and dialogue;\n",
        "17. Welcomes the opportunity provided by the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies for the European Parliament's Rapporteur to engage in discussion and exchange of information at a COARM Working Group meeting on the drawing-up of the European Parliament's Report and the Council's Annual Report;\n",
        "18. Welcomes, as measures of increased transparency and confidence-building, the decision referred to in the Eighth Annual Report that each Presidency should endeavour to meet the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Security and Defence as well as the practice of inviting the Parliament's Rapporteur to a COARM meeting once per Presidency;\n",
        "19. Calls for the further association of the European Parliament with the process of developing outreach activities and in particular taking forward the priority guidelines to promote an International Arms Trade Treaty and developing further cooperation and consultation with interested third parties including international NGOs and the defence industry;\n",
        "20. Urges the Council to require every Member State to publish national reports meeting agreed minimum standards and to require that such reports be sent to the European Parliament and to national parliaments;\n",
        "21. Calls for an annual debate between the European Parliament and national parliaments on their assessment of the progress made by the Member States towards achieving transparency in their handling of arms exports and in the implementation of the 1998 Code of Conduct;\n",
        "22. Welcomes the objective, contained in the Sixth Annual Report, of developing a “toolbox” and specific mechanisms to regulate arms exports to post–embargoed states;\n",
        "23. Recalls the Conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Libya of 11 October 2004, which stated: “The Council recalled that arms transfers to Libya will be subject to the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and decided that a special post-embargo arms transfers regime (‘toolbox’), which is presently being developed within the Council, will apply”; calls on the Presidency to set out the status of this toolbox;\n",
        "24. Is aware of a lack of development of the “toolbox” along with a specific mechanism on monitoring; therefore recalls its previous position that thorough monitoring is necessary even after an embargo has been lifted and that there is need for a review mechanism to be set up to assess and revise the toolbox if necessary and to monitor regularly the situation in states where the embargo has been lifted, bearing in mind the reasons for the lifting of the embargo; urges COARM to review the mechanism on a regular basis and to report on such discussions to the European Parliament;\n",
        "25. Regards it as important that Member States should have the opportunity to consult each other on the licences issued for exports to post-embargoed states; calls for data to be collected and published in subsequent Annual Reports on the substance and outcomes of such consultations;\n",
        "26. Stresses the importance of improving the exchange of timely information with the European Parliament, in particular as regards licence denial and the toolbox’s modus operandi;\n",
        "27. Urges the Member States to apply equal criteria to the evaluation of third states when considering any restriction or embargo on arms exports on account of human rights violations or growing regional instability;\n",
        "28. Considers that the embargo imposed on China should not be lifted until there is a clear and lasting improvement in the situation regarding human rights and social and political freedoms; points out that arms exports will undermine peace and stability in eastern Asia and increase the danger of regional instability, particularly following the crisis arising from the nuclear testing by North Korea;\n",
        "29. Expresses deep concern at the blatant violation of the arms embargo by all parties to the Darfur conflict as reported by the experts sent in by the UN Security Council and the resulting escalation of hostilities there in recent months;\n",
        "30. Welcomes the ongoing development of the User's Guide as a useful and practical tool for harmonisation of interpretation of the Code's criteria;\n",
        "31. Notes the changes to the User's Guide, in particular the guidelines for criteria 2, 7 and 8; encourages further updates in line with new developments in the Code – for example, with regard to further guidelines for criteria 3 and 4; calls for respect for human rights to be used as a general criterion;\n",
        "32. Recognises that incremental steps are being taken to improve the collection and sharing of data between Member States, to be annexed to the Annual Reports, including important improvements in data presentation under the Eighth Annual Report; nevertheless calls for the quality of national reporting to be substantially enhanced in order to increase transparency and to permit accurate assessment of Member States' application of the Code of Conduct;\n",
        "33.Calls on Member States to streamline their national arms export licensing procedures, clarify the relevant domestic institutional procedures and responsibilities and eliminate any ambiguities in their systems concerning the export licensing procedures for “military” and “non-military” arms, which can be used by arms exporters to export small arms and light weapons as “non-military arms” to conflict-prone regions;\n",
        "34. Urges the Council to require every Member State to publish national reports meeting agreed minimum standards;\n",
        "35. Urges the adoption of agreed common reporting standards to which all states must be required to adhere, including standards relating to the number of export and brokering licences covered by a recipient country as well as information on licence denials, a full description of the types of equipment licensed for export, the quantity of each type of equipment licensed for export and specification of the type of end-user; urges that the funding of arms exports, e.g. in the form of state loans and loan guarantees, should in future be included in the national reports;\n",
        "36. Insists that strict and transparent national export controls must be maintained until all EU Member States have harmonised their national export control policies to the extent that would allow them to transform the EU Code of Conduct into a legal instrument capable of regulating the authorisation, management (including final destination) and verification of intra-Community and international arms exports;\n",
        "37. Recognising the willingness of the Council to selectively take on board past recommendations from the European Parliament on improving the EU Consolidated Report, urges the Council to take the following important steps:\n",
        "38. Calls for the removal of the new guidelines on “incorporation” and calls upon all Member States to reaffirm their commitment to apply the Code to the export of components for incorporation;\n",
        "39. Welcomes the Priority Guideline on post-export controls and urges Member States to agree procedures for the monitoring and verification of deliveries to, and end-use/user in, recipient countries; recommends that Member States develop information-exchange mechanisms and establish a database to include information on end-use concerns in recipient countries, past instances of misuse and/or diversion, information exchange between Member States on delivery and end-use/user verification of exports;\n",
        "40. Calls for more pro-active European Union and national approaches to the control of exports and re-exports of dual-use items in order to avoid the risk of possible access to sensitive items by undesirable end-users in third countries, including non-state actors;\n",
        "41. Urges the Member States to keep the human rights situation in arms importing countries under constant review;\n",
        "42. Welcomes the positive response to the European Parliament's call for more information to be published on the database containing information on outreach activities referred to in the Sixth and Seventh Annual Reports;\n",
        "43. Recommends that Member States actively pursue key outreach priorities and continue to use the mechanism for coordinating and collecting information on such activities;\n",
        "44. Welcomes the positive response to the European Parliament's request to the Council that it should share with the European Parliament details concerning “Troika” meetings relevant to export controls and concerning ad hoc workshops and seminars with countries such as China and countries in the western Balkans on conventional arms export controls; recommends that parliamentarians be invited to attend those seminars as observers;\n",
        "45. Calls on the Council to raise awareness of the principles of the Code of Conduct, and to emphasise the need for an international treaty establishing common principles for world trade in arms, in all “Troika” meetings and relations with third countries and with regional and international organisations;\n",
        "46. Calls on Member States which do not yet comply with the Common Position on Arms Brokering to set out a timetable for their compliance;\n",
        "47. Continues to urge Member States to improve their record on the implementation of the Common Position on Arms Brokering, particularly through the development of national legislation and the implementation of planned information exchange mechanisms concerning brokering activities;\n",
        "48. Urges common minimum practice on extra-territorial controls, including the prohibition of brokering activities which violate an arms embargo, whether carried out at home or abroad; Member States should also follow the example of countries, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, which require a licence for brokering of military equipment carried out abroad; as a minimum, Member States should follow the example of Germany where brokering in small arms and light weapons carried out abroad will also be subject to licensing;\n",
        "49. Recommends that Member States further develop the Common Position on Arms Brokering by setting up national registries of all known arms brokers, to include information on transportation and financial services related to third-country transfers of military equipment, on the basis that such information must be equally shared between all Member States; urges that the brokering database for denials be extended to include information on the consultation on denials;\n",
        "50. Recommends that all measures be taken to avoid brokers' initiatives to irresponsibly obtain and export weapons to third parties, which have hitherto been collected in the course of ESDP peacekeeping missions and other external peacekeeping operations involving the EU and its Member States (as has been the case in Bosnia-Herzegovina);\n",
        "51. Notes that the United States has extended its legislation on the control of military exports to cover private security companies, and therefore calls for the EU to consider similar steps to extend the 1998 EU Code of Conduct so that it covers private security services; as a first step the EU could add to the Common Military List the following activities and services requiring a licence for export: armed personnel and site protection, armed transport security, military weapons and equipment training, strategic and tactical training, security sector reform, military and security consultancy, military logistics, counter-intelligence services and operational support;\n",
        "52. Welcomes the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 of 27 June 2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment[11];\n",
        "53. Calls for the scope of that Regulation to be extended to cover intra-Community transfers, in order to prevent any possible contraventions;\n",
        "54. Welcomes the fact that the Seventh and Eighth Annual Reports have taken up Parliament's recommendation that consideration be given to the best way of involving and assisting acceding countries and new neighbours with a view to ensuring the harmonisation of policies on arms export controls and full implementation of the principles and criteria contained in the Code of Conduct;\n",
        "55. Calls on the Council to publish a report on the transfer control system and practice in any state under consideration for accession status before that state is permitted to accede, and to make the advancement towards accession status of any state not meeting EU transfer control standards conditional on its coming up to those standards; wishes the transfer control system and practice to be carefully monitored in any state involved in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process, even if it does not yet have the status of candidate for EU membership;\n",
        "56. Underlines the need for the EU and its Member States to play a dynamic role in supporting national, regional and international processes;\n",
        "57. Calls on the Council and the Commission to set out concrete measures for implementation of the five priority areas for the UN Programme of Action (UNPoA), namely, brokering, marking and tracing, ammunition, development and technical assistance, and for the development of a follow-up mechanism for the UNPoA;\n",
        "58.Calls on the EU Presidency and Member States to match their declaratory diplomacy in favour of an International Arms Trade Treaty with assertive and determined action to implement the resolution adopted on 26 October 2006 by the UN General Assembly's First Committee with a view to establishing an effective, legally binding International Arms Trade Treaty laying down minimum global standards for arms transfers;\n",
        "59. Calls on the Council and the Commission to include in their further negotiations concerning developments in relation to the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements the question of adherence to all EU embargoes on trade in arms;\n",
        "60. Calls on the Member States to commit themselves once more to the principle that the criteria of the EU Code of Conduct will not be compromised in the pursuit of broader foreign policy objectives; o o        o\n",
        "61. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the UN Secretary-General.\n"
