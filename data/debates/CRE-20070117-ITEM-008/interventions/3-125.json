{"speaker": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck,", "english": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair again. My congratulations to you.\n(NL) First of all and most of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda on his very well laid-out report which enjoys my group’s unanimous approval and which we intend to approve here in tomorrow’s plenary. The report lists all the progress that has been made recently thanks to the unstinting efforts on the part of this House. For example, the three most recent presidencies have submitted their activities in connection with the code of conduct to our security and defence subcommittee and have also discussed these with them, and I would invite the German Presidency to do the same.\nWe have also, for instance, noticed the fine-tuning and clarifications of the criteria in connection with the human rights situation in the country of destination and in connection with the risks involved in preventing arms exports or reexporting exported weapons. My group, among others, takes the view that further refinement is needed in connection with the country of destination’s internal situation in connection with the repercussions on the regional situation, and in connection with the compatibility of arms exports with the country of destination’s technical and economic capacity.\nOur biggest disappointment in this connection is the failure of the Member States to translate the code of conduct into a common position of the Council, a common position which would make this code far more forceful than it currently is. This would also be far better proof of the Member States being serious about contributing to worldwide arms control and disarmament. I took great interest in the Commission statements in this respect and was also delighted to hear that the Commission will be presiding over the Kimberley process. I take particular pleasure in this, Commissioner, as this was something I used to help do in a previous life.\nFinally, I should like to make it absolutely clear that my group is opposed to lifting the arms embargo against China and that we urge the Member States to put much more effort into establishing an international treaty on arms trade under the aegis of the United Nations. The international context may not be very conducive to multilateral agreements, as the Commissioner was very right to point out, but that is no reason for the Member States and the EU Member States to slacken their efforts in this area.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair again.
