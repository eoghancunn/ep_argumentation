{"speaker": "Günter Gloser,", "english": "Günter Gloser, President-in-Office of the Council . (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful to your House for presenting this report, and in particular to your rapporteur Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has been, as rapporteur, responsible for this annual report on the EU’s code of conduct for four years now, and of whose work the Council and the Member States are appreciative.\nI also want to stress that the Council welcomes many of the suggestions in the report and will endeavour to implement them. Among the many I could mention are the further development of best practice in the application of the code’s criteria; improvement of the reports produced by the nation states and those consolidated at EU level; the complete implementation of the Common Position on the control of arms brokering; the ongoing invitation of Members of the European Parliament to certain seminars and workshops; the continuation of the EU Presidency’s practice of presenting papers from the Council working party on arms exports to the security and defence sub-committee and the invitation extended to the rapporteur to attend meetings with the working party.\nThe European Union and the Member States will also give their full support to negotiations towards an international treaty on the arms trade, as was stated by the Council in its conclusions of 11 December 2006, in which it also stated, inter alia , that it welcomed the formal commencement of the process of drafting a legally binding international treaty on the arms trade as accomplished by the adoption, by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 6 December 2006, of the resolution on an international treaty on the arms trade, for the purpose of laying down common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons.\nThe Council was particularly pleased to note that, in the operative sections of the resolution, the Secretary-General was requested to seek the member states’ views as to the feasibility, potential scope of, and provisional criteria for, such a comprehensive and binding legal instrument. It expressed the same sentiment concerning the appointment of a group of government experts who would begin examining these issues in 2008.\nThe Council therefore, in its conclusions, re-emphasised the fact that the European Union and its individual Member States would be playing an active part in this process. The European Union and all other member states of the United Nations are called on to actively support the process of drafting a treaty on the arms trade, to communicate their views to the Secretary-General and to participate in the work of the group of government experts.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Günter Gloser, President-in-Office of the Council .
