Experienced and educated people transfer their knowledge, skills or perhaps the achievements of their occupational group to others.

It teaches life skills and promotes their involvement in civic life. Travel to other countries as part of volunteering, in turn, promotes inter-cultural dialogue and teaches tolerance and respect. This is why local and national authorities and international organisations should do more to support and promote volunteering.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Czesław Adam Siekierski (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to two specific forms of voluntary activity.\nThe first is the transfer of know-how in a highly specialised area.
