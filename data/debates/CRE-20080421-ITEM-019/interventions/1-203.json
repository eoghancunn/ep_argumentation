Yet this activity is underestimated, in my opinion and too unfamiliar to the public.\nThe consequences are negative for volunteer work since there are insufficient actions of support from the state, even if it can represent a considerable part of a country’s economy.\nAs a Member of the European Parliament, coming from a former communist country, I can tell you about the very low volunteer participation in my country.\nSince the communist regime introduced mandatory unpaid work in order to serve the state, this practice is now associated with that period in the people’s subconscious.\nToday, the percentage of volunteers in Romania is much lower than in most Member States. The activity is often unknown to the citizens, the state policy does not encourage it and people’s mentality is also not in favour of this activity.\nCitizens should be informed about the positive effects of volunteering.
