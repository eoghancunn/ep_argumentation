The report promotes the idea of contribution, which is dealt with comprehensively and objectively on both a theoretical and practical level. Our fellow Member’s work is important; I welcome it and congratulate her warmly.\nWe in turn have also tried to contribute to her activity. We have among other things brought out the importance of corporate volunteering, the coordination of voluntary initiatives reconciling family with professional life, as well as the creation of rapid action volunteer sections in every region to deal speedily with natural disasters and accidents.\nIn general terms, volunteering helps among other things to increase GDP. As has been said, volunteering boosts skill acquisition and improves employability of a volunteer. It provides socially and educationally excluded persons and the unemployed with genuine opportunities and encourages immigrants to participate in the local community.\nThe actions and the activity of volunteers speak for themselves. In my country, Greece, for example, the 2004 Olympic volunteers won us our most significant medal. Both individual and group volunteering are vital in social, economic, environmental and cultural terms. They unify all differences and peculiarities, while promoting them and revealing them in a spirit of concord and common aims.\nI congratulate the rapporteur once more. I call on you to support Mrs Harkin’s report and to join us in signing the joint written declaration that we have drawn up with other Members, asking that 2011 should be declared the European Year of Volunteering.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Emmanouil Angelakas (PPE-DE). - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our fellow Member Mrs Harkin on volunteering is a way for the European Parliament to demonstrate its social aspect to European citizens.
