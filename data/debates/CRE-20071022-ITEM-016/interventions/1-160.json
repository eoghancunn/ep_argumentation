{"speaker": "Stavros Dimas,", "english": "Stavros Dimas, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for the quality of this evening’s debate. I would like to comment, time permitting, on three of the issues you have addressed.\nRegarding the ambitious level of the strategy, the Commission has proposed its strategy on the basis of a thorough impact assessment. We have analysed the various options of a level to reduce CO 2 emissions from cars, taking into account measurability, monitorability and accountability.\nOn this basis we have proposed to deliver the 120 g of CO 2 per kilometre objective through an integrated approach. One hundred and thirty grams will be delivered through passenger car technology and ten additional grams will be provided through complementary measures, including fuel efficiency targets for light commercial vehicles and an increased use of biofuels.\nThis approach towards achieving the 120 g target is, in our view, the most cost-effective combination of options, and we will thus propose legislation accordingly.\nSecondly, the legislative framework implementing the integrated approach will be the central pillar of our revised strategy, but it is not the only one. As underlined in your report, finding ways to encourage consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars will enable us significantly to reduce their environmental impact, along with the fuel bill of drivers in the European Union.\nIn the context of the review in the Car Labelling Directive, we will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament in the field of consumer information.\nThirdly, the Commission agrees that a longer-term strategy should be considered, in order to provide predictability to car makers. We will thus consider the potential for progress beyond 2012, and the 120 g objective, on the basis of an impact assessment. In this context, the Commission will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament concerning future emission targets.\nI believe I have addressed some of the main concerns that have been voiced, and I hope that Plenary will adopt a resolution which strongly supports the approach proposed by the Commission.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stavros Dimas, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for the quality of this evening’s debate.
