{"speaker": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). –", "english": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, across the European Union, housing affordability is creeping up the political agenda. More and more people are being priced out of the housing market and face exclusion, with first-time buyers being particularly marginalised.\nThat is why paragraph 6, hoping that national and local decision-makers will adopt measures to help young people get their first home, is such an important point. So, too, is the mention of rural housing. In Scotland, many people born and brought up in idyllic small towns and villages are priced out of their communities due to lack of affordable social housing. Housing today needs to meet the needs of tomorrow. It will not only have to be accessible, but also to be environmentally friendly.\nI thank the rapporteur and hope that we can see more discussion at a European level over how we can learn from one another how to make housing decent, affordable and accessible to all.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, across the European Union, housing affordability is creeping up the political agenda.
