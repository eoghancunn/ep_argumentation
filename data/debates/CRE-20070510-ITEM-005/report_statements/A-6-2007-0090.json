    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Considers that the right to adequate housing at reasonable prices is an important fundamental right that is recognised in a number of international charters and constitutions of the Member States;\n",
        "2.   Considers that the renovation of housing for social and energy efficiency purposes is not merely an urban issue and that the large-scale, housing-related challenges that rural areas currently face, especially in the new cohesion countries, must be appropriately addressed; 3    Calls for the identification, at European level, of a series of quality indicators defining the concept of ‘adequate housing’;\n",
        "4.  Stresses the importance for the EU of adopting a European housing charter based on the work of Parliament's Urban Housing Intergroup and on the charter approved by the political groups represented;\n",
        "5.   Insists on the need – in the context of the Lisbon Strategy – to strengthen the right to housing benefits and to other social rights, so that worker mobility can become a reality;\n",
        "6.  Hopes that national and local decision-makers will adopt measures to help young people get their first home;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Commission to include housing in the debate on cities and the sustainable development of the regions, and in the work programme of the inter-services task force set up to coordinate policies affecting the urban dimension;\n",
        "8.  Stresses the importance of safety issues ·relating to crime, especially in underprivileged areas ·relating to buildings (construction and operating standards) ●  relating to electricity and gas infrastructure, water, sewerage and heating (the safety of existing systems and of upgrading technologies and the replacement of outdated pipes);\n",
        "9.  Believes also in the importance of a consistent approach in tackling the different dimensions of sustainable development (solidarity, environment and energy), accessibility, health, security and quality of use and of ensuring that the burden of housing improvements matches the resources of households;\n",
        "10. Stresses the importance of cultural centres, intercultural dialogue and joint projects involving several areas in promoting the integration of the various communities living in cities, suburbs and nearby rural areas;\n",
        "11. Stresses the need to take into account the specific housing problems of rural environments in order to favour a balanced policy on spatial planning that counters segregation and the depopulation of rural areas, especially considering the many handicaps in such areas, such as low levels of earnings, scattered and dilapidated housing and a lack of rental, social or other accommodation;\n",
        "13. Believes that, in the rural environment, it is essential to propose incentives for the acquisition, rehabilitation and renovation of old buildings, to support public and private bodies providing advice and personalised guidance to private individuals and business people wanting to settle and to improve the supply of public and private, new and renovated social housing;\n",
        "14. Encourages the Commission to undertake a study into, and the Member States to improve data gathering in respect of the cost of and the demand for housing and the property market in general, taking into account the heterogeneity of housing occupation, the changes in traditional family structures and the specific circumstances of young people and the ageing and declining population; furthermore, calls upon the Member States to take into account access to and  the rate of utilisation of technical, social, cultural and transport infrastructure when planning and restructuring housing projects and gathering data;\n",
        "15. Emphasises that, with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, housing-related problems, as a national issue, should be dealt with predominantly at local level and from this perspective municipalities should be supported;\n",
        "16. Takes the view that, given the complexity of the issues affecting housing, an integrated approach, rooted in the principles of subsidiarity and proximity, should be adopted, so as to ensure the simultaneous introduction of various factors which would promote access to housing, improve building quality, improve quality of life for all generations and promote the attractiveness of both urban and rural environments;\n",
        "17. Draws attention to the fact that most public housing is not located in healthy environments, nor does the quality of the housing ensure healthy living conditions, for which reasons development measures financed by the European Regional Development Fund should be used not only to promote housing but also to improve the environmental and health situation of public housing tenants, thus helping to improve their quality of life;\n",
        "18. Considers, furthermore, that taking an integrated approach will have a greater chance of success if it is taken by the local and regional authorities, which can provide an overall view, optimal coordination of the policies and measures implemented in the urban area and a long-term vision of the development of the urban area in question; accordingly, encourages the Member States, in accordance with Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, to involve cities in the programming and management of structural funding designed to co-finance urban actions that are eligible under the operational programmes, and to delegate implementation to them;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Member States and/or their local authorities, on the basis of the Finnish Presidency's proposal on 'Health in All Policies', to ensure that, when they draft housing programmes to be carried out with the aid of Community funding, local authorities conduct health impact assessments in order to provide the socially excluded with a living environment that is suitable from the environmental and health points of view;\n",
        "20. Stresses the need for dialogue and consultation between the various tiers of local, regional and government authorities, in order to ensure that public action is consistent and socially responsible and relies upon coordination that is horizontal (addressing all Community housing policies), vertical (among those dealing with housing at the various levels, European, national, regional and local) and mixed (among public authorities, social and economic interest groups and civil society); calls, moreover, for strong participation by residents and their organisations with the aim of reaching joint decisions on the revitalisation, redevelopment, management and preservation of the urban environment;\n",
        "21. Encourages greater coordination of financial flows and policies affecting housing, in particular ensuring that the actions supported by the ERDF, the JESSICA and JEREMIE financial instruments, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and the other Community, national, regional and local measures concerning housing and urban redevelopment are complementary, and specifically ensuring that residential buildings in historic city districts are modernised and renovated;\n",
        "22. Hopes that, in the context of the revision of the regulations governing cohesion policy planned for 2009, the debate will be reopened on extending access to Community funds for the renovation of social housing to all Member States in order to save energy and protect environment, which is currently provided for only for certain countries, given that housing needs are critical throughout Europe; asks the Commission and the EIB to implement the Jessica initiative under the same conditions in all countries, including housing within an integrated development approach;\n",
        "23. Encourages the Member States concerned to make full use of the funds made available for housing from the ERDF;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission to ensure, when monitoring intervention by the Structural Funds, that recital 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 is implemented in full for the funding of housing using European structural funds and that appropriate accommodation is being provided for disadvantaged sections of the population by such subsidised housing through social rents and rent control that match the public subsidy; 25 Confirms its support for the strengthening of the partnership between the public authorities, social and economic interest groups and civil society and stresses the potential importance of  public-private partnerships,  especially in the modernisation of prefabricated buildings and the regeneration of brownfield sites;\n",
        "26. Supports the Commission’s campaign for sustainable energy, which is aimed at making European citizens aware of the need to reduce domestic consumption; also encourages the Commission to promote a wide-ranging information campaign, as part of its energy efficiency action plan;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to facilitate the widespread use in the housing sector of new technologies and more efficient building products that enable less energy to be consumed;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to take practical follow-up action to its pilot project in the social housing sector under the SAVE programme[8], in order to promote and disseminate the exemplary energy efficiency projects selected;\n",
        "29. Stresses the importance of exchanging best practices in housing policy and encourages the Commission to develop thematic networks for housing along the lines of those established under the URBACT programme; welcomes with interest, therefore, the Commission’s initiative ‘Regions for economic change’ (COM(2006)0675) and awaits the submission of the implementing arrangements for this initiative;\n",
        "30. Encourages the Commission to set up a website in all official languages of the Union to serve as a forum for cooperation and the exchange of information and best practices similar to the European Urban Knowledge Network (EUKN);\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission to prepare a study showing how powers and responsibilities are divided among national, regional and local levels and setting out the legal framework for housing in all the Member States; believes that such a study would allow considered decisions to be made and possible areas of EU action with regard to housing to be identified, so that Community measures provide real added value compared to national, regional and local measures;\n",
        "32. Strongly supports the idea of simplifying bureaucracy at all levels in order to make spatial planning and management more effective;\n",
        "33. Stresses the importance of the training of operators at grass-roots level, including specific training in urban planning, construction, redevelopment, management and the preservation of existing buildings, and welcomes the funding of training courses under the European Social Fund (ESF);\n",
        "34. Stresses how important it is for spatial management authorities to take into account the accessibility of housing, public services and urban transport for disabled people and to plan exercise and recreation areas for children and young people when framing spatial planning policies, planning what action to take and implementing that action;\n",
        "35. Encourages the EIB Group and the Commission, under Jeremie and in synergy with the Jessica initiative, to establish a strategy for boosting the building sector, chiefly in the new Member States, which would constitute structural aid for developing housing and involve the mobilisation of local and regional resources geared to urban projects;\n",
        "36. Encourages national, regional and local authorities to identify the different circumstances of the cities and territories in the Member States and to draw up and review their housing policies in accordance with the principle of sustainability;\n",
        "37. Calls upon national, regional and local authorities to urgently address one of the priorities of housing policy, namely that of eliminating homelessness;\n",
        "38. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the governments of the Member States, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.\n"
