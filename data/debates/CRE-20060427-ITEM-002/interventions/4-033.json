{"speaker": "Viviane Reding,", "english": "Viviane Reding, Member of the Commission . Madam President, let me once again express my thanks to the rapporteur and in particular to the political groups of the European Parliament, who, together and almost unanimously, think that eCall represents an important advance that is in the interests of European citizens.\nWith this strong support from Parliament, the Commission will continue its efforts aimed at the introduction of the pan-European eCall by 2009. In particular, we will pursue further signatures to the eCall Memorandum of Understanding, and we will follow the progress in implementing the appropriate emergency services infrastructure for 112. By the way, I have launched 11 infringement procedures against Member States, because they have to implement it. Parliament is right: let us implement it at once and in the right way so that it serves our citizens.\nI will also work relentlessly with all other stakeholders whose commitment is necessary for implementing eCall, and I would like to inform Parliament that on 18 October 2005 I invited all the Member States to a high-level meeting to discuss progress and to obtain further commitment on the roadmap for the implementation of eCall as a pan-European in-vehicle emergency 112 call. There were 21 Member States present as well as Norway and the representatives unanimously supported the realisation of the in-vehicle emergency call, as well as the roadmap prepared by the industry. Since that meeting, my services have been in constant liaison with Member States, and several eCall conferences have been held at national level: in Helsinki, Lisbon, Budapest, Madrid and elsewhere. Therefore, things are moving. I am sure today’s action by Parliament will be very important in speeding this up.\nWe are also launching a Eurobarometer survey to collect citizens’ views on 112, on eCall and on other such issues. You will get the results later this year as soon as they are available.\nWhile I am speaking about all the stakeholders, I would like to briefly mention the insurance industry. They said, and I quote, ‘there is a complete lack of any viable evidence to support the view that insurers will derive any benefit from eCall’. I would like to remind the insurance industry that eCall is not about making money, it is about saving lives, and I hope that there will be a review of this position after the very important vote Parliament is going to take.\nI would also like to say a word about standardisation. Standardisation of the data transmission protocol and signalling are urgently needed to enable the design work and investments to go ahead and, here, commercial interest should not block the work of the standardisation organisations. We now have a full consensus on the eCall specification and functionality, and I would like to urge all stakeholders, and especially the mobile network operators, to support the appropriate standardisation work in ETSI and CEN so that this work can be finalised as soon as possible.\nI should like to say a very heartfelt ‘thank you’ to the rapporteur and to all Members from all the political groups who will help us, not only today but also tomorrow, to make eCall a very important European project. It needs the support of all of the European stakeholders. Today we have achieved an important milestone.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Viviane Reding, Member of the Commission .
