    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Believes that EPAs must be designed as instruments for development and that they must contribute to increased economic growth, regional integration and the reduction of poverty;\n",
        "2.  Reaffirms  its view that, if appropriately designed, EPAs represent an opportunity to revitalise ACP – EU trading relations, promote ACP economic diversification and regional integration and to reduce poverty in the ACP countries;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure policy coherence for development; stresses that the \"European Consensus on Development\" (Development Policy Statement, DSP), in particular paragraph 36, provides the EPA negotiators with guidance; urges, in this respect, the Commission to adhere to the principles of asymmetry and flexibility;\n",
        "4.  Recognises that  it is important for the ACP countries to  fully assume their responsibility for the economic partnership process and to promote the reforms needed to bring social and economic structures into line with the agreements; urges ACP governments to implement good governance rules, drawing, inter alia, on the technical assistance provided for under the Aid for Trade instrument;\n",
        "5.  Recalls that, by the end of the EPA negotiations no ACP country should in its trade relations find itself in a more unfavourable situation after 2007 than under current arrangements;\n",
        "6.  Expresses concern at the slow pace of the negotiations and the consequent lack of tangible progress, with many critical issues yet to be discussed or agreed upon;\n",
        "7.  Urges negotiators to increase their efforts to complete negotiations before the end of 2007; urges the Commission to show more flexibility towards ACP concerns;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission  not to exert undue pressure and - in the event of negotiations not being completed by 1 January 2008 - make efforts at WTO level to seek to ensure  that disruption of existing ACP exports to the EU is avoided pending a final settlement;\n",
        "9.  Calls for greater transparency on the progress and substance of the negotiations; calls for all parties to ensure that parliamentarians and other stakeholders in the ACP countries and the EU are consulted  on the EPA negotiations so as to achieve an appropriate implementation of EPAs;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to do its utmost to restart the negotiations on the DDA and ensure that the liberalisation agreements promote development in poor countries;\n",
        "11. Is convinced that EPAs should be complementary to an agreement on the DDA and not an alternative and that a pro-development conclusion to EPAs could be a first step in a development-focused multilateral agreement;\n",
        "12. Recognises that preferential market access has not been a sufficient tool in itself to bring about the development of the ACP countries and maintains that, in order to achieve that goal, flanking measures need to be put in place to boost their competitiveness;\n",
        "13. Calls for full duty-free, quota-free market access for the ACP as well as simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin in EPAs than is the case under EBA, taking into account the differences in the level of industrial development between the EU and the ACP countries as well as among ACP countries;\n",
        "14. Calls for the pacing, timing and scope of liberalisation to be gradual and flexible in order to improve ACP regional integration and competitiveness, and to ensure that development objectives, such as the avoidance of adverse social impacts, particularly towards women, are given priority;\n",
        "15. Urges ACP countries to resolve the problem pertaining to the membership of overlapping regional groups;\n",
        "16. Calls for negotiators to develop a strategy for diversifying , modernising , and boosting ACP competitiveness – particularly in the agricultural sector – thus going beyond market access;\n",
        "17. Recognises that workable safeguard mechanisms, allowing ACP regions to counter surges in imports from the EU, are essential, particularly for agricultural products;\n",
        "18. Calls on the EU to promote Fair Trade and other means to improve conditions for small and marginalised producers and poor workers;\n",
        "19. Reminds the negotiators that in improving agricultural competitiveness strategies in ACP countries due regard should be paid to food security;\n",
        "20. Stresses that it is essential to ensure that ACP countries preserve the right to protect some sensitive products;\n",
        "21. Recognises that the Sustainable Impact Assessments (SIAs) have failed to have a meaningful impact on negotiations and calls on the Commission to clarify and review the link between SIAs and negotiating positions in order to give stakeholders the opportunity to be heard;\n",
        "22. Calls for an appropriate and transparent monitoring mechanism - with a clear role and influence - to be set up at  both regional and national levels in order to follow the impact of EPAs  with increased ACP ownership and broad stakeholder consultation;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Council and the Commission to clarify the extent to which the financing of the \"development dimension\" of EPAs will be available beyond the 10th European Development Fund (EDF);\n",
        "24. Welcomes the conclusion of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 16 October 2006 that \"a substantial share of the Community and Member States’ commitment to increase their trade-related assistance to EUR 2 billion by 2010 has to be devoted to the ACP countries\", though regrets that not all of this money is\"additional to EDF resources\" and urges the Commission and Member States to clarify the precise terms of these commitments, to guarantee that this assistance is not conditional on the outcome of EPA negotiations, and to work towards  significantly increasing the amount of available Aid for Trade as demand from ACP states increases;\n",
        "25. Endorses the Council's invitation to the Commission and the Member States to support \"as an immediate priority the implementation of EPA-related reform commitments\" and calls for concrete commitments to be made prior to the conclusion of EPA negotiations, which are detailed, quantified and specifically EPA-related, addressing both trade-related assistance and the adjustment costs associated with EPAs;\n",
        "26. Calls for EPA support to be coordinated and linked to the multi-lateral Aid for Trade enhanced integrated framework;\n",
        "27. Insists that, in keeping with the Paris Principles on Aid Effectiveness, aid must be,  inter alia, demand-driven, and calls on the ACP, therefore,to  put forward, with appropriate EU-assistance where required, detailed, costed proposals of how and for what additional EPA-related funds are needed, particularly with regard to regulatory frameworks, safeguard measures, trade facilitation, support in meeting international Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Intellectual Property standards and  the composition of the EPA monitoring mechanism;\n",
        "28. Asks the Commission, when requested,  to provide ACP countries with additional technical assistance  for trade negotiations;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Commission to provide assistance, when requested, to ACP countries deciding to undertake fiscal reform programmes;\n",
        "30. Notes the  poor level of revenue collection in many ACP countries and calls for additional support to be  given  towards tax reforms and measures for the  prevention  of tax evasion, as part of a strategy to minimise the effect of lost tariff revenues;\n",
        "31. Recalls that ACP countries are often heavily dependent on primary commodities, and calls on the EU to develop more effective instruments of support to production adjustment and diversification, as well as the development of processing industries and SMEs in ACP countries;\n",
        "32. Understands  ACP reluctance to negotiate bilaterally on so-called Singapore issues which have been removed from multilateral negotiations and recognises that it is for ACP regional groups to judge the development benefits of any agreements on these issues but highlights the development benefits that  those issues may engender;\n",
        "33. Believes that appropriately framed agreements on investment, competition and government procurement, accompanied by a credible regulatory environment, could contribute to shared aims of good governance and transparency, creating an environment that should enable greater private-public partnership, particularly in relation to key infrastructure development;\n",
        "34. Expresses disappointment that so far insufficient advantage has been taken of the opportunity provided by the review to involve parliamentarians and other stakeholders; believes that the inclusion of key stakeholders and civil society representatives would add a crucial practical and pragmatic dimension to this process;\n",
        "35. Recognises the social and environmental responsibilities of foreign businesses and investors towards the communities and societies in which they invest; believes that people-to-people business and investment contacts should be encouraged and facilitated in order to maximise the social and economic benefits of increased liberalisation;\n",
        "36. Urges the Commission and the ACP countries to use the EPA review as an opportunity to  openly discuss the obstacles to the completion of  negotiations and to put forward detailed proposals to overcome them;\n",
        "37. Recalls ACP requests in a number of fora for alternatives to EPAs, but notes the absence of official ACP requests under Article 37(6) of the Cotonou Agreement;\n",
        "38. Asks  the Commission, in accordance with Article 37(6) of the Cotonou Agreement, where non-least developed ACP countries are not in a position to enter into EPAs, to examine  possible ways of offering those countries an alternative framework for trade, which is equivalent to the existing situation and which is in conformity with WTO rules;\n",
        "39. Asks  the Commission to make proposals for development-oriented alternatives that offer more than mere market access, as is the case for EBA and GSP+;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Commission to promote social standards and decent work in the EPA trade negotiations;\n",

        "43. Recalls that bilateral negotiations on trade in services should respect the right of countries to freely regulate public services and asks  both parties to recognisethat sound regulatory frameworks are an essential part of anyliberalisation process;\n",
        "44. Calls for the EU not to include in EPAs provisions that constitute  an additional barrier to access to essential medicines  and to use the EPA system  to help ACP countries implement the forms of flexibility provided for in the Doha Declaration;\n",
        "45. Stresses that the regional aspect of EPAs is essential for  boosting not only North-South but also South-South trade; considers that insufficient attention has been paid to that matter by the European sideand that achieving proper intra-regional integration may even be more important than launching a programme for inter-regional integration;\n",
        "46. Calls for a dispute settlement system for EPAs which is sufficiently simple and cost-effective, to promptly intervene when parties fail to meet their commitments;\n",
        "47. Calls for appropriate proposals to be made in order to address ACP concerns on Mode IV of the GATS;\n",
        "48. Recognises that high phytosanitary and other EU health and environmental standards may hinder ACP exports, particularly of agricultural goods, and calls on the Commission and Member States to help ACP countries to devise adequateprogrammes to reach these standards in a timely fashion;\n",

        "52. Calls for the creation of a Parliamentary Oversight Committee on EPAs - within the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly and not as an additional institution - to publicly monitor and review the trade and development impact of EPA implementation, to improve policy coherence for development  and to design mechanisms  to ensure accountability and regular reporting of EPAs contribution to  equitable and sustainable development ;\n",
