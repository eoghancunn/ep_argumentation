The ambiguity of the European Union purpose when we come to the enlargement policy is an obstacle which no rapporteur could overcome. This report is a victim of such ambiguity.\nOur duty and our ultimate scope is to grant security to our citizens. Our citizens feel unprotected. In order to protect them, the European Union needs power. In order to be powerful in a global world, the European Union needs both enlargement and internal reform. Since we failed to tell our citizens that the rights they have already acquired are not sustainable, they think that they can preserve those rights by opposing both enlargement and reform. Under such circumstances the future of the European Union is in jeopardy.\nEnlargement is not a concession made to the candidate countries. Some of them, such as Ukraine, Serbia, Moldova and Turkey, have alternatives – maybe worse, but alternatives. In these cases we are in competition with others. Some of their internal problems could be solved better inside, rather than outside, the European Union. If we do not offer them prospects, we do not offer our citizens security.\nIt is not the candidate countries or the new Member States that are indigestible: our digestive system is too slow.
