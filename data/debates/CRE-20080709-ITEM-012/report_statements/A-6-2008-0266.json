    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Agrees with the Commission that past enlargements have generally been a great success, benefiting the old as well as the new EU Member States by fostering economic growth, promoting social progress and bringing peace, stability, freedom and prosperity to the European continent; believes that lessons can be learned from previous accessions and that further ways of improving the quality of the enlargement process must be based on the positive experiences accumulated so far;\n",
        "2.  Reaffirms its firm commitment to all candidate countries and to those which have been given clear membership prospects, with the understanding that full and rigorous compliance with all the criteria laid down in Copenhagen is imperative,that the Union must make efforts to strengthen itsintegration capacityand that this capacity should be fully taken into account;\n",
        "3.  Recalls in this context that, for the countries of the former Yugoslavia, full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is also a sine qua non;\n",
        "4.  Takes the view that the Union's Enlargement Strategy should comply with the provisions of the EU Treaty and reflect the commitments already entered into by the Union, as well as striking a balance between the Union's geo-strategic interests, the impact of political developments outside its borders, and the Union's integration capacity, including its ability to cope with future internal and external challenges and to realise its political integration project;\n",
        "5.  Recalls in this context the need to undertake the necessary internal reforms, aimed at,inter alia, increasing efficiency, social cohesion and strengthening democratic accountability;\n",
        "6.  Recalls that integration capacity is linked to the Union's ability at a given point in time to decide and thus toachieve its political objectives, in particular the aim of promoting economic and social progress and a high level of employment in its Member States, of asserting its identity and its ability to act on the international scene, of promoting the rights and interests of Member States and European citizens alike, of developing an area of freedom, security and justice, of fully maintaining and building on itsacquis communautaireand of upholding fundamental rights and freedoms, as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union;\n",
        "7.  Considers that the concept of integration capacity comprises four elements: (i)    accession states should contribute to and not impair the ability of the Union to maintain momentum towards the fulfilment of its political objectives; (ii)   the institutional framework of the Union should be able to deliver efficient and effective government; (iii)   the financial resources of the Union should be adequate to meet the challenges of social and economic cohesion and of the Union's common policies; (iv)  a comprehensive communication strategy should be in place to inform public opinion about the implications of enlargement;\n",
        "8.  Stresses that, in order to enhance the credibility and the effectiveness of the enlargement strategy, the Copenhagen criteria must be fully respected and complied with by Member States as well, in order to avoid requiring of applicant countries higher standards than those applied in some parts of the Union;\n",
        "9.  Recalls, furthermore, that the economic structure and interests of each new Member State could have an impact on the direction which the Union's policies and budget take and that the policy adaptations required could affect the nature of the Union itself; recalls that a cohesive Community of nations and citizens must be based on coherent policies and solidarity of interests;\n",
        "10. Considers that the budgetary as well as the broader economic and social implications of further possible enlargements must be taken into due consideration during the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 multi-annual financial framework and the drafting of subsequent financial frameworks;\n",
        "11. Is also convinced that any acceding State should try to resolve itsmain internalproblems, particularly those concerning its territorial and constitutional set-up, before it can join the Union; takes the view that, before and during the negotiations with any such State, the European Union should assist in resolving those issues;\n",
        "12. Endorses the emphasis on consolidation, conditionality and communication as guiding principles of the EU Enlargement Strategy;\n",
        "13. Takes the view that every enlargement must be followed by adequate consolidation and political concentration, that is to say, by a serious reassessment of the Union's policies and means in order torespondto the expectations of European citizens and to guaranteethe viability of the Union as a political project;\n",
        "14. Is concerned that enlargement without adequate consolidation and preparation coulddamage the Union’s internal cohesion and could haveserious implications for the Union's capacity to act – since it would weaken its institutions, make Member States more vulnerable to external pressure and undermine the Union’s credibility as global actor;\n",
        "15. Believes, moreover, that the success of the enlargement process (and, thus, the success of the EU political integration process) can only be achieved if there is clear and long-lasting public support for the EU membership of each candidate country; is therefore of the view that further enlargements should be accompanied by a concerted communication policy involving all EU Institutions and Member States' Governments, as well as representatives of civil society, and that this communication policy should bedesigned to explain to our citizens the political, economic, social and cultural benefits of enlargement; therefore reminds the governments and parliaments of the Member States that it is their responsibility adequately to inform public opinion about the positive achievements of former enlargements, the status quo of the ongoing negotiations and the issues connected with the accession of new Member States;\n",
        "16. Takes the view that countries with European prospects should make every effort to explain, involve and prepare their public opinion for integration into the Union, involving civil society in this process from the outset;\n",
        "17. Is also convinced that the Enlargement Strategy should be flanked by a more diversified range of external contractual frameworks and that these frameworks could be structured as mutually permeable concentric circles, with countries being offered the opportunity, under strict but clear internal and external conditions, to move from one status to another if they so wish and if they fulfil the criteria pertaining to each specific framework;\n",
        "18. Affirms that participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy does not constitute, either in principle or in practice,a substitute for membership or a stage leading necessarily to membership; takes the view that the conceptual, political and legalgap existing between the Union's Enlargement Strategy and its Neighbourhood Policy needs to be filled in order to respond to the expectations of our eastern neighbours; is convinced that the Commission's strengthened neighbourhood policy is not sufficient in this respect, although it represents an already positive step in the right direction, and that a more substantive qualitative change is required;\n",
        "19. Suggests, therefore, that, as regards those eastern neighbours which, in view of their political, economic and social situation and the Union's current integration capacity, at present do not enjoy membership prospects but at the same time fulfil certain democratic and economic conditions, the Union should establish an area based on common policies covering, in particular, the rule of law, democracy and human rights, foreign and security policy cooperation, economic and financial issues, trade, energy, transport, environmental issues, justice, security, migration, visa-free movement and education; takes the view that these common policies should pursue the overall goal of assisting the eastern neighboursgradually to achieve EU standards and thus open the way for their closer integration into the European fold; is also convinced that the common policiesreferred to above should be shaped jointly with the participating countries on the basis of specific decision-making mechanisms, and should be underpinned by adequate financial assistance; takes a positive view of the Polish-Swedish proposal submitted to the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 26-27 May 2008, provided that the initiative which that proposal involves is pursued within the framework of the European Union;\n",
        "20. Welcomes the re-launch, within the framework of the EU, of the \"Barcelona Process: A Union for the Mediterranean\" as a positive step in our relations with the southern neighbours; believes that this new development strengthens the argument in favour of specific contractual multilateral relations also with our eastern neighbours, which, compared to their southern partners, have clear European ambitions and perspectives; recalls that, as a first step, these relations shouldtranslate themselves into the establishment of a Free Trade Area, to be followed by closer relations along the lines of a European Economic Area Plus (EEA +), of a European Commonwealth or of specific regional cooperation frameworks;\n",
        "21. Reiterates, in the context of the above specific regional cooperation frameworks, the importance of devising a more sophisticated and comprehensive EU strategy for the Black Sea region, that goes beyond the current synergy initiative and envisages the establishment of a Union for the Black Sea, which should include the EU, Turkey and all Black Sea littoral states as equal partners, while seeking the full involvement of Russia; believes that such a multilateral framework would not only offer the countries involved the possibility of strengthening their cooperation with the EU across a wide variety of policy fields, but would also allow the European Union to play a more active role in finding peaceful solutions to the region's conflicts, thus contributing positively to security in the region;\n",
        "22. Believes at the same time that countries which enjoy recognised membership prospects but still have considerable ground to cover before they can attain the political, economic and social conditions necessary to achieve candidate status, could usefully participate, on a totally voluntary basis, in arrangements similar to the above-mentioned bilateral or multilateral frameworks; recalls that such anintermediate step would facilitate the deployment of all instruments available to the European Union in order to help the countries concerned on their path towardsfull membership;\n",
        "23. Welcomes in this context the Commission Communication on the Western Balkans of 5 March 2008 (COM(2008)0128), which outlines a range of measures for supporting the countries in the region in their efforts towards EU integration and for deepening our relations with them, whether in the areas of trade, energy, education and/or research;  expresses satisfaction at the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements with Serbia and with Bosnia-Herzegovina, which it regards as a further step in consolidating the ties between that region and the EU; calls in this respect for the negotiations for visa liberalisation with the countries of the Western Balkans to be speeded up, in order to facilitate their participation in Community programmes;\n",
        "24. Urges the Commission to come up with concrete proposals for a more diversified external relations policy towards our neighbours, along the lines outlined in the present resolution, and, when considering its own administrative set-up, at least to establish a link between the activities carried out by the Enlargement and the RELEX Directorates-General;\n",
        "25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
