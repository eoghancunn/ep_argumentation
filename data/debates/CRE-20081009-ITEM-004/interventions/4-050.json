{"speaker": "Bogusław Sonik (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Bogusław Sonik (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mr Peterle on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, entitled ‘Together for Health: a Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’. In particular, I welcome this report because it deals with one of the most urgent challenges facing the European Union and the entire world. It should be highlighted that this is the first strategic programme presenting a comprehensive Union approach to health policy. It lays down the values adopted by the Community and the aims it is setting itself in this area. It amounts to a Union healthcare strategy that stands out against other health systems, and could indeed serve as an example for the latter.\nI am glad to hear that the strategy has been positively received in the Member States. I am also glad to learn that certain countries have already taken action with a view to developing a common standpoint and incorporating the strategy into their national health plans. Slovenia is but one example. Action of this nature has also been taken in Poland.\nThe financing of healthcare services makes a significant contribution to the budget deficit in many countries of the European Union. It is essential to take this fact into account when considering health strategy. Accordingly, I believe that the strategic plan should be considered in conjunction with methods of financing public healthcare in the Member States.\nI should also like to mention an issue that we have previously debated. I am referring to new information technologies and their effect on children and young people. Unregulated use of the Internet and computer games, addiction and related conditions are becoming increasingly serious problems for our society and civilisation. Children and young people are the worst affected. The Commission and the European Council are currently developing a sound method of cooperating in the healthcare area and it would be right for us to be involved in the implementation of this project.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bogusław Sonik (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mr Peterle on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, entitled ‘Together for Health: a Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’.
