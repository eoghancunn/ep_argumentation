The European Union’s goal must be to eliminate the disparities between the new and old Member States, which are still quite significant.\nSince the individual Member States have different goals in the area of health policy, the health sector across the European Union needs long-term and strategic cooperation so that consensus can be reached. It is also necessary to invest in prevention and public education programmes. Better results can be achieved with a prevention policy and it is well known that almost half of all diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles.\nI agree with Mr Peterle’s request to the Commission to draw up a long-term plan for preventive actions for the above reason. This could help to improve the European population’s state of health. Research in medical areas also contributes to prevention and makes diseases easier to cure. For example, the European Union does not invest enough funds in cancer research: EU investment is almost one fifth of what the US invests. Rectifying this shortcoming would be in the interest of all European citizens.\nA useful idea in terms of raising patient awareness is the establishment of information and guidance centres to help patients, the healthcare personnel and the entire health sector. Once these goals are met, the European Union will be much closer to achieving a common approach to health.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Irena Belohorská (NI). - (SK) When we talk about the European Union’s common approach to health, our first consideration must be consolidating standards for the provision of healthcare services.
