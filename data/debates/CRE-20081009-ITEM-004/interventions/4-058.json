This should not, however, represent an obstacle when it comes to taking joint action aimed at protecting the health of Europeans. The key objectives are laid down in the White Paper. They include promoting health in an ageing Europe, protecting citizens against dangers to their health and supporting dynamic health systems. These objectives cannot be achieved without substantial involvement by local and regional authorities.\nThe latter must therefore be fully involved in implementation of this strategy. The White Paper raises the important issue of health inequalities and of the variations in health levels between individual countries and social groups. The provision of certain healthcare services in most of the new Member States is low. This gap must be bridged. It is therefore necessary to strengthen action aimed at doing away with inequality and to make this a priority objective.\nAnother task identified in the White Paper relates to the need to emphasise and enhance the importance of programmes involving health awareness, notably those concerning nutrition. Sound nutrition and a healthy lifestyle can prevent many chronic diseases. That is why educational programmes on how to watch one’s diet and engage in physical activity from a very early age are so very important.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Czesław Adam Siekierski (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, matters relating to health fall within the competence of individual Member States.
