{"speaker": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Kuźmiuk (UEN). -", "english": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Kuźmiuk (UEN). - (PL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to three issues in this debate. Firstly, there are notable health inequalities between the old and the new Member States. The cumulative effect of these inequalities is manifested in significant differences in terms of life expectancy. This can vary by 9 years for women and by as much as 13 years for men. We should strive to achieve a substantial reduction of these differences.\nSecondly, a substantial increase in investment aimed at disease prevention is needed. To date, barely 3% of investment is allocated to this purpose. It is well known, however, that up to 40% of diseases are linked to an unhealthy lifestyle and could largely be effectively prevented.\nThirdly, as obesity is becoming an increasingly serious disease of our civilisation, it is essential to promote a healthy lifestyle. Favourable terms should also be made available for healthy organic food produced without the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides. This type of farming is not very cost-effective, however. It therefore requires increased financial support within the framework of the common agricultural system.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Kuźmiuk (UEN). - (PL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to three issues in this debate.
