{"speaker": "Åsa Westlund (PSE). -", "english": "Åsa Westlund (PSE). - (SV) Mr President, I wanted to speak about two things. The first is how we must deal with excessive antibiotics prescription, which is handled very well in the report.\nWe need only look at ourselves here in the European Parliament, or I need only look at myself. I would probably not be standing here today if we did not have effective antibiotics. I have been ill a number of times and just like many of you here in this Chamber, I am sure, have been saved by antibiotics. Unfortunately, our children’s chances of getting this kind of help in the future are being jeopardised because we allow doctors to prescribe antibiotics when they are not needed and even sell antibiotics without a prescription.\nWe need means of control and incentives to stop doctors meeting with patients to make money, so that they do not prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary. I believe that the EU has an extremely important role to play here, to disseminate different ways of working successfully to combat this kind of excessive prescription.\nThe second question which I wanted to address concerns inequality in health, which has also been raised by several earlier speakers. There is another aspect of inequality in health. It is not just a matter of inequality between countries. There is also inequality within countries. The WHO organised a special commission which looked at class differences in health. It boldly stated that ‘social justice is a matter of life and death’ and this is something which we must discuss openly in the Union.\nIt is completely unacceptable that there are such big differences within countries. There are good examples where class differences in health have been successfully overcome, but there are also very bad examples. I myself am very concerned at what is happening in the capital of my own country. A system has suddenly been introduced there as a result of which doctors are moving away from socially deprived and poor areas, where medical care is most needed, to areas where people are healthiest and most wealthy.\nI believe that the EU should collect statistics and information so that voters, and also those who take decisions on health care, can be given clear advice on what measures lead to greater social justice in health and which do not.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Åsa Westlund (PSE). - (SV) Mr President, I wanted to speak about two things.
