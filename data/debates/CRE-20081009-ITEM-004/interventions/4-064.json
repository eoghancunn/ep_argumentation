{"speaker": "Gyula Hegyi (PSE),", "english": "Gyula Hegyi (PSE), in writing . – ( HU ) Allergy is the endemic disease of our time. It has marched steadily across Europe since the Second World War. A third of our children have an allergy, and if we do not take action, pretty soon a half of the population of Europe will suffer from one allergy or another. The causes of these allergies are chemically treated foods and polluted environments. The symptoms of allergy are triggered by chemicals, natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollen and other natural substances, and animal hair. In Hungary, ragweed is a particular problem.\nUnfortunately the European Union has no allergy strategy at present, as the Commission confirmed in response to my question. Allergy sufferer associations within civil society, and millions of affected European citizens, are counting on the introduction of allergy legislation at European level. Let us do something to help prevent allergies, to tackle the main causes and to safeguard those who suffer from allergies. Active engagement would underpin our focus on the health of the citizens of the European Union and their everyday concerns.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gyula Hegyi (PSE), in writing . – ( HU ) Allergy is the endemic disease of our time.
