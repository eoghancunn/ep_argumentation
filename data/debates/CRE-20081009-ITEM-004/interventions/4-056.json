This is why the exchange of best practices in all medical assistance fields within the European Union will contribute to increasing citizen welfare and health. I believe it is important to promote a healthy lifestyle inside families, in schools and at work in order to set the path for a healthy life model and to promote healthy ageing, both for the current generation and future ones.\nWe must be especially concerned about our children’s interests, developing provisions concerning maternity and parental leave, taking into consideration the effect the presence of parents has on a child’s physical and mental development. It is just as important to improve the medical care system for pregnant women and to inform them about the effects of smoking and drinking.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Daciana Octavia Sârbu (PSE). - (RO) To respond the major challenges that the health sector is facing in the European Union, we need action plans which should include promoting a better state of health , public education and disease prevention programmes, especially for those diseases related to food, obesity, alcohol and drug consumption and smoking.\nEarly detection and diagnosis, as well as the supply of proper treatment for chronic diseases, especially cancer, will ensure quality of life for people who are affected by these illnesses.
