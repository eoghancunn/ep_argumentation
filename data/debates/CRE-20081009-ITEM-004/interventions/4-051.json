{"speaker": "Anne Ferreira (PSE). -", "english": "Anne Ferreira (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which has improved on the initial text.\nThis White Paper proposed by the Commission is a first step in setting clear and beneficial objectives in the field of health, but it is unfortunate that it does not respond to the challenges of quality healthcare and equal access. The report on the table today has not taken over the initial proposals concerning self-medication and that is a good thing. In my opinion, trivialising or even encouraging self-medication is totally inappropriate in terms of the healthcare we must strive towards. ‘Together for Health’ must not become ‘every man for himself in times of illness’.\nThe introduction of the idea of an active patient is a worrying concept: because it is not accompanied by a clear definition, the door is left open to different interpretations. Encouraging patients to take responsibility for their own care and urging population groups to provide their own responses to certain health needs are further proposals that must be treated carefully. We must remember that health is a very specific field that requires a very high level of competence and the issues involved can often be a matter of life and death. The proposals encouraging self-medication, in conjunction with the concept of individual responsibility, do not seem to respond to the health challenge we have to tackle and they move away from the concepts of solidarity.\nThere is one other point that I must criticise: facilitating the mobility of health professionals. This could have very serious consequences on the territorial distribution of health personnel and aggravate what are already very precarious situations in certain Member States. Rather than encouraging the mobility of health professionals, it would be preferable to put the emphasis on the exchange of good health practices among all the Member States. I also recognise that web-based health resources must be encouraged. This is a positive and innovative initiative that is nevertheless only available to a minority of people.\nI naturally support the amendments tabled by my colleagues concerning health in the workplace. This is a crucial topic because work-related health problems are becoming more and more common.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Anne Ferreira (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which has improved on the initial text.\nThis White Paper proposed by the Commission is a first step in setting clear and beneficial objectives in the field of health, but it is unfortunate that it does not respond to the challenges of quality healthcare and equal access.
