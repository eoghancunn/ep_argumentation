My initiatives have been received favourably by both ENVI and the Committee on Budgets.\nAs Mr Peterle has pointed out, there is a close connection between the new health hazards and climate change. On 7 October, the Committee on Budgets adopted a research project I proposed, ‘Comprehensive Research on Health, the Environment and Climate Change – Improvement in Inside and Outside Air Quality’. This 4-million-euro initiative will be managed by the Hungarian headquarters of the Regional Environmental Centre for central and eastern Europe (REC) and will cover nine countries (Austria, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Serbia and Slovakia). At the same time the project will examine the links between health, environmental protection, transport and climate change and their effects in schools.\nAs regards ECDC ratification, I also support the rapporteur. So that the Agency can meet its increased responsibilities, I suggested releasing it from the margin set by the Commission. ENVI adopted this unanimously, and it is to be hoped that at the end of the October plenary Parliament will decide on this too.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE), in writing. – ( HU ) First, I would like to say how happy I am that we have recently seen more and more reports and strategies on the importance of health.\nI myself as a 2009 Budget expert have tried to speak for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI).
