    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the above-mentioned Commission White Paper on a Community health strategy for the period 2008-2013 and supports the values, principles, strategic goals and specific actions set out therein;\n",
        "2.  Believes that, given the existence of new threats to health, there is a need to address health as a key political issue in the Lisbon Strategy, which includes the need to provide citizens with access to decent health care of the highest quality available to ensure a healthy and competitive workforce;\n",
        "3.  Deplores the fact that the White Paper does not set specific quantifiable and measurable objectives whose attainment could produce tangible results, and recommends that such objectives be adopted;\n",
        "4.  Stresses that health care needs the support of effective policies in all areas and at all levels in the Member States and the EU (‘Health in All Policies’) and at a global level;\n",
        "5.  Stresses the fundamental importance of recognising the right of men and women to have a greater say on matters concerning their health and its care and the right of children to unconditional protection of their health, on the basis of the general principles of universality, equality and solidarity;\n",
        "6.  Notes that, according to the WHO, chronic diseases and particularly strokes and heart disease are steadily overtaking infectious diseases;\n",
        "7.  Recommends, as part of efforts to prevent disease, the widespread adoption of the practice of performing health impact assessments, as the impact on human health of the decisions of decision-making bodies at various levels including local and regional authorities and national parliaments is measurable;\n",
        "8.  Stresses that action plans should address, in particular, the causes of certain diseases and the need to reduce and prevent epidemics and pandemics; points out that problems also exist which are linked to gender, such as prostate cancer in the case of men and cervical cancer in the case of women and that specific policies should be developed on these;\n",
        "9.  Recommends that the mandate of the ECDC be extended to non-communicable diseases;\n",
        "10. Proposes that the Commission set as a priority goal a reduction in avoidable health inequalities and inequities between and within Member States, as well as between different social groups and sections of the population, including men and those with mental health problems; moreover, calls on the Member States to fully enforce such Community legislation as the Transparency Directive (89/105/EEC);\n",
        "11. Stresses that actions aimed at reducing inequities in health should include targeted promotion,public education and prevention programmes;\n",
        "12. Believes that disease prevention efforts and vaccination campaigns, where effective products exist, should be stepped up significantly; therefore urges the Commission to draw up an ambitious plan for preventive actions for the entire 5-year period; agrees that spending on health, particularly on prevention and early diagnosis of diseases, is not only a cost but also an investment that could be evaluated in terms of Healthy Life Years (HLYs) as a Lisbon Structural Indicator;\n",
        "13. Underlines the fact that health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity;\n",
        "14. Stresses that access to reliable, independent and comparable information about healthy behaviours, diseases and treatment options is a prerequisite for an effective disease prevention strategy;\n",
        "15. Stresses that the desire to prevent diseases must not lead to a climate in society that would prevent children with a chronic disease or a disability from being born; asks the Commission to promote concrete assistance to parents of children with a chronic disease and/or a disability;\n",
        "16. Stresses furthermore that, in order to promote investment in health, it is vital to measure the effectiveness of investments to date and to publish the findings;\n",
        "17. Stresses the importance of carrying out well-organised, comprehensive and effective screening programmes to facilitate the early detection and immediate treatment of disease, thereby reducing the associated mortality and morbidity;\n",
        "18. Believes that the rights of citizens to have access to health careand their responsibility for their own health should be fundamental in the context of an EU which imposes high health and food safety standards throughout people's lifetimes and calls for further investment in research on health literacy in order to identify the most appropriate strategies to address this issue across different groups of the population; encourages   all sectors of society to lead healthy lifestyles;\n",
        "19. Stresses that the concept of ‘healthy lifestyle’ (i.e. a healthy diet, the absence of drug abuse and sufficient physical activity) needs to be complemented by a psychosocial dimension (i.e. a balanced approach to work and family life); argues that a healthy lifestyle includes good mental and physical health and that these are also important factors in maintaining a competitive economy;\n",
        "20. Expects the Commission to pay particular attention to the question of the sustainability of health systems and, in that context, also to the role and responsibilityof the pharmaceutical industry;\n",
        "21. Welcomes the Commission's intention to define fundamental health values and establish a system of health indicators (at national and sub-national level) and to promote health literacy programmes and programmes to prevent health problems;\n",
        "22. Stresses that the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain, as mentioned in Article 3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, should be considered a guiding principle in the area of health, especially in the field of cell, tissue and organ donation and transplantation;\n",
        "23. Welcomes the Commission's intention, in the spirit of ‘health for all’, to promote health and disease prevention among all age groups; stresses the need to highlight key health-related issues, such as nutrition, obesity, malnutrition, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, drugs and tobacco and environmental risks, including air pollution, both at the workplace and at home, and in compliance with the principle of equality between men and women, providing support for healthy ageing and reducing the burden of chronic illnesses;\n",
        "24. Urges the Commission to take a more holistic approach to nutrition and make malnutrition, alongside obesity, a key priority in the field of health, incorporating it wherever possible into EU-funded research, education and health promotion initiatives and EU-level partnerships;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, in the framework of the EU's health strategy, to work towards the development of guidelines for a common definition of disability, which may include people with chronic illnesses or cancer and, in the meantime, for Member States that have not yet done so, to act as quickly as possible to include such people within their national definitions of disability;\n",
        "26. Furthermore, requests that priority be given to ensuring that persons with disabilities are given equal access to health care and that funding is granted to reflect this focus;\n",
        "27. Demands effective measures to combat antibiotic resistance including measures to make antibiotics prescription only, guidelines to decrease the prescription of antibiotics to limit it to cases in which the use of an antibiotic is indeed necessary, efforts to improve marker tests in order to encourage a more cautious use of antibiotics, and, where appropriate, hygiene codes; calls for special attention to be paid to the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria; points out that the ECDC should monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines and codes;\n",
        "28. Draws the attention of the Commission and Member States to the need to support research and promote the prevention, early diagnosis and suitable treatment of chronic diseases in order to ensure sufferers' welfare and quality of life;\n",
        "29. Acknowledges the vital role of carers in health and health care provision and therefore requests that attention be given to policies which support carers and protect their health alongside the health of those who they care for;\n",
        "30. Notes that in order to facilitate the mobility of health care professionals and ensure patient safety throughout the EU, the sharing of information between Member States and between their respective regulatory bodies for health care professionals is essential;\n",
        "31. In the framework of the EU's health strategy, calls for more effective exchanges of best practices within the EU in all areas of health-care provision, in particular in relation to screening programmes and the diagnosis and treatment of serious illnesses such as cancer;\n",
        "32. Believes that the EU should take further steps to protect health care workers from accidents and injury in the workplace where there is scientific or medical evidence of need;\n",
        "33. Considers that poor application of Community environmental legislation also has an adverse impact on the state of health of European citizens;\n",
        "34. Stresses that, in certain situations, European citizens face health problems such as air pollution which represent a considerable threat to health, affecting the proper development of children and reducing life expectancy in the EU[14];\n",
        "35. Believes that action to promote healthy lifestyles in families, schools,  hospitals, care homes,workplaces and places of leisure is essential to successful disease prevention : and good mental health; recognises that the family is of vital importance in establishing a 'healthy lifestyle' model which is often replicated in later life;\n",
        "36. Draws the attention of the Commission and the Member States to Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which calls for legislative bodies to treat the interests of children as a primary consideration, one way being to make the necessary provision for maternity and parental leave, for health protection and access to health services during maternity, taking into account in particular the effect that parents’ presence and affection, as well as breastfeeding, have on an infant’s mental and physical development;\n",
        "37. Stresses the need to improve health care and information for pregnant and breastfeeding women concerning the risks associated with alcohol, drug and tobacco consumption during pregnancy and breastfeeding;\n",

        "40. Calls on the Commission and Member States to consider the contribution which integrated social and health policies (socially relevant health service provision) could make to a modern approach to the promotion and protection of health, particularly for the most vulnerable sections of the population such as young children and those who are not self-sufficient;\n",
        "41. Believes that the EU should increasingly focus its research programme efforts on important but often neglected patient groups, such as those with mental health problems and men;\n",
        "42. Invites the Commission and the Member States further to explore, in the framework of the strategy, the synergies between scientific and technological research, particularly as regards new kinds of research in medical areas that are currently underfunded, on the one hand, and the development of new medical sectors and therapies on the other, in order to make it possible for everyone to have access to these therapies as they can have a very positive impact on the health status of EU citizens and in terms of increasing the efficiency of the system;\n",
        "43. Welcomes the approach proposed by the Commission with a view to combating effectively the counterfeiting of medicines and encourages the Commission to promote the drafting of an international convention on this subject or the appending of an additional protocol to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (Palermo Convention);\n",
        "44. Calls on  the Commission and the Member States to establish centres of excellence for each important disease group, which should serve as a point of reference, information and guidance for patients and their families, doctors, health care workers, industry and others;\n",
        "45. Points out that regional and local health authorities in many Member States are often responsible for the planning, management, operation and development of the health sector and often also bear the financial responsibility for the sector, have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the health sector and are essential partners in the formulation and implementation of health policy;\n",

        "50. Agrees that actions under the Strategy must be supported by existing financial instruments until the end of the current Financial Framework (2007-2013), without additional budgetary consequences;\n",
        "51. Calls upon the Commission to recommend to Member States,  when they formulate national health strategies,  to include priorities  to be pursued in other projects not confined to the field of public health;\n",
