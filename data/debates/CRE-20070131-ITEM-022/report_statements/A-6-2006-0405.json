    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Calls on the Commission to carry out an inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods on the internal market, and particularly on citizens exercising their freedoms under the Treaty. In particular, this study should seek to quantify the number of personal injury cases involving a cross-border element and assess any difficulties and/or hardship caused to injured parties as a result of the divergence of limitation periods, having regard to the issues set out in recital B;\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Commission to draw up a report on limitation periods following the evaluation of the study, dealing in particular with possible options ranging from a limited harmonisation of limitation periods to the use of a conflict-of-laws rule;\n",
        "3.  Requests the Commission, where appropriate, in the light of the inquiry carried out pursuant to paragraph 1 and after consulting Parliament, to submit to Parliament, on the basis of Article 65(c) and the second indent of Article 67(5) of the EC Treaty, a legislative proposal on limitation periods in respect of personal injury and fatal accident claims in cross-border litigation, following the detailed recommendations below;\n",
        "4. Confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens; calls on the Commission to verify carefully that the principle of subsidiarity and considerations of proportionality are stringently enforced; particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the least intrusive form of legislation is selected and to examining whether, for example, the problem might not be best resolved by introducing the country of origin principle;\n",
        "5.  Considers that the proposal requested must not have any financial implications;\n",
        "6.  Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council and to the Parliaments and Governments of the Member States.\n"
