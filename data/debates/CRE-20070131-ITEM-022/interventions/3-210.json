{"speaker": "Franco Frattini,", "english": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission . I think this report is a very interesting attempt to deal with a very difficult subject. Mrs Wallis is to be congratulated on trying to see a way into a general European solution to the differences in limitation periods as they relate, as she just said, to actions for damages for personal injury and death. This is of particular concern to citizens who have the misfortune to suffer road traffic accidents in countries other than those in which they live. But it could also apply in other matters, such as medical claims and product liability.\nHaving said that, the area of limitation is a complex matter, as the rapporteur also acknowledged. It is very closely linked to prescription, which is not dealt with in the report. Any further work on the subject would need to deal with prescription, since the majority of European legal systems solve the problem of time limits through the use of prescription rather than limitation periods. The UK system uses both.\nI am ready, I am open to examining this question in the future, taking into account the different legal nature of limitation and prescription, and the fact that the Treaty base proposed excludes harmonisation of internal law, which, in large measure, is what is implied by the report.\nI have to be very frank in pointing out that we will also have to take into account the priorities established in our current work programme, which will also have to be integrated in line with the human resources available in the European Commission.\nThat said, I can see that this very new point put by the rapporteur should be left open for further discussions.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission .
