{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE),", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE), in writing . – Colleagues, I would like to thank my colleague and friend Elmar Brok for his excellent report on CFSP. I should especially like to emphasise three points.\nFirstly, the report expresses the need for a common approach to foreign policy issues in times of globalisation. The report mentions climate change, dependency on energy, failing states and international terrorism, just to mention a few examples.\nSecondly, the report underlines that the Constitutional Treaty provides the necessary institutional innovations, for example the double-hatted foreign minister, to coordinate mutual foreign policy more efficiently.\nThirdly, effective policy needs funds. The report sees ‘the total amount of EUR 1740 billion allocated to the CFSP for the period from 2007 to 2013 as insufficient to achieve the ambitions of the Union as a global actor’. I agree.\nI should therefore like to express my support for this report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE), in writing . – Colleagues, I would like to thank my colleague and friend Elmar Brok for his excellent report on CFSP.
