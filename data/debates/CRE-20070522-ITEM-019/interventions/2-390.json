{"speaker": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner,", "english": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission . Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for this important report. It comes at a very crucial moment, when the German Presidency is trying to revive the Constitutional Treaty, perhaps without its title. The important thing is greater efficiency.\nHow can we achieve greater efficiency in the future? Not only via the institutions but also through the political will of the Member States. Only if there is unanimity in our actual way of voting will there be the possibility of an effective common foreign and security policy. Therefore, we should go forward with more qualified majority voting on common foreign policy. This is very complicated, but I think it would make a real difference.\nI should also like to thank our rapporteur, particularly with regard to his remarks on the delegations. I have started to work very closely with our people on more training, on better political reporting, on public diplomacy and on exchange programmes between the Member States, the Council, the Council Secretariat and ourselves in order to achieve – via osmosis, as I always say – a better understanding of each other and to prepare a cohesive approach in the future.\nLet me just make a couple of further remarks, one about Kosovo. Kosovo is indeed a European problem, which needs a European solution with the agreement of the international community. The European Union is to take responsibility for post-status Kosovo. How can we achieve this? I think this can be done by setting up an international civilian office, by establishing a very significant rule of law mission and by continuing capacity-building on a large scale on the basis of, hopefully, a Security Council resolution.\nI should also like to say that today we have already had quite a long debate on the Middle East. We know how difficult the situation is, but I think the European Union has played quite an important role and wants to continue to play an important role, particularly in conjunction with other members of the Quartet. Even if the situation seems to be rather bleak today, we hope that we can still bring the two sides together for a positive approach in the future.\nI should like to mention that the Black Sea is one of those new areas where we have focused our efforts with regard to our Neighbourhood Policy, because we think this is a new area with new Member States, like Romania and Bulgaria, we have reached out and we would like to work together with Turkey and with Russia on this region, trying to address many of the important issues.\nFinally, with regard to contacts between the Council and the European Parliament, there is now an interinstitutional agreement, there is more contact between the Council and Parliament on CFSP issues, and I think the special representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Matthiessen, who is here today, will certainly also mention that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission .
