{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the interest expressed in the cross-border management of music rights and the 2005 recommendation on online music. The Commission’s 2005 online music recommendation aims to allow the music market in Europe to develop in the digital environment. It aims to create a framework in which the best new online licensing model will emerge by agreement between the market players. This should allow authors, composers and music publishers to get a fair share of the distribution of their online works.\nThe recommendation does not prescribe a particular EU licensing model, and leaves implementation of its principles to the market. Exactly two years after adoption of the recommendation, the Commission is assessing the development of online licensing practices in the music sector in Europe. Stakeholders were invited to comment on emerging online licensing trends by 1 July 2007. The Commission received 88 replies from interested parties, such as collecting societies, authors, creators and music users in Member States. The process of reviewing the submissions is still ongoing. Only after a thorough examination will the Commission assess further policy steps regarding the online operations of collecting societies. The submissions analysed so far show that most stakeholders do not see the need for a framework directive, and prefer market-based solutions to regulatory intervention.\nOn the question of whether the 2005 recommendation is limited to online sales of some recordings, the Commission would like to point out that the principles on transparency and governance set out in the recommendation should not be limited to online music sales and should apply to all the activities of collecting societies.\nTo conclude, while the online market for music is still in flux, legislating in favour of a particular licensing model would appear premature. The Commission will monitor developments and report back to Parliament and the Council as foreseen in the recommendation. Any follow-up, if necessary, will be closely coordinated with the European Parliament and the Council.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the interest expressed in the cross-border management of music rights and the 2005 recommendation on online music.
