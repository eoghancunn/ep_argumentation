{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the Members who spoke for their comments, which I will certainly convey to my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy.\nIf I can pick up on a number of points that have been raised: regarding the need for legislative intervention, let me say that the 2005 Commission recommendation on online music licensing has already brought about significant progress in the marketplace. The recommendation has given collecting societies in Europe an incentive to set up EU-wide licensing platforms that make their repertoire available for online music shops across Europe.\nLet me cite three relevant examples. The UK and German societies have set up a platform for EU-wide licensing of the EMI repertoire, CELAS. The UK and the Spanish societies are cooperating on a platform that will manage the Anglo-Hispanic repertoire at EU level, and the French and Spanish societies have announced a joint licensing platform that grants EU-wide access to the French-Hispanic repertoire. In these circumstances, the Commission does not see the need for any premature legislative intervention.\nI would also like to say that the 2005 Commission recommendation on online licensing has already brought about significant progress in the marketplace. The recommendation has encouraged collecting societies in Europe to set up EU-wide licensing platforms that make their repertoire available for online music shops across Europe. I refer to the three examples I have just mentioned. The CELAS joint venture alone is in fact in a position to license approximately 25 % of all musical works to any European online music retailer, such as iTunes, Sony’s CONNECT or eMusic, in a single transaction.\nOn the question of cultural diversity, let me state that our recommendation is not detrimental to cultural diversity. There are clear indications that the new platforms for Anglo-American, French or Spanish music are open platforms. These platforms can include other music publishers’ repertoires or the entire repertoire of existing societies.\nNational collecting societies would not disappear; authors would still be members of local collecting societies and revenues would still be distributed through collecting societies affiliated to the new licensing platforms.\nRegarding the issue of rights, I would like to underline that there is no reason to think that this multiterritorial licensing model is bad either for cultural diversity or for the rights of artists, while it is good for the rightholders, who get more money than under the old territorial model. Cultural diversity and the rights of artists are also about giving authors more money so that they can continue to create.\nLet me make one last point. The Commission actively encourages the development of an own online licensing market for music. In this vein, the Commission will closely monitor developments in this emerging market and, in doing so, the Commission will carefully consider the issues raised in the Lévai report of 5 March 2007.\nIf, between now and 2010, we observe, for example, that monopolistic licensing structures are emerging on the Internet, that the repertoire available on the Internet does not adequately reflect Europe’s cultural diversity and that the marketplace alone is not delivering EU licensing structures that are adapted to the Internet era, then the Commission will consider adequate alternative means for reaching those objectives.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the Members who spoke for their comments, which I will certainly convey to my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy.\nIf I can pick up on a number of points that have been raised: regarding the need for legislative intervention, let me say that the 2005 Commission recommendation on online music licensing has already brought about significant progress in the marketplace.
