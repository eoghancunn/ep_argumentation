{"speaker": "Ieke van den Burg,", "english": "Ieke van den Burg, on behalf of the PSE Group. – Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur and the other groups for their good cooperation in committee. I hope that the decision to postpone the vote on this report will provide an opportunity to assess which of the amendments tabled improve the report and which have the opposite effect. Perhaps we can find some compromises in the meantime.\nI also agree that this is the right moment for Parliament to have this debate and that this is the right moment for this report, given that a strategic review of the IMF is taking place and the Economic and Financial Committee has produced a paper that will be discussed in the Ecofin Council. For us, too, the role of the IMF in strengthening the stability and solidity of the international financial system is a core issue. However, we should also like to see more focus and attention on social and public policy aspects, and that is why my group retabled some previous amendments.\nOn the constituencies issue and the single seat, both of you have already touched upon how we could strengthen the European voice vis-à-vis other parts of the world. The rapporteur is aware of my own observations on this debate concerning the situation in the Netherlands, in particular, and Belgium, which are in a broader constituency and subject to effects of this kind, but I believe that we could try to find a good formulation on strengthening the European voice and on strengthening the voice of the less-developed countries in the structure in particular.\nThe other amendment we would draw attention to is that concerning transparency and dialogue with NGOs. Here, the IMF could learn from many other international institutions, including our own European Investment Bank, on how to improve dialogue with, and consultation of, NGOs in their work. It might be important to stress this, as well as the issue of the accountability of EU representatives in the IMF. We see a role for the European Parliament in that as a follow-up to this debate, and we hope that we can agree on finding methods and structures, such as the ad hoc working party proposed in our amendments, to create a follow-up on this.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ieke van den Burg, on behalf of the PSE Group. – Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur and the other groups for their good cooperation in committee.
