    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Considers that the IMF as an institution continues to play an important role in promoting balanced global economic growth and exchange rate stability, in facilitating international trade and member countries’ ability to adapt to the global market place and in assisting member countries experiencing balance of payment difficulties;\n",
        "2.   Welcomes the strategic review under way at the IMF; supports a re-orientation of IMF policies towards emphasising its core mandate of stabilising global exchange rate fluctuations and as a lender of last resort for countries experiencing serious balance of payment problems;\n",
        "3.   Notes the profound changes which have taken place in the missions of the IMF since its inception and which have been accompanied by less significant changes in its governance; notes that, in spite of the successive revisions of quotas and of the system for uniform allocation of a package of basic voting rights, the allocation of capital and of voting rights has lagged behind other developments over the years; calls, therefore, on the IMF, in the interest of its own legitimacy, to consider possible means of distributing the quotas and voting rights within its governing institutions in such a way as to make them more representative of the international economic situation and to enable more appropriate weightings to be given to the developing and emerging economies;\n",
        "4.   Points out that the main factors preventing the developing countries from having a voice in the IMF commensurate with the share of the world population they represent are the lack of votes on the Board of Governors (African countries, accounting for 25 % of the membership, have just over 4 % of the vote) and the lack of qualified human resources, technical and institutional capacity to participate in a meaningful way in deliberations and decisions;\n",
        "5.   Calls therefore for a revision of the voting system by increasing the number and the weight of the basic votes (currently representing less than 3 % of votes), which were originally introduced in order to ensure greater equality between members, a better balance in decision making and thus greater legitimacy of the IMF; also calls for the devising of a mechanism which would allow developing countries to increase their membership shares in the Fund, such as the setting up of a Trust Fund to finance member shares for the poorest countries;\n",
        "6.   Notes that the IMF has also extended its recommendations to matters outside the original macroeconomic field, into areas of structural policy, by means of recommendations whose wording impacts directly or indirectly on the conduct of policies on social protection, the right to work, health, the environment and education; notes that this development has clearly raised the issue of the boundaries between the competences of the various UN institutions and those of the World Bank;\n",
        "7.   Considers that, in view of the prerogatives of the IMF, its staffing should come to reflect more varied backgrounds, while ensuring continued excellence, so as to permit the IMF to make a decisive contribution to achieving the MDGs;\n",
        "8.   Notes that, due to the progressive opening-up of capital markets and the liberalisation of movement of capital, it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of financial crises; therefore underlines the need for the IMF to conduct systematic surveillance of all member countries;\n",
        "9.   Considers that the persistence of global imbalances in trade and exchange rates calls for a stepping-up of the IMF’s surveillance role, which is important both in predicting and helping to reduce financial instability globally and in giving advice to individual countries on policies related to financial stability, economic growth, exchange rates and reserve accumulation; considers that the IMF can only conduct systematic surveillance and give advice on desirable actions to prevent the occurrence of financial crises if member countries disclose their complete statistics concerning, for instance, monetary reserves and volume of money in circulation, on a regular basis;\n",
        "10. Considers that the aim of financial stability that forms part of the IMF’s mission is made more difficult by the lack of global and transparent attention paid to the process of standardisation directly affecting the financial markets, to the implementation of that mission on a reciprocal basis or to its interpretation;\n",
        "11. In the interests of parallelism with the WTO, calls on the European institutions responsible, in particular the Council and the Commission, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the eurozone or if possible the European Community is represented and votes as a single block and to facilitate the achievement of that objective as soon as possible as a transitional measure; urges the Member States to join together in an arrangement equivalent to a ‘shareholders agreement’ under company law that will guarantee that they form a single negotiating block;\n",
        "12. Notes the IMF’s role in integrating low-income countries into the world economy and stresses the interdependence of international trade, balance-of-payments problems, national development policies, regulations governing the labour market and public health services aimed at reducing poverty; sees a predominant role for the IMF in facilitating national pro-poor development strategies through lending that allows for greater flexibility in the monetary and foreign exchange policy of low income countries;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission and Council to look with Parliament into the possibility of using the Lamfalussy procedure to define the position taken by the bodies authorised to speak on the Union’s behalf in the various international bodies with responsibility in the financial sector;\n",
        "14. Notes that the IMF’s adjustment policies have sometimes failed to prevent crises from becoming infectious and recurring; regrets in this connection any failed efforts to promote economically-sound policies that prevent crises; recalls that inflation is not the only economic problem in developing countries and that IMF policies should be geared towards the objectives of macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth; suggests that conditionality should also be defined in the context of improved cooperation with the UN’s specialist institutions and coordinated between international donors;\n",
        "15. Notes that to go down the path of sustainable growth the existence of guaranteed macro-economic policies is essential; to that end, affirms that macro-economic stability is not incompatible with the fair distribution of growth;\n",
        "16. Acknowledges that the conditions imposed by the IMF have in some cases been too rigid and not always consistent with specific local circumstances; nevertheless emphasises the need to put loans to good use, whilst considering the position of the recipient country’s democratically-elected institutions;\n",
        "17. Recognises the ongoing review of the conditions attached by the IMF to its loans to low-income countries; recommends that the review makes priority reference to poverty reduction as the goal of all IMF lending to low income countries;\n",
        "18. Stresses that the principle of partner country ownership must be at the centre of development cooperation; therefore calls on the IMF to fully recognise, when considering conditions for lending, the priority to be given to poverty eradication and not to make in any way the achievement of the MDGs more difficult;\n",
        "19. Advocates a gradual, sequential and stable liberalisation of the developing countries’ financial systems, adjusted to take account of their institutional capacities, thus permitting the effective regulation and management of movement of capital;\n",
        "20. Supports the view that the IMF should increase its focus on analysis of financial and capital market developments and the implications for both domestic and global financial stability;\n",
        "21. Strongly believes that developing countries should not have to open up their markets fully and without restrictions to foreign imports and that they should be able to establish protection for certain industries for a limited period so as to permit a steady development; urges European Executive Directors in the Board of the IMF to make sure that remaining conditionalities do not pressure low income countries into unilateral opening of markets outside the frame of WTO negotiations or impede their capacities to negotiate, in the framework of WTO negotiations, of their own volition and on their own terms the degree of market opening to which they are ready to commit; also calls on the IMF to ensure an adequate degree of flexibility in implementing trade-related conditionalities so as to enable beneficiary countries to determine their own degree of market opening;\n",
        "22. Calls on the IMF to continue its efforts to increase transparency and build an institutional structure conducive to its mission and the changing circumstances of international financial policy;\n",
        "23. Emphasises the IMF’s role in aligning European and national development policies aimed at tackling poverty by means of a comprehensive approach based on the idea that trade and monetary policies are not ends in themselves but a tool for tackling poverty;\n",
        "24. Calls on the EU Member States to use the existing constituency system to ensure that the constituencies of which they are members forcefully promote a pro-development agenda based on reaching the MDGs by 2015, and that their constituencies give special attention to the technical and institutional weakness of the developing countries in the constituency and provide the necessary technical assistance to overcome them;\n",
        "25. Calls for better coordination and greater coherence between the policies of the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the European Central Bank, other international organisations and the European Union, in particular as regards the instruments linking the various markets, such as the Integrated Framework, the Trade Integration Mechanism, the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the recently adopted Policy Support Instruments (PSI), in order to ensure that open-market policies have a positive impact on poverty reduction; asks for more coherence between IMF programmes and the MDGs; draws attention in this context to the ambivalence in the position of the IMF which, although it is responsible for only one very specific aspect of public action, plays a leading, if not dominant, role in implementing the strategies pursued by all players; therefore considers that it is essential to create a structure for coordinating and even planning such strategies that involves all international stakeholders;\n",
        "26. Strongly believes that the transparency of the IMF and of the allocation of its funds should be increased through strengthened parliamentary control by the member countries of the IMF;\n",
        "27. Welcomes the IMF’s emphasis on improving the levels of education and health in developing countries; stresses that increasing public expenditure together with improving governance, combating corruption and efficient use of resources, remains the surest way to reduce inequality of access to goods and to fundamental rights such as health and education;\n",
        "28. Insists that international financial stability can only be promoted if the reform of the IMF goes hand in hand with a sustainable budgetary policy and a well-adjusted balance of payments in every member country;\n",
        "29. Notes the striking contrast between the degree of pressure which the IMF can bring to bear on the developing and transitional countries and its powerlessness to exert any significant influence on the policies of the industrialised countries, whose budgetary policy and balance of payments fail in part to fulfil the criteria established by the IMF and may therefore undermine international financial stability;\n",
        "30. Welcomes the decision taken by the IMF and the World Bank to extend the experiment of the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) initiative; notes the diversive effects of the HIPC programmes and the historical experiences of debt restructuring and debt cancellation; suggests that the IMF develop policies to avoid new debt crises in future;\n",
        "31. Notes the new Debt Sustainability Framework of the IMF and the World Bank with regard to Low Income Countries (LICs); welcomes the fact that the new Framework aims to put debt at the centre of the international financial institutions’ decision making process; regrets that the proposal as a whole does not come close to addressing the problem of long-term, real sustainability in terms of creating conditions for low income countries to attain the MDGs;\n",
        "32. Welcomes the IMF’s Poverty and Growth Facility (PRGF) programme in general terms but is concerned that in the PRGF the IMF continues to use the same rigid economic model and fails to recognise different macroeconomic frameworks; fears, therefore, that the much-hailed poverty focus of the PRGF will become largely discredited;\n",
        "33. Supports the call by the UN Secretary-General at the 2005 High Level Dialogue on Finance for Development to redefine debt sustainability as the level of debt that allows a country to achieve the MDGs by 2015 without an increase in debt ratios, which requires greater complementarity between debt relief and outstanding development financing requirements; regrets therefore that in the new Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries approved in April 2005, the IMF continues to define debt sustainability essentially in terms of export ratios (which is an unreliable predictor of debt sustainability for countries characterised by an extreme vulnerability to shock and steep fluctuations in export earnings), that it lacks realistic assessments of vulnerability and that there is no systematic analysis linking the benefits of the HIPC Initiative and the extra funds needed to achieve the MDGs;\n",
        "34. Welcomes the initiatives taken both by the Bretton Woods institutions and by international bodies seeking to find innovative funding mechanisms to promote development and achieve the MDGs, in particular as regards combating poverty; welcomes the efforts made by the multilateral institutions to play their part in funding debt reduction in the context of the agreement concluded by the G8;\n",
        "35. Encourages better cooperation between the IMF and the European Parliament and national parliaments, especially in developing countries, in order to strengthen transparency, democratic responsibility and the legitimacy of the IMF and its policies;\n",
        "36. Stresses the importance of regular contact between IMF Executive Directors and the national representatives of their countries of origin;\n",
        "37. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the IMF, the UN organisations, the ECB and the IMF governors of the EU Member States.EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), created in 1944 under the Bretton Woods agreements, include among the IMF’s objectives the following:\n"
