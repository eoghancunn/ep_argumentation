It is a very thorough interim report. I particularly welcome the request that we delay for three months. It is vital that we do not rush to judgment and that we await the outcome of the inquiries that are being undertaken in the United Kingdom. Of course we must look at the causes of this situation and the crisis that occurred, and particularly at the application of Community law. In that respect I am pleased to be speaking before Commissioner McCreevy. I look forward to what he has to say.\nIt is vital, as I have said, that we do not rush to make a judgement. The witnesses have been extremely forthcoming and cooperative with the Committee of Inquiry. Uppermost in our minds, as the former speaker said, is that we have some recourse to justice, but we must certainly ensure that another Equitable Life crisis never happens again. Those people did what, arguably, we ask all good citizens to do: provide for their retirement, their future. They did so in what should be arguably one of the safest investment pots in any investment industry. It failed to be so, on the evidence that we have before us.\nI commend the report and the work of the temporary committee.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Michael Cashman (PSE). – Mr President, most of what needs to be said has been said already.
