{"speaker": "Robert Atkins,", "english": "Robert Atkins, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I am something of a thorn between two roses: Ms Wallis, who spoke so well today as the rapporteur, and the able and charming Ms McGuinness, the chairman of our committee. That means that I often find myself caught between the two of them, but the work they have done is excellent and what Ms Wallis has spoken about today proves that point.\nWe have had several meetings at which many organisations and individuals have presented evidence that confirms me in my judgement that this special committee was very necessary. We have been much impressed, angered and even moved by those speaking to us and the financial and emotional losses they are experiencing. We have also heard from some of those who are responsible for regulation. So far, I do not think there is any evidence of negligence or criminal activity, but I would characterise their behaviour so far as benign complacency.\nThere are as yet no firm conclusions, but one loophole has been exposed. If a German or an Irishman buys a policy from a British company, it is the British regulator who is responsible for the financial probity of that company. The German or Irish regulators appear to play no role, but that does not help the EU citizen, for whom it is impractical, inconvenient and costly to pursue concerns with the British regulator, even supposing he were interested.\nThe Commission needs to address this. We continue our investigation, but we have no magic wand to restore the fortunes of the aggrieved policyholders. As Ms Wallis said, we must close the loopholes, learn from what has gone before and improve the position next time, especially as it relates to the activities of the Commission.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Atkins, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I am something of a thorn between two roses: Ms Wallis, who spoke so well today as the rapporteur, and the able and charming Ms McGuinness, the chairman of our committee.
