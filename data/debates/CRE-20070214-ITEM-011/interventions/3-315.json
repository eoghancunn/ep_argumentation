{"speaker": "Günter Gloser,", "english": "Günter Gloser, President-in-Office of the Council . (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks for this stimulating debate. The positive data reported in various fields are of course welcome, yet we must not rest on our laurels on this account – further action is needed.\nVarious arguments have also been put forward as to the EU’s position on, for example, the issue of employment and economic policies – focusing on the Lisbon process. It was also important to mention that competition and jobs were joined by sustainability in Gothenburg. The Spring European Council due to be held in a few days’ time will address an issue that intersects with the field of jobs – namely that of energy.\nThis issue involves, on the one hand, energy as a product and, on the other hand, the question of how to deal with energy in future. Can alternative forms be found? How can new fields be developed in this regard? After all, this is not something dreamed up by one party or another; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element.\nI should like to state on behalf of the Presidency that what is equally important – and Franz Müntefering, the President of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, held a meeting on this issue just last week, in Nuremburg in Bavaria – is how Europe can continue to incorporate the social dimension. What challenges are to be met? How can we show that Europe does not represent a threat, but rather an answer to the challenge of globalisation and the issue of maintaining the social security system?\nThese are very important points, which we shall also pursue within the framework of the G8. I have already given my assurances that, in terms of not only the dialogue, the Troika, but also of the issue as to how Commission, Council and Parliament deal with each other in order to stay in close contact on this, we are pursuing the same objectives.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Günter Gloser, President-in-Office of the Council .
