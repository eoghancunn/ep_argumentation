{"speaker": "Michael Henry Nattrass,", "english": "Michael Henry Nattrass, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bullmann report shows that economies of countries which have not yet adopted the euro are performing better than those who have. Indeed, I must congratulate Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. They have not only shaken off the shackles of Communism but also embraced the free market, low taxation and minimal regulation. Is it any wonder they have the highest growth rates in Europe?\nHowever, I must warn them that this has ended. It will all be downhill from here. Latvia will adopt the euro in 2008, Lithuania and Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2010 and they will be hamstrung by EU regulation, EU targets and by the EU continually meddling in their economic affairs.\nI think we should all worry when the report informs us that the European Union must play a more active role in determining economic policy. One size does not fit all and individual countries know best how to find their markets, manage their economies and trade with the world. Please give them economic independence.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Michael Henry Nattrass, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bullmann report shows that economies of countries which have not yet adopted the euro are performing better than those who have.
