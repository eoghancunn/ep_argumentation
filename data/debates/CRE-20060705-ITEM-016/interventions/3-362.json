Decent people do not want any part of that, and I deplore what has happened in regard to some recent incidents.\nI have three points to make in this debate. First, the control of immigration policy is, I believe, properly a national issue and should not become an EU competence; otherwise, national governments cannot exercise the controls necessary to their situation. Second, it is imperative that immigrants integrate and do not become a debilitating state within a state. Hence, in the United Kingdom I support Chancellor Gordon Brown’s calls for a willingness and for procedures to embrace Britishness. My third and final point is that with three million illegal immigrants in the EU, this issue has to be robustly tackled, not least because of its association with the odious practice of human trafficking.
