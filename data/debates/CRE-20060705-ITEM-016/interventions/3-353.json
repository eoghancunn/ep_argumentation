The Verts/ALE Group fully supports its main ideas. The proposal to call on Member States to encourage political participation by immigrants is particularly important.\nWe believe that long-term resident immigrants should have the right to vote in local and municipal elections. It is regrettable that not all political groups fully support such measures, without which, in our opinion, immigrants will remain politically and socially isolated. The Commission should therefore undertake a legal review of Member States’ current practices in this area.\nWe shall all have the opportunity to see how the local elections are conducted in our host city, Brussels. All non-EU citizens who have lived there without interruption for five years will have the right to participate. I hope that event will be an example of good practice, to be adopted by all Member States in their election laws.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Tatjana Ždanoka (Verts/ALE). – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Lambrinidis on his excellent report.
