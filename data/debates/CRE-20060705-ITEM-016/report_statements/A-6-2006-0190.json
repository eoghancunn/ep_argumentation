    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Urges the Commission to ensure the effective implementation of the existing Directives linked to integration, notably Council Directives 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification[2], 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents[3], 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin[4]and 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation; whereas many Member States lag behind in effectively implementing these Directives, and it is critical for the Commission to monitor more rigorously both the transposition of integration-related Directives and the effectiveness of administrative practices that implement the relevant legislation in the day-to-day lives of immigrants;\n",
        "2.  Welcomes the Commission proposal to establish the European Fund for Integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007-2013 and urges that use of this fund follow six concrete principles, namely: (a)  a single annual focal point should define disbursements, allowing the Commission to develop a critical mass of expertise and more rigorously to assess, evaluate, and invest in programmes; target investment areas should include reducing the employment gap between immigrantsand others,improving immigrant participation and performance in education, advancing the education and employment prospects of women, language and introductory programs, health, housing and urban living and enhancing political and civic participation of immigrants; (b) the fund should favour initiatives with the greatest potential to be broadly applied throughout the Union; (c) the Commission should dedicate a reasonable and defined percentage of the fund’s resources each year to underwriting evaluations by independent experts of the effectiveness of the programs financed by the Commission; (d) once these experts have identified promising programmes, immediate priority should be given to disseminating and adapting best practices from these programmes for use in other Member States; (e) supporting efforts among Member States to coordinate their integration efforts and exchange best practices should be supported; (f) a focus on the integration of newcomers, ensuring nevertheless that  programs that target second and third generation immigrant descendants also receive funding; programsaiming to help refugees as they prepare to enter and integrate into EU societies should also be considered;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the reference in the above mentioned Commission communication to the Common Basic Principles (CBPs); is of the firm belief that the CBPs represent a sound set of recommendations which should be the foundation of EU integration policy; regrets that Member States have failed to follow up the CBPs in any meaningful way since their adoption in 2004; calls on the incoming Finnish Presidency to put the CBPs back at the heart of the agenda, especially those principles relating to employment (no. 3), interaction (no. 7) and participation (no. 9);\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the Commission's proposal to promote an annual Integration Forum to facilitate the exchange of best practice, especially in policies where the EU has a limited role to play but where some Member States operate policies which could offer guidance to others; considers that this Forum should seek the participation of representatives from all the authorities involved in integration, being local, regional, national, or EU authorities, as well as of immigrants themselves;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the Commission to clarify, expand and coordinate responsibilities for integration across DGs, including reviving and maintaining a cross-DG working group on integration and defining the precise integration responsibilities among different DGs; further calls for action to be taken to make the new Integration Fund and the European Social Fund complementary;\n",
        "6.  Welcomes the Commission’s recognition of the need for research into and a mapping exercise of Member States’ integration policies and levels of participation of immigrants; considers that this information is a pre-requisite for any EU policy aimed at fostering better integration in the EU and that for such a mapping exercise to be of use, the terms of the EU debate on integration need to be clarified, given that the word 'integration' itself is open to many different interpretations;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Commission to create a permanent contact group of immigrant representatives, experts, NGOs and others to advise it on all policies related to integration;\n",
        "8.   Calls on the Commission to place special emphasis on promoting immigration and diversity in the EU and on mainstreaming integration at all times through its communication strategy and initiatives; calls on the Commission and Member States to launch information and awareness-raising campaigns to improve understanding of migration and of the economic and social contribution immigrants make to society;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission to establish rigorous monitoring mechanisms for the evaluation of integration programmes in the Member States, including through the use of independent experts, and to launch a rigorous and practical report on migration and integration; as such, urges the Commission to recast the Report as a biannual report that:\n",
        "10. Encourages the Commission to consult, as appropriate, migrant communities in defining and implementing European aid and development policies in their home countries;\n",
        "11. Asks the Commission to multiply research and analysis initiatives aimed at understanding what works in integration and to ambitiously expand effective efforts to disseminate best practices in cooperation with Member States and local authorities, not only through the proposed website but by as many other reasonable means as possible;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission and Member States to utilise the broad potential of Commission delegations and consular authorities throughout the world to assist in integrating potential immigrants through familiarising them with EU and Member State culture, history, language and civic rights and responsibilities;\n",
        "13. Stresses the importance of the composition of the European institutions' staff and the Member States' public administrations reflecting the composition of the Union’s and the Member States' populations;\n",
        "14. Urges the Council to use the 'passerelle' clause of Article 67(2), second indent of the Treaty to give Parliament co-decision powers on integration and legal migration and qualified majority voting in the Council; considers that it is important for Members to have the power of co-decision on integration policy, given that they represent the political voice of the EU, and that therefore they should represent the opinions of both immigrants and citizens and should share responsibility for making integration policy in the EU legislative process;\n",
        "15. Urges the Council to make permanent the annual meeting of integration ministers, inaugurated by the Dutch EU Presidency at Groningen in November 2004;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Member States, when making their final considerations on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, seriously to consider a role for such agency in promoting trust and good relations within neighbourhoods and to develop this role organically through the successive annual programmes foreseen for the agency;\n",
        "17. Urges the Council to reconsider the Commission proposal to apply the open method of coordination to integration policy; in this respect, calls for the involvement of Parliament in the whole procedure;\n",
        "18. Urges the Council to establish a comprehensive and forward-looking framework directive on legal migration, with due regard to the need for integration;\n",
        "19. Encourages Member States to assign responsibility to a single cabinet minister to monitorimmigrant integration policies, to ensure that policies are mainstreamed throughout agencies at all levels of government and to consider the appointment of a High Commissioner on Integration or an Integration Ombudsman in each Member State to coordinate implementation of policies, disseminate information to migrants, review migrant complaints and take action to correct problems;\n",
        "20. Calls on every Member State to provide an audit of all government agencies at every level that have or should have responsibilities related to immigrant integration;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to examine the possibility of incorporating the issue of integration of third-country nationals in the future multiannual programmes of the Fundamental Rights Agency;\n",
        "22. Calls on Member States to encourage the political participation of immigrants and discourage their political and social isolation; in this regard, calls on the Commission to carry out a legal review of existing provisions relating to EU civic citizenship in the various Member States as well as of current Member State practices regarding the right of long-term resident immigrants to vote in local and municipal elections;\n",
        "23. Calls on Member States to establish transparent, humane, fast and reasonable procedures for the granting of long-term resident status, for family reunificationand for the naturalization of long-term resident immigrants and their children, taking into account especially the fact that many of those children are born in the territory of a Member State;\n",
        "24. Draws the Member States' attention to the dependent legal status of immigrant women joining their spouses under family reunification and calls on Member States to review their legislation so as to ensure that spouses and children be granted an individual status and work permit independent of that of the principal legal status holder at the earliest opportunity in order to guarantee and protect their rights fully and facilitate their social integration;\n",
        "25. Encourages political parties, trade unions and civil society as a whole at national level to include immigrants as full members at all levels of their respective structures;\n",
        "26. Is in favour of integration programmes applied by certain Member States involving a mutual commitment by the host country and immigrants; hopes that immigrants can in this way be made more aware of the European Union's fundamental values and be enabled at the same time to acquire basic knowledge on the functioning of the host society; stresses the importance of encouraging the learning of the host society's language and organising civic education courses;\n",
        "27. Encourages Member States to strengthen anti-discrimination and anti-racism laws and to enforce existing ones, as well as to consider appropriate affirmative action legislation for migrants in all appropriate fields, using those Member States where affirmative action has been a success as a guide;\n",
        "28. Calls on Member States, in order especially to prevent the potential maltreatment of immigrant women, to provide them with easily accessible information as regards the legislation of the host country on gender equality and the rights and protection that derive from that legislation, including the available legal and administrative remedies;\n",
        "29. Calls on Member States and regional and local authorities to stimulate interaction between immigrants and their host society by promoting,inter alia, shared fora, intercultural   dialogue, seminars, exhibitions and cultural and sports activities; further calls for the creation of new, or the support of existing, structures to allow immigrants to integrate in the host society in order to avoid the social exclusion of newcomers and of those who have already settled but who find it difficult to integrate while also supporting migrant organizations in their territories and the strengthening of ties with the migrants' home countries;\n",
        "30. Encourages Member States to make provision for integration-related measures for refugees during the reception phase, such as  language courses or voluntary work activities, taking into consideration the fact that the integration process for refugees starts during the reception phase;\n",
        "31. Stresses the importance of developing a comprehensive framework for European Civil Citizenship with the cooperation of Parliament, Council and Commission;\n",
        "32. Stresses the importance of establishing annual hearings on integration with the participation of Parliament, national parliaments and civil society, especially NGOs and immigrant associations, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Union’s integration efforts and assess developments regarding immigrant integration at Member State level;\n",
