    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Acknowledges the urgent need for action to be taken by the Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers to ensure a profitable and sustainable future for sheepmeat and goatmeat production in the EU, to encourage the consumption of such products once more, and to retain and attract young sheep and goat farmers to the sector, and advocates the maintenance of these traditional, eco-friendly farming enterprises with their role in supplying the Community market and in providing a Community supply base of EU sheep and goat farming products;\n",
        "2.  Notes the Commission’s intention to review policy instruments since it has been demonstrated that there has been a negative impact; welcomes the further reference to this specific issue in the context of the recently published European Commission communication – Preparing for the ‘Health Check’ of the CAP reform (COM(2007)0722);\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers to direct additional financial support as a matter of urgency to EU sheep and goat producers in order to develop a vibrant, self-sufficient, market-led and consumer-orientated sheep and goat sector in the EU; calls on the Commission and Council of Agriculture Ministers to examine the future of these sectors as part of the CAP ‘Health Check’ through the implementation of a variety of measures, giving each Member State the flexibility of choosing from the following possible options, while not overlooking the need to avoid distortion of competition on the internal market: ·Introduction of a new Environmental Sheep Maintenance Scheme per ewe to be either a) financed directly by EU funding or b) co-financed by EU and National Governments to arrest the decline in production, linked to the positive environmental attributes associated with the maintenance of sheep production as well as achieving improvements in technical and quality areas of production, ·Analysis of the availability and utilisation of unused funds under Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy, with a view to redirecting that support to the sheep and goat sectors, ·Amendment of Article 69 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 in the framework of the CAP ‘Health Check’ so the Member States can allocate up to 12 % of their national payments to measures to support sectors in difficulty and to maintain agriculture in less favoured areas, ·Inclusion of measures in support of sheep and goat producers among the new challenges arising from the CAP ‘Health Check’ under the second pillar, with the possibility of using Modulation support funds;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Commission to introduce an additional payment for rare traditional and regional breeds of sheep and goat in order to maintain biodiversity in agriculture and to preserve sheep in sensitive areas;\n",
        "5.  As part of the simplification process in the review of the CAP ‘Health Check’, calls on the  Commission to allow 14 days’ notice to livestock farmers for on-farm cross-compliance inspections;\n",
        "6.  Notes that the return to the producer for sheepmeat products as a percentage of the retail price is insufficient and draws attention to its Written Declaration on investigating and remedying abuse of power by large supermarkets operating in the European Union[2]; welcomes the fact that the Commission has established a High Level Group on the Competitiveness of the Agro-Food Industry which will examine the situation regarding market power in distribution, and counts on representatives from Parliament being fully involved in its work;\n",
        "7.  Notes that the return to the producer for sheepmeat products as a percentage of the retail price is insufficient and calls on the Commission to investigate the sheepmeat and goatmeat supply chain to ensure that farmers receive a fair return from the marketplace;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission to foster a climate of direct sales by producers and producer organisations in order to limit artificial increases in price;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission and Council of Agriculture Ministers to review the introduction of an electronic identification system for sheep intended for 31 December 2009, due to the difficulty in its implementation, high costs and unproven benefits; asks that each Member State be allowed the discretion of introducing this system on a voluntary basis;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to improve its ability to respond to animal diseases as serious as the current outbreak of bluetongue by means of a new EU animal health strategy, research funding, compensation for losses, advances on payments, etc.;\n",
        "11. Calls on the EU negotiating team at the World Trade Organization talks to reduce the scale of the proposed tariff cuts on sheepmeat and to ensure that the option of sensitive product status for sheepmeat products is available to the EU;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission to reassess existing import quota management regimes to ensure that EU-produced lamb is not exposed to unfair competition;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission to introduce a mandatory EU labelling regulation system for sheepmeat products, which would have an EU‑wide logo to allow consumers to distinguish between EU products and those from third countries, which would be underwritten by a number of criteria including a farm assurance scheme and a country of origin indication, ensuring that consumers are fully aware as to the place of origin of the product; considers that the system must be designed in such a way as to avoid undermining existing promotional labelling schemes at Member State and regional level;\n",
        "14. Underlines that the most effective and sustainable means of helping the sector lie in developing the market, communicating with consumers, highlighting the nutritional and health benefits of the products concerned and boosting consumption;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission to increase the current annual EU Food Promotion Budget, which is valued at EUR 45 million for 2008, to ring fence funding for EU sheepmeat and to change, simplify and streamline the practical rules governing the operation of the budget so that lamb products can be given meaningful access to the budget;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission and Member States to give a higher profile to the essential role played by sheep farming in terms of contributing to the economy and the sustainability of areas that face the most difficulties and in terms of managing the countryside, and as a priority to make it easier for young farmers to start up in that sector;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to co-ordinate promotional campaigns for PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) and PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) sheepmeat and goatmeat products, and to target the Member States concerned in order to maximise consumption;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission to undertake, in general terms and at Community level, a communication campaign targeted at consumers as a whole and backed up by innovative actions (from making different consumer preparations available at the various sales outlets to campaigns spearheaded by celebrated European chefs), stressing the quality of the product and disseminating awareness of its culinary potential;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission and Member States to initiate programmes to encourage producers to set up producer and marketing groups, engage in direct marketing and produce and prove their production of special qualities of sheepmeat and goatmeat products and sheep and goat milk products (for example organic products or regional specialities);\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to provide assistance in opening export markets for EU sheepmeat and offals in countries where unnecessary restrictions currently apply;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to include the sheep and goat sector in the ‘second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008-13)’[3]in order to promote the health and protein benefits of sheepmeat and goatmeat to consumers, particularly to young people who are low consumers of sheep and goat products, and to conduct an active information campaign in the Member States on sheepmeat and goatmeat and their derived products;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission to support research and development in the ‘small ruminant’ industry, concentrating on both technical innovation for farms and product innovation with regard to lamb, cheese and by-products such as wool and pelts, known as the ‘fifth quarter’, where the financial return is almost negligible at present;\n",
        "23. Stresses the need to improve the availability of medicinal and veterinary products for the sheep and goat sectors at a European level through support for pharmaceutical research and the simplification of marketing authorisations;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission, inter alia bearing in mind bluetongue, to accelerate the pace of research into causes and methods of control when an outbreak of an animal disease occurs, formulate an efficient control strategy, coordinate the measures taken by Member States, promote the development of vaccines, develop an efficient vaccination strategy and provide financial support for the vaccination of livestock; calls for measures which are required by law in order to control an animal disease, but which over time have proven to be inefficient, to be deleted from the catalogue of measures as quickly as possible;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission to bring forward proposals on price transparency in the sector in order to provide information to consumers and producers on product prices;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission and the Presidency of the Council to set up an implementation task force to oversee the practical reform of the sheep and goat sectors in the EU and to ensure that this implementation task force reports to the European Parliament’s Agriculture Committee and the Council of Agriculture Ministers every six months, for the next two years, on the policy changes that it is enacting; notes that this implementation task force should be comprised of key officials from the European Commission and from the countries representing the four forthcoming Presidencies of the EU;\n",
        "27. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
