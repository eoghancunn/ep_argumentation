{"speaker": "Liam Aylward,", "english": "Liam Aylward, Rapporteur . − (GA) Mr President, the sheep and goat sectors are very important for the economy and environment in Europe. Sheep and goat farming is even more important in remote areas and in mountainous regions, where it is often depended on from an economic and agricultural perspective. It does not adversely impact the environment and it protects the rural landscape.\nBut yet, the future of this industry is currently under pressure in the European Union. Sheep production has fallen 12.5% since 2000. Farmers are leaving this occupation as the work is hard and income is too low. Sheepmeat consumption is in decline, as some feel it is too expensive and difficult to cook. This is particularly true among younger people. There is also increased competition in the market from other countries.\nSheepmeat production will fall 10% by the year 2015 unless something is done now. This sector should be looked at under the CAP ‘Health Check’, and prompt action should be taken.\nMr President, since being appointed rapporteur for this report in June 2007, I have opened up a wide-ranging series of discussions with interested parties, including farming organisations, representatives from the lamb-processing sector and consumer organisations. Ernst and Young compiled a very thorough study of the sheep and goat sectors, for which I would like to thank them. I consulted with the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel, and various European agriculture ministers, who were all very supportive to me in compiling this report. At all times I try to remain realistic in the proposals I put forward.\nVery briefly I would highlight the main recommendations of the report.\nFirstly, the introduction of a new environmental sheep-maintenance scheme which would allow sheep farmers to be paid under on a per-ewe basis, in recognition of the positive environmental attributes associated with the maintenance of sheep production, to be co-financed by national and European Union funding.\nSecondly, an additional payment for traditional mountain breeds in order to preserve sheep in sensitive areas.\nThirdly, an EU regulation for the labelling of sheepmeat products which would have an EU-wide logo to allow consumers to distinguish between EU products and those from third countries; this would be underwritten by a number of criteria, including farm assurance schemes and a country of origin indication, thus ensuring that consumers are fully aware of the point of origin of the product.\nFourthly, a review of the introduction of the compulsory electronic identification system for sheep, scheduled for 31 December 2009. Due to the difficulty in implementation, high cost and unproven benefits, we propose allowing each Member State the discretion to decide whether to introduce electronic tagging on a voluntary basis if they so wish.\nFifthly, an increase in the current annual European Commission food promotion budget which is valued at EUR 45 million for 2008, the ring-fencing of funding for EU lamb, and changes and simplifications to the practical rules governing the operation of this budget so that lamb products can be given meaningful access to this budget.\nSixthly, that the European Commission bring forward proposals on price transparency in this sector to provide information to consumers and producers.\nSeventhly, a review of existing import quota management regimes by the European Commission so as to ensure that EU-produced lamb is not exposed to unfair competition and that the option of sensitive produce status for sheep meat products be available to the European Union.\nEighthly, support for the European Commission in research and development in the small ruminant industry, concentrating on both technical innovation for farms and product innovation.\nNinthly, as part of the simplification process in the review of the common agricultural policy health check, which is taking place over the next eight months, the European Commission must allow 14 days’ notice to be given to livestock farmers for on-farm cross-compliance inspections.\nFinally, the setting-up of an EU implementation task force comprising members of the European Commission, the presidency and the Council. This EU implementation task force will oversee the practical reforms needed so as to make the European sheep sector viable, competitive and profitable.\nI would ask my colleagues to support this report as I believe, if implemented, it will go a long way to help save the sheep and goat sectors in the European Union.", "lang": "GA", "original": "Liam Aylward, Rapporteur . − (GA) Mr President, the sheep and goat sectors are very important for the economy and environment in Europe.
