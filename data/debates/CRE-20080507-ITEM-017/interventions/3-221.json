We are particularly pleased that all our main points have been incorporated. We emphasise that future industrial growth in the European Union is dependent on our openness to foreign trade and investment governed by fair rules, but that our competitiveness with the ASEAN countries is up to us, by improving our own levels of education, training, research, enterprise and innovation.\nWe see scientific and technical cooperation and the protection of intellectual property rights as essential elements of a successful relationship. We expect, in particular, cooperation in combating counterfeiting. We look for improvement in rules of origin; in the harmonisation of standards, of product safety, child protection and animal welfare; in their bureaucratic procedures; in transparency of state aids and non-tariff barriers, and the elimination of discriminatory taxes.\nWe expect to see covered the avoidance of environmental damage from deforestation and palm oil extraction and, while recognising the need to keep anti-dumping mechanisms at our disposal, we would much prefer avoiding the need for them by pre-emptive intervention and negotiation.\nWe look for concerted actions with ASEAN on the energy front and for the Commission to promote joint research projects with establishments in that region.\nIn this spirit, we look forward to a mutually beneficial and successful trade and economic relationship with the ASEAN countries.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Purvis, Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . − Mr President, Mr Ford’s report as a whole is what my committee would have wanted to see.
