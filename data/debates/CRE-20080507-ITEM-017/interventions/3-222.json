{"speaker": "Peter Šťastný,", "english": "Peter Šťastný, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, let me begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Ford, rapporteur of this report. The proposed trade agreement with ASEAN forms part of a wider strategy of bilateral and interregional negotiations with EU trading partners.\nIf considered as a single entity, ASEAN would be the EU’s fifth-largest trading partner, ahead of Japan. ASEAN is an extremely diverse region with three of its members being LDCs, while others have a higher income per head than many EU Member States. I and my colleagues in INTA strongly support the Commission’s first option: to negotiate with the region as a whole, to strengthen regional economic integration between the ASEAN countries.\nThe report stresses the importance of interregional trade agreements, which can usually supplement the multicultural system – provided they are wide-ranging and ambitious, going well beyond tariff reductions – and implement social and environmental standards. The report urges the parties to progressively reduce or dismantle all barriers to trade in goods and services, while fully respecting the differing economic positions within the ASEAN region. It also urges the Commission to ensure transparency and effective rules for public procurement – IPRs, state aid and other subsidies.\nIn conclusion, let me also thank the rapporteur for his positive collaboration, reflected in some compromise amendments which put the report’s main emphasis on trade and trade related issues, alongside topics of human rights and sustainable development. Adoption of these and other amendments made the report more balanced.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Šťastný, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, let me begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Ford, rapporteur of this report.
