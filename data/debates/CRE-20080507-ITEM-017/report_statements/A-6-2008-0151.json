    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Believes that an ambitious agreement will greatly benefit both sides and, even though a high quality agreement is more important than a rapid timetable, is nonetheless concerned about the slow pace of negotiations; emphasises the importance of achieving concrete results for EU businesses by improving market access;\n",
        "2.  Considers that a successful DDA remains the Union's trade priority and wishes negotiations with ASEAN to be complementary to it; considers that the proposed FTA has to fully respect WTO rules;\n",
        "3.  Believes that inter-regional agreements can usefully supplement the multilateral system, provided they are wide-ranging and ambitious, going well beyond tariff reductions in order to open markets, together with the implementation of technical, social and environmental standards;\n",
        "4.  Emphasises that future industrial growth in the Union is dependent upon openness to foreign trade and investment, governed by fair rules;\n",
        "5.  Regrets that, at the EU-ASEAN Summit held in Singapore in November 2007, certain provisions relating to business practices and conduct were not treated in depth, thus inhibiting EU investment in ASEAN countries;\n",
        "6.  Stresses the importance of strengthening regional economic integration between the ASEAN countries; calls on the Commission to provide technical assistance and further possible support to facilitate such a reinforcement;\n",
        "7.  Believes that, if certain countries in ASEAN prove to be reticent about signing an FTA, then those countries that wish to participate should be offered the choice of signing bilateral FTAs;\n",
        "8.  Urges the parties to progressively reduce or dismantle all barriers to trade in goods and services, while fully respecting the differing economic positions within the ASEAN region;\n",
        "9.  Urges the Commission, in the EU-ASEAN framework agreement, to ensure transparency and effective rules for public procurement, competition and investment, IPRs, state aid and other subsidies; stresses the importance of services in EU-ASEAN trade relations;\n",
        "10. Stresses that a trade and investment agreement with ASEAN should ensure: (i)     the improvement and simplification of rules of origin, (ii)     the harmonisation of standards, including product safety, child protection and animal welfare standards, (iii)    regulatory transparency and simplified bureaucratic procedures, (iv)    the elimination of discriminatory taxes;\n",
        "11. Regards non-tariff barriers as of no less importance than tariff reductions and is particularly concerned about restrictions on business services, where a reduction in unjustified constraints could lead to ASEAN firms having access to lower cost, more efficient banking, insurance and legal services;\n",
        "12. Stresses the importance of IPRs and calls for their effective enforcement to be given priority, particularly for design, sound recordings and other cultural goods as well as geographical indications and appellations of origin; asks the Commission to tackle barriers notwithstanding the right of countries to regulate sectors - such as audiovisual - that play a key role in preserving cultural diversity;\n",
        "13. Attaches particular importance to the fight against counterfeit pharmaceuticals which represent unfair competition and a danger to consumers; at the same time, points out that nothing in the agreement should create legal or practical obstacles to the maximum use of flexibilities set out in the declaration on the TRIPS agreement and access to medicines and calls on the Commission negotiators to take full account of the points set out in its above mentioned resolution of 12 July 2007 on this topic;\n",
        "14. Believes that aspects of the agreement affecting public procurement should recognise the varying level of development of ASEAN members and respect the right of all participants to regulate public services, particularly those relating to basic needs;\n",
        "15. Considers that the agreement should seek to promote increased transparency and accountability with regard to investments made by sovereign wealth funds;\n",
        "16. Considers it necessary to focus in detail on the fishing industry, and in particular on the tuna sector, given the strong socio-economic impact that the full and immediate liberalisation of tariffs would have on this sensitive sector, as recognised by the Commission in its study on the sector drawn up at Parliament's request;\n",
        "17. Stresses the importance of compliance with hygiene and health rules in the fishing industry as a means of achieving improved and increased development of the industry in these countries, as well as fair competition with the EU fishing industry;\n",
        "18. Urges that inter-regional economic cooperation be extended to the field of macro-economics, including cooperation in matters of taxation and statistics, the adoption of international auditing and accounting standards and measures to combat corruption and money laundering;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Union and ASEAN to enhance cooperation in combating human trafficking, sex-tourism and counterfeiting; welcomes ASEAN members’ commitments against drugs while calling on them to uphold the UN death penalty moratorium; commends the Philippines for abolishing the death penalty;\n",

        "21. Believes that the competitiveness of the Union with ASEAN countries is dependent upon improved education, training and research in the Union and the creation of innovative products and services;\n",
        "22. Believes that trade, investment and scientific and research agreements should address sector-specific issues, such as: (i)     low energy light bulbs, (ii)     the prevention of and recovery following natural disasters; (iii)    the tourism sector, with special reference to small and medium sized enterprises, (iv)    the free movement of researchers, business people and tourists, (v)    cooperation between research centres in the Union and in ASEAN countries andthe exchange of scientific research findings, (vi)    aerosol dispensers;\n",
        "23. Recommends that the Union's energy policy, with respect to ASEAN countries, concentrates on: (i)     non-discriminatory licensing and trade conditions relating to energy products, (ii)     improvements in energy production and export capacity, (iii)    the development of transport infrastructure for energy products, (iv)    the diversification of energy sources, (v)    the elimination of border taxes on energy products, (vi)    mutual agreements on energy saving, mitigating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including potential reciprocal emissions trading arrangements, so as to avoid damage to industries in the Union;\n",
        "24. Would welcome the development of joint research projects conducted by research establishments in the Union and in ASEAN countries and urges the Commission to take steps to facilitate such arrangements;\n",
        "25. Recalls the need to protect industry in the Union against dumping by ASEAN exporters and to pre-empt such dumping by early intervention on the part of the Union's trade negotiators;\n",
        "26. Underlines that any schedule of tariff reductions should take full account of the differing economic positions of ASEAN members;\n",
        "27. Considers that poorer non-LDC members of ASEAN should benefit from flexibilities that are broadly equivalent to those offered by the Economic Partnership Agreements to countries with comparable income levels;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission, at an appropriate point during the negotiations, to invite Cambodia and Laos to indicate whether they would wish to be included in the agreement and, were the reply to be positive, to seek a revised negotiating mandate from the Council that would make this possible;\n",
        "29. Believes that the current situation in Burma makes it impossible for that country to be included in the agreement;\n",
        "30. Considers a resolution to the problem of banking secrecy in Singapore, which is blocking the conclusion of a PCA, to be essential if there is to be a real prospect of a region-to-region FTA;\n",
        "31. Considers an ambitious sustainable development chapter to be an essential part of any agreement and emphasises that the enforcement of those agreed standards is essential;\n",
        "32. Calls for any agreement to incorporate binding social and environmental clauses, committing the parties to ratifying the core International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions and ensuring their effective implementation, particularly as regards child and forced labour, the eradication of which is a crucial challenge for the ILO, as it pointed out in its report entitled 'End of Child Labour: Within Reach';\n",
        "33. Invites the Commission to consider ways of providing incentives to countries that improve labour standards, so as to ensure that the spread of FTAs does not undermine the attractiveness of qualifying for GSP+ status, whilst also studying the possibility of introducing a clause involving ratification of the basic United Nations and ILO conventions on human and labour rights, particularly those relating to child and forced labour;\n",
        "34. Stresses that, once the EU-ASEAN FTA is in force, measures should be adopted to avoid undermining the advantages enjoyed by the LDCs regarding access for their products to the Union;\n",
        "35. Believes that a Trade and Sustainable Development Forum, made up of workers' and employers' organisations and civil society representatives, could play a valuable role in ensuring that greater market opening is accompanied by rising environmental and social standards;\n",
        "36. Proposes that a mechanism be established whereby recognised workers’ and employers’ organisations should be able to submit requests for action, which would be treated within a specified time period, and which could result in ongoing follow-up and review provisions, in order to maintain pressure against violations of workers' rights;\n",
        "37. Looks forward to the early publication of a Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) which must be available in time to allow full public consultation so that its results can influence the outcome of the negotiations, particularly with regard to measures which may be required to mitigate the negative impact on certain groups or sectors;\n",

        "40. Regards measures to combat deforestation and to protect and enhance tropical forests to be of great importance in the fight against climate change as well as contributing to the preservation of biological diversity; considers therefore that a PCA should only encourage trade in environmentally sustainable biofuels and that ASEAN countries should be assisted in their efforts to tackle illegal logging;\n",
        "41. Calls on the negotiating partners to make sure that an agreement includes mechanisms to safeguard the traditional and customary rights of indigenous and local communities to use their forests when implementing forest management and licensing schemes, and to enhance the capacity of national parliaments and civil society, including local communities and indigenous people, to participate in decision-making regarding the conservation, use and management of natural resources, and to demarcate and defend their land rights;\n",
        "42.

        "44. Notes that measures to step up economic and trade relations between the Union and ASEAN will help to consolidate overall relations between the two regions and encourage further progress regarding political cooperation and security, the advancement of democracy and human rights, further progress in the field of energy/climate change and the environment, in the socio-cultural field and in the area of cooperation and development;\n",
        "45. Welcomes progress on ASEAN integration and the signing of the ASEAN Charter in the hope that its provisions will enter into force as soon as possible;\n",
