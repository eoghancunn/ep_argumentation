    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Is convinced that the European Union must play a major role to make migration a lever of development;\n",
        "2.  Stresses that the Union should give a comprehensive political response (regional in nature and focusing in particular on Africa and South-South migration) to the issue of the link between development and migration; calls for the migration issue to be placed at the top of the agenda and the political dialogue between Europe and the various regions with which it has relations, and supports the organisation of a Europe-Africa Summit to identify a common political response;\n",
        "3.  Considers that European migration and development policy should be based above all on the principles of solidarity with third countries and co-development in order to tackle the underlying causes of migration and, in particular, eradicate poverty;\n",
        "4.  Reiterates its support for the idea of mobility of human beings as a human right, which therefore cannot be understood in terms of commercial logic; emphasises that any policy in this area must be committed to promoting mobility by choice rather than by necessity;\n",
        "5.  Points out that the only adequate EU response to the phenomenon of immigration is a Common Strategy which clearly sets out the objectives and the mechanisms available to the Member States for the purpose of addressing the phenomenon jointly and on the basis of mutual support;\n",
        "6.  Encourages the integration of the migration issue into EU external policies, following the example of the Barcelona Process;\n",
        "7.  Commends the Council proposal to hold a EuroMed Ministerial meeting on migration in 2006; also welcomes the Euro-African Summit on migration to be held in Rabat in July 2006, to debate the issue of immigration to Europe from the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes any further steps taken to improve migration policy, and emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach that contains a clear vision of the most important actions to be taken within the field of migration policy, instead of supporting fragmented measures towards the development of this policy;\n",
        "9.   Recommends that the Council take appropriate measures to ensure better cooperation and coordination between those responsible for migration and those responsible for development in each Member State.\n",
        "10. Stresses that an increase in development aid is necessary but not sufficient to make migration a lever of development; calls on the European Union and the Member States to meet the political undertakings made in 2005;\n",
        "11. Recommends that migration and its impact on development be taken into account in an overarching manner in all discussions and actions to achieve the MDGs; points out that a comprehensive strategy will produce results only if an appropriate legal framework exists both within the EU and in the countries of origin;\n",
        "12. Emphasises that migration should be better integrated into policies and development plans and recommends that, at national level, migration be included in Poverty Reduction Strategy Documents (PRSD);\n",
        "13. Recognises the importance of diasporas in strengthening relations between the EU and countries of origin, particularly in the field of migration; calls for closer cooperation between institutions in developing countries and the EU Member States, including in the carrying-out of co-development projects;\n",
        "14. Takes the view that co-development, which consists in recognising and supporting the role of diasporas in serving the development of their countries of origin, should be fully recognised at European level;\n",
        "15. Stresses that, to make migration a lever of development, the Union should adopt two priority instruments:\n",
        "16. Considers that the AENEAS programme and the programme which will follow in 2007 should be used to serve a development strategy, in particular by financing co-development measures; must enable reliable systems for the efficient management of migrant flows and for the provision of support to countries of origin and transit countries to be strengthened; recommends, in pursuit of this aim, that the programme contain the following elements:\n",
        "17. Considers that the AENEAS programme and the programme which will follow in 2007 should be used to serve a development strategy, in particular by financing co-development measures, and that this objective should be strictly adhered to in order to avoid, for example, expenditure on further protection of the EU’s external borders;\n",
        "18. Proposes integrated regional development plans, focusing on the main immigration areas in Africa, to fund:\n",
        "19. Points out how difficult and how expensive it is for immigrants to send capital back to their countries of origin, and how little  transparency there is in a system which lies outside the banking sector; maintains that a secure system which protects the data of both sender and receiver is needed in order to ensure that remittances are sent through regulated channels, since other alternative systems used by immigrants may on occasion be usuriously expensive;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and national and international financial institutions to implement policies aimed at:\n",
        "21. Calls upon the Commission to draw up a proposal for a regulatory framework designed to make the sending of remittances by immigrants to their countries of origin less expensive and more transparent; points out that remittances are the second most important source of external finance for developing countries and that up to 20% of their total value is consumed by handling charges;\n",
        "22. Acknowledges the importance of the role played by SMEs in creating jobs and in contributing to development; urges the Commission - in cooperation with the European Investment Bank - to develop programmes which will prompt migrants to invest greater amounts in such businesses;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop programmes in order to involve skilled people in the diasporas in the process of development by covering the costs of wage differentials for highly skilled migrants prepared to return to their countries or by setting up ‘dual post’ systems for public sector personnel in southern countries (teachers, researchers and doctors); calls on the Commission to conduct a study on experiences in the Member States with regard to ‘dual posts’;\n",
        "24. Calls on the European Union and the Member States to encourage circular migration or commuting:\n",
        "25. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to encourage circular migration, with migrants going back and forth between their country of origin and the destination country, thereby making the knowledge and experience they have acquired available to their home country; points out that it is necessary to accompany circular migration with integration measures for outgoing and returning migrants; points to the role of civil society, NGOs and social partners in this process;\n",
        "26. Also welcomes the Commission's proposals to conduct a dialogue on matters relating to residence and work permits, and to administer migrant worker mobility programmes which will match the available skills of migrants with the needs of the developing country;\n",
        "27. Calls on the public authorities of the North and of the South to invest in the education and training of citizens; reiterates its support for the ‘20/20’ objective: 20% of public aid from the North and 20% of the national budgets of the South allocated to basic social services;\n",

        "35. Stresses that 'brain circulation' constitutes a key factor in strengthening the positive contribution of migration to development, given that developing countries participate fully in the exchange of skills in the global labour market; recommends that the Commission and the Member States make a resolute commitment in this area by proposing measures:\n",
        "36. Notes the fact that certain vocational and/or academic qualifications of workers from third countries are recognised either not at all or only with difficulty which makes it hard for such workers to enter the EU Member States’ employment market on equal terms; considers that migrants should have access to training programmes while employed in the EU so that they may develop their professional competency;\n",
        "37. Calls on the Commission to propose initiatives to facilitate recognition of professional qualifications and lay down minimum standards as regards the establishment of a European system of equivalences for foreign diplomas;\n",

        "42. Considers that the ACP-EU partnership is a particularly appropriate framework for putting forward joint responses to the migration issue, on the basis of Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement; calls on the Commission to include, in the current negotiations on EPAs or any negotiations on readmission agreements, the following objectives:\n",
        "43. Supports the proposal set out in the Brussels declaration and plan of action adopted on 13 April 2006 by the ACP ministers with responsibility for asylum, migration and mobility, which calls for the creation of a Virtual Observatory for ACP Migration with the purpose of gathering complete and independent information in order to develop ACP solutions to the challenges of migration;\n",
        "44. Welcomes the establishment of the ACP-EU facility on migration by the end of 2006; calls, however, on the Commission to clarify its objectives and guarantee that this instrument will not be diverted from its development objectives;\n",
        "45. Questions the appropriateness and effectiveness of agreements and readmission clauses aimed at linking financial and technical aid to the ‘performance’ of third countries in terms of readmission; emphasises that this policy of demanding something in return threatens to impoverish the countries producing migrants;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Commission to propose measures to strengthen the Southern countries' capacity to manage autonomous migration policies under the European Migration Fund or the ACP-EU facility;\n",
        "47. Stresses that the African Union and African regional organisations can play an important role in channelling economic migration in Africa, e.g. through cooperation agreements for co-development between the EU and the countries in which migration originates and bilateral and multilateral agreements, including clauses relating to respect for human rights and ILO standards, and considers that the European Union should support such initiatives;\n",
        "48. Calls on the Commission, together with the countries concerned, to draw up a strategy designed to support the countries of transit and destination which shoulder the heaviest burden of migrants and to consider action programmes for migrants in identified ‘migration poles’ and transit areas by targeting the most vulnerable groups of migrants (women and lone children) with the following objectives:\n",
        "49. Calls for these action programmes to focus in particular on the analysis of the psychological effects of migration and expulsion and on psychological care and support for women and children suffering from the negative effects;\n",
        "50. Encourages the countries of transit and origin to take an active part in the new approach to migration and development;\n",

        "53. Is concerned by the financial difficulties facing the HCR; is of the opinion that the Commission should step up its financial support for projects being run by the HCR and that the EU, which is the main contributor to the HCR budget, should bring pressure to bear on the other donors in order to ensure that the HCR has sufficient resources to carry out its role in the best conditions;\n",

        "60. Stresses the importance of the exchange of best practices, among the Member States and also with third countries, particularly developing countries;\n",
        "61. Regrets that the Commission has not taken properly into account the gender approach in its communication on 'Migration and Development: Some concrete orientations'; proposes the setting up of a permanent and high-level interinstitutional task force in charge of monitoring the development of European immigration policy from a gender perspective in particular to develop gender impact assessment tools before the adoption of any measures in the field of immigration policy;\n",
        "62. Calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt EU guidelines and concrete and targeted gender objectives and indicators in the field of immigration policy, including awareness-raising actions at national level, ensuring the integration of a gender perspective into immigration policy and a regular assessment of policies from a gender perspective;\n",
        "63. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to establish a legal framework guaranteeing immigrant women the right to hold their own passport and residence permit and making it possible to hold a person criminally responsible for taking these documents away;\n",

        "90. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, the governments of the EU Member States and ACP countries, the ACP EU-Council and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The aim of this own-initiative report is to analyse the link between international migration and development as a basis for drawing up recommendations for the European Union’s cooperation and development policy. At the beginning of the 21st century, there are 175 million migrants in the world (3% of the world population). This figure has virtually tripled in 40 years. 40% of migrants live in developing countries. The reasons for migration vary. Population growth and poverty are essential factors. However, the history of particular countries, cultural links, language and anti-democratic regimes are also important factors in the migration process. The European Union has a major role to play in making migration a lever of development. This report is intended as a ‘tool box’ from which it can draw ideas in pursuing this objective. However, it cannot be exhaustive, for two reasons.\n",

        "2.   Encourages the countries of transit and origin to take an active part in the new approach to migration and development;\n",
        "3.   Underlines the importance of remittances and stresses the need to find ways of transferring funds more quickly, securely and cheaply to the recipients, which would help to facilitate productive investment in developing countries;\n",
        "4.   Recognises the importance of diasporas in strengthening relations between the EU and countries of origin, particularly in the field of migration; calls for closer cooperation between institutions in developing countries and the EU Member States, including in the carrying-out of co-development projects;\n",
        "5.   Welcomes the initiatives to reverse the brain drain from certain countries and specialised sectors so that it is transformed into circular migration, and calls for support for building up mutual cooperation between the EU and the countries of origin by means of, for example, institutions and programmes such as AENEAS;\n",

        "21.3.2006 for the Committee on Development onDevelopment and Migration (2005/2244(INI)) Draftswoman: Ona Juknevičienė The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Development, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution:\n",
        "1.   Considers that clear and well-defined economic migration policy can provide a possible partial short-term solution to shortages in the labour markets arising from the demographic changes which the population of Europe is undergoing; notes that such a policy must not neglect  the promotion and realisation of the labour potential of the national labour markets (nationals and already resident migrants);\n",
        "2.   Calls on the Member States to adopt a fair and transparent procedure to facilitate migrants' access to employment with decent working and health and safety conditions, and conditions of recruitment by firms;\n",
        "3.   Points out that migration and integration are closely linked and that if migration is to be successful and if all the parties concerned are to benefit, migration strategies must be accompanied by holistic multidimensional integration strategies;\n",
        "4.   Notes that most migrants (irrespective of their official status) live in towns and cities and that those towns and cities must respond to migration-related challenges and opportunities, using whatever powers and resources are available; this should be reflected in all migration and development programmes and policies, including programmes such as AENEAS and EuropeAid;\n",
        "5.   Recognises that the phenomenon of 'brain drain', where the intellectual, academic and professional resources of third countries are reduced as a result of migration to the EU, has a negative impact on those countries' development as a whole by taking away their professional resources; considers however, that attention should be paid to unscrupulous agencies which recruit trained staff under false pretences; welcomes the Commission's proposal to encourage circular migration, with migrants going back and forth between their country of origin and the destination country, thereby making the knowledge and experience they have acquired available to their home country; points out that it is necessary to accompany circular migration with integration measures for outgoing and returning migrants; points to the role of civil society, NGOs and social partners in this process; considers that Member States benefiting from migration should also contribute to meeting training needs in third countries; ; considers it vital that provision should be made to prevent forced migration, particularly with regard to the prevention, monitoring and reduction of human trafficking;\n",
        "6.   Also welcomes the Commission's proposals to conduct a dialogue on matters relating to residence and work permits, and to administer migrant worker mobility programmes which will match the available skills of migrants with the needs of the developing country;\n",
        "7.   Notes the fact that certain vocational and/or academic qualifications of workers from third countries are recognised either not at all or only with difficulty which makes it hard for such workers to enter the EU Member States’ employment market on equal terms; considers that migrants should have access to training programmes while employed in the EU so that they may develop their professional competency;\n",
        "8.   Calls on the Commission to open a dialogue with the governments of countries of  origin without delay, in order to achieve balanced legislation, as well as financial and technical assistance, that allows migration and enables professional experience to be developed; calls on it, within the context of this dialogue, to enhance the development of specific measures in the sectors particularly affected by the brain drain (e.g. health care, education and training), in cooperation with the countries concerned; urges the Commission, therefore, to design country-specific programmes which can bring back human, financial, economic and social capital to developing countries in order to strengthen democratic development and the respect and observance of fundamental values;\n",
        "9.   Notes that migrants can contribute significantly to the development of their home countries by experience gained from working or studying in the EU, but it must be recognised that it should be each migrant's own personal choice whether and in which way to contribute to their home country's development;\n",
        "10. Considers that remittances constitute very important financial flows to developing countries and welcomes the Commission's proposals to simplify transfers and make them cheaper, and to open up opportunities for migrants who wish to use part of their remittances for any form of investment that supports development in their home country;\n",
        "11. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to consider measures concerning the transfer of pension rights, the recognition of qualifications and the operation of mechanisms to facilitate the mobility of researchers and other professionals to enable them, should they so wish, to return to their country of origin and successfully reintegrate;\n",
        "12. Expects the Commission, when taking measures against organised trafficking in human beings from developing countries, not to criminalise the victims, but to focus on punishing the perpetrators; notes that many women who are victims of human trafficking have no access to legal or social protection; calls on the Member States to grant these women the possibility of long-term residence;\n",
        "13.  Notes the increased exploitation of migrant workers and calls on the Member States to ensure the enforcement of European and national employment legislation and to provide all migrant workers with legal and civil protection against abuse and exploitation;\n",
        "14. Points out that research and training undertaken by immigrants from developing countries within the EU must be accompanied by the creation of suitable conditions for young business people so that the latter have greater motivation for investing in their countries of origin, with a view to ensuring that remittances of money can be used to greater effect;\n",
        "15. Acknowledges the importance of the role played by SMEs in creating jobs and in contributing to development; urges the Commission - in cooperation with the European Investment Bank - to develop programmes which will prompt migrants to invest greater amounts in such businesses;\n",
        "16. Recognises that it is vital to encourage young people to maintain some form of relationship with their country of origin and, enable them, should they choose to, to maintain a commitment to the development of that country; calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop various youth exchange schemes( to take initiatives under the 7th research framework programme and to promote closer cultural and educational links with the third countries concerned; strengthening cooperation between educational establishments in the EU and the developing countries and to support reintegration measures;\n",
        "17. Also recognises the need to review, in the light of more recent developments, the restrictive measures preventing the free movement of migrant workers from the new Member States with a view to making better use of the EU's existing labour force;\n",
        "18. Calls upon the Commission (in association with the Member States) to promote and develop exchange programmes for students and young graduates from developing countries which - as in the case of the Erasmus, Erasmus-Mundus, Comenius, Sócrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes (which have achieved fairly good results) - will help to secure the objectives of temporary migration and enable lessons and sound practices to be transferred to the students’ and graduates’ countries of origin;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission and Member States to improve the non-financial, social-professional contribution side of development by helping countries map their diasporas and build links with them, assessing the role of young people, improving integration and citizenship as well as linking the relevant stakeholders in the field of economic migration such as non-governmental organisations and Social Partners in countries of origin and destination. European Union is faced with great challenges, the demographic changes being among the most important ones. Due to the ageing of population, the EU in a very near future will not be able to satisfy EU labour market demands. Hence, it is necessary to develop clear and well defined strategies and policies that would help to prevent or at least, mitigate the damaging economic and social consequences. One of the possible ways to respond to the EU labour market demands is the economic migration which covers migration from the developing countries to the EU. Although the migration policy has always been the competence of the MS, it is time to respond to the arisen challenges on the EU level. However, it must be noted, that economic migration can be only a temporary solution and must provide benefits not only to the EU but to the emigrants' country of origin as well. Therefore, in order to reduce the damaging effects of brain drain in the migrants' home country and to help those countries to effectively use considerable benefits received from the return migrants, the EU should encourage various measures, including circular migration, closer links with diaspora, promotion of youth cultural and educational exchange programmes.\n",

        "1.  Considers that the admission of economic migrants can bring benefits to all the parties concerned;\n",
        "2.  Considers that European migration and development policy should be based above all on the principles of solidarity with third countries and co-development in order to tackle the underlying causes of migration and, in particular, eradicate poverty;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes any further steps taken to improve migration policy, and emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach that contains a clear vision of the most important actions to be taken within the field of migration policy, instead of supporting fragmented measures towards the development of this policy;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Member States to introduce a genuine admission policy based on respect for human rights and international law;\n",
        "5.  Calls for the Commission and the Member States to put forward practical proposals to promote access to legal migration channels in order to combat the illegal labour market and the exploitation to which migrant workers are subjected;\n",
        "6.  Emphasises that the Union should integrate the joint management of migration flows more efficiently in its relations with third countries and that the association agreements should reflect the commitment of both parties to accept their responsibilities in the field of border controls and management of migration flows; stresses, however, that this must take place on a partnership basis and that the European Union should under no circumstances externalise the management of its borders with third countries; also points out that the management of migration flows should not be a precondition for any association agreement;\n",
        "7.  Stresses the positive effect of active involvement of migrants in the development of their country of origin on their integration in the country of residence; believes that a partnership approach between the Union and countries of origin should mainstream migration policy; therefore encourages migrants to maintain and develop their links with their countries of origin;\n",
        "8.  Points out the necessity of the effective integration of migrants; however, is convinced that it is important to recognise the ´dual identity´ of migrants; in this regard, calls on the Commission and the Member States to avoid the trap of forced assimilation;considers, in other words, that migrants should be able to participate in the economic, social, cultural and civil life of the host country and, on the other hand, that they should respect the fundamental norms and values of the host society and participate actively in the integration process, without having to relinquish their own identity;\n",
        "9.  Draws attention to the need to maximize the developmental impact of return migration and circular migration; favours the examining of possible measures to simplify former migrants' return to their former host country or even to provide mechanisms and channels to enable migrants to move relatively easily between their countries of origin and destination;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to propose initiatives to facilitate recognition of professional qualifications and lay down minimum standards as regards the establishment of a European system of equivalences for foreign diplomas;\n",
        "11. Recognises the great importance of ensuring at least a common minimum level of rights across the Union for third country nationals; therefore, welcomes the plans to provide a level playing field for all immigrants gaining access to the Union's labour markets;\n",

        "13. Welcomes the plan to establish a fair and transparent admission procedure for seasonal workers and to grant them rights; believes that due consideration should be given to semi-skilled and low-skilled migrants; considers that it is important to protect this particularly vulnerable category of workers from discrimination and exploitation;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to examine possible actions to be taken to ensure the transfer of pensions and social security entitlements of migrants returning to their countries of origin;\n",
        "15. Favours the examining of possible measures to make remittances cheaper, faster and safer; however, stresses the great importance of the fight against money laundering and of the need to avoid any possibility of supporting terrorist organisations;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission to strengthen measures on remittances, so that they comply with the proposal for a Regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds; points out that formal and recorded remittances are preferable to informal flows because they reduce the risk that migrants and recipients will be exploited by clandestine money laundering;\n",
        "17. Welcomes the plan to develop a comprehensive and coherent approach to ethical recruitment of staff in sectors particularly vulnerable to brain drain.\n",

        "10. Regrets that there is a lack of recognition of the links between trafficking and migration; notes that many women who are victims of human trafficking have no access to legal or social protection; calls on the Commission and the Member States to focus in their anti-trafficking strategies on prevention and protection of the victims; calls on the Member States to grant these women the possibility of long-term residence;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission to carry out a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of development aid expenditure and programmes in third countries and to assess their results in improving the position of women in migrants' countries of origin;\n",

        "19. Calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt EU guidelines and concrete and targeted gender objectives and indicators in the field of immigration policy, including awareness-raising actions at national level, ensuring the integration of a gender perspective into immigration policy and a regular assessment of policies from a gender perspective;\n",
