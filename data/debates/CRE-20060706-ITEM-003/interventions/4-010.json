{"speaker": "Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE-DE),", "english": "Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . – Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Carlotti. I congratulate her for her report and I thank her for taking up the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on behalf of which I am speaking today, in particular noting that the link between immigration and development is an integral part of the foreign policy agenda of the European Union. It has been so from the time that the Barcelona Process was instituted, but it has continued in all other issues of our relations with the countries of origin and transit. It is very important to tackle the issue of immigration, to manage migratory flows when we achieve the understanding and the cooperation of the countries of origin and transit.\nAs has been said by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, remittances around the world to developing countries amount to USD 232 billion per year, which is double the size of foreign aid to developing countries by everybody else. Therefore, this is the significance of facilitating remittances, facilitating the issue of circular migration, thus gaining the confidence of the countries we want to cooperate with. We are not aiming at the brain-drain that they are so afraid of; we do not talk only about illegal immigration, but we know how to take best advantage of immigration in view of our ageing population and the need that lies ahead.\nI would like to conclude by saying that by putting order in the financial institutions, as regards both the sending and receiving side, we can also deal with the issue of terrorist financing that has been thought to come via charity organisations and so on in Europe.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . – Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Carlotti.
