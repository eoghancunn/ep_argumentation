        "1.Considers that the ever-growing number of Community Agencies and the activities of certain of them do not seem to form part of an overall policy framework, and that the remits of some Agencies do not always reflect the real needs of the Union or the expectations of its citizens, and notes that in general terms the Agencies do not always have a good image or a good press;\n",
        "2.Invites the Commission therefore to define an overall policy framework for the setting up of new Community Agencies and to present a cost-benefit study before the setting up of any new agency, while being careful to avoid any overlap of activities between Agencies or with the remits of other European organisations;\n",

        "11.Notes that the number of Agencies is constantly increasing and that, in accordance with the Commission’s political responsibility for the operation of the Agencies, which goes far beyond mere logistical support, there is an even higher need for the Directorates-General of the Commission charged with the setting up and monitoring of Agencies to develop a common approach to the Agencies; considers that a structure similar to the one created by the Agencies for coordination among the DGs concerned would be a pragmatic way forward towards a common approach by the Commission on all matters relating to the Agencies;\n",

        "15.Takes the view that the establishment by a number of Agencies of a shared support service aimed at making their computerised financial management systems consistent with those of the Commission is a measure that should be taken further and extended;\n",
        "16.Calls upon the Agencies to improve their cooperation and benchmarking with actors in the field; urges the Commission to adopt any measures it considers necessary to help the Agencies enhance their image and raise the profile of their activities;\n",
        "17.Calls upon the Commission to come up with a proposal to harmonise the format of the annual reporting by the Agencies to develop performance indicators which would allow a comparison of their efficiency;\n",
        "18.Invites the Agencies to present at the beginning of every year performance indicators against which they could be measured;\n",
        "19.Invites all Agencies to increasingly use SMART objectives which should lead to more realistic planning and implementation of goals;\n",
        "20.Agrees with the Court of Auditors that the Commission also bears responsibility for the (financial) management of the Agencies; therefore, urges the Commission to monitor and where necessary direct and help the management of the different Agencies, especially in relation to the proper application of tender procedures, transparency of recruitment procedures, sound financial management (underspending and overbudgeting) and most importantly the proper application of the rules concerning the internal control framework;\n",
        "21.Considers that the Agencies' work programmes should express their contributions in operational and measurable terms and that due consideration should be given to the Commission's Internal Control Standards;\n",
        "21.Notes that the implementation of the budget, the utilisation rates for commitment appropriations (94 %) and payment appropriations (82 %) were on the whole high, and that for administrative expenditure (Title II) the utilisation rate for commitment appropriations was less than 90 %, with more than 40 % of the commitments made being carried over to the following financial year;\n",
