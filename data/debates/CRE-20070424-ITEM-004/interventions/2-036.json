{"speaker": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE).", "english": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE). – Madam President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, presiding efficiently over us.\nFirst of all a comment to Mr Mote, who, I am sorry to see, has not bothered to stay to listen to the rest of the debate. His solution to the problems of corruption and waste in Europe is to add another layer of bureaucracy by hiring a team of accountants from the private sector. It seems to me a completely absurd solution, piling cost on cost.\nOur group will support Amendments 1 and 3 calling for clarification of the costs of our working in three different places, which is an absurdity that the public cannot understand and we cannot understand. We want clarification on that. However, we are very puzzled that the PPE-DE Group has tabled four amendments – 79, 80, 81 and 83 – that would delete other useful parts of this report. Mrs De Lange, who just spoke for the PPE-DE Group, baffles me. She said that we want to avoid giving the public impression that money is being wrongly spent for the pension fund. I agree with her. However, the PPE-DE Group is proposing under Amendment 83 to delete an audit of Members’ allowances and how they are spent, which does not make sense at all. I would urge her to persuade the rest of her colleagues to withdraw those amendments seeking to delete useful things in this report and to support it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE). – Madam President, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, presiding efficiently over us.\nFirst of all a comment to Mr Mote, who, I am sorry to see, has not bothered to stay to listen to the rest of the debate.
