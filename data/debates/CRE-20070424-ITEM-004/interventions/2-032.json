{"speaker": "Ashley Mote,", "english": "Ashley Mote, on behalf of the ITS Group . – Madam President, I believe the Council of Ministers should consider as a matter of urgency appointing a team of genuinely independent, internationally respected accountants to carry out a full-scale investigation and analysis of the audit of this institution, its treasury, its accounting systems and controls and all its operational institutions as well, many of which trade commercially and yet routinely escape the full vigour of the law in their financial and business management.\nJust take the 2005 accounts: a team of independent forensic accountants have concluded that payments worth EUR 27 billion were simply not registered accurately in the accounts and such incredible unaccountability has produced some equally incredible and unacceptable consequences. We now know, for instance, that the EU has lost some EUR 600 billion over the years, which far exceeds the UK’s net contribution of GBP 75 billion since we joined.\nThe President of the Court of Auditors has admitted that there are serious ongoing problems: every annual report spells them out, page after page, and nothing much actually happens as a result. The statement of assurance is supposed to cover ‘down to the level of taxpayers’. Yet their interests are ignored year after year. The discrepancies between balances in one year and the next are regular, routine and unacceptable. In 2002, for instance, the difference was EUR 200 million. Last year, it was EUR 179 million, which is not much of an improvement over four years.
