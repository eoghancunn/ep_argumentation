{"speaker": "Vladimír Špidla,", "english": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Mr President, honourable Members, I should like, if I may, to thank Mrs Lévai for her report on the Commission recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services. I should like to point out that the catalyst for the Commission recommendation was originally authors’ fears: authors, composers and music publishers warned the Commission that they are not earning royalties from the use of their works on line.\nFrom our analysis it is clear, however, that it is too complicated for individual countries to manage the use of copyright works on line, particularly in a digital environment. As a result of the complex relationships between the collective management organisations (CRMs) policing these rights in each individual country, it seems that royalties do not reach authors and other right-holders. The purpose of the Commission recommendation is therefore to ensure that authors, composers and music publishers do receive their fair share of online royalties.\nSimilarly, I believe that it is possible to improve the system of issuing licences in such a way that it facilitates the development of new online services while also protecting and providing genuine support for the interests of copyright-holders. To put it clearly, the recommendation does not propose a concrete model for issuing licences, but puts forward the principle that when it comes to managing their online rights, right-holders should be free to choose the most advantageous and efficient form of management or licensing. The aim therefore is to ensure that right-holders earn royalties from the online use of their music works. This will in turn enable us to ensure complete protection for the value of the right-holders’ works. This is in no way a race to the bottom. This objective serves the interests of rights-holders and is reflected in the recommendation’s regulations relating to administering transparency, resolving disputes, the responsibilities of copyright managers and the balanced representation of all categories of copyright-holders on the boards of CRMs.\nThe Commission welcomes Parliament’s overwhelming support for this report. Even though we are still monitoring the impact of the recommendation and gathering the opinions of the interested parties, a number of initiatives have already been put in place with a view to strengthening management. In 2006, for example, the world trade association of music publishers and the umbrella organisation of European associations for the collective rights of authors adopted a joint statement establishing a set of rules for online copyright management.\nVarious right-holders including smaller CRMs and publishers have expressed enthusiasm for the business opportunities opened up by the recommendation of online music services. In the issuing of online service licences, the Commission sees an opportunity for the entire EU to acknowledge the value of music and to support different cultures and their musical works throughout the EU. The creation of new markets with specific music genres and the discovery of a genuine Internet public will unquestionably help support cultural diversity.\nThe report calls for the Commission to propose a directive on this issue. The Commission would note that the online market is developing and we must be extremely careful not to restrict its potential with an overly rigid approach. What is more, as I have said before, it is only now that we are looking into what the situation will be like after the recommendation has been adopted. I can assure everyone here that our goal is to guarantee right-holders royalties from their works and the users of rights the necessary licences in the simplest and most straightforward way. I believe it is vital to support and preserve Europe’s cultural diversity. The Commission will naturally keep Parliament informed.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission .
