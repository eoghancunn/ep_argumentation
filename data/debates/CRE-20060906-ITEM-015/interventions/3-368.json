{"speaker": "Elspeth Attwooll,", "english": "Elspeth Attwooll, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on a very thoughtful report. It identifies the crucial issues and contributes considerably to the debate concerning them.\nOf the amendments, we support only Amendment 2, taking the view that Amendments 1 and 3 are covered sufficiently by the existing text.\nClearly, whatever system we develop must be voluntary, in the sense that companies should be able to choose whether or not to become involved. It must also respect the need for other types of labelling, such as those concerning quality. That said, the report rightly draws attention to the difficulties of doing no more than establishing minimum criteria for voluntary schemes.\nFAO standards mean that there must be a dimension of public ownership. This requires some form of independent monitoring at the very least.\nFor these reasons, we believe that a single Community labelling scheme merits fuller exploration. There are clearly potential advantages and disadvantages, but it should be possible to devise something which recognises different fisheries and products, but is neither cumbersome nor bureaucratic.\nWhatever the eventual choice, speaking personally as a consumer rather than a legislator, I would make one plea for the use of some clearly identifiable common symbol, comparable to the CE mark currently employed, where we have harmonised rules concerning the health and safety of products. We hope that Parliament will give overwhelming endorsement to the report and we look to speedy progress towards an appropriate outcome.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elspeth Attwooll, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on a very thoughtful report.
