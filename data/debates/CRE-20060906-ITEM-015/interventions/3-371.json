The danger is that when the EU bureaucracy and red tape get to work, the system that emerges could be unwieldy, excessively burdensome and very expensive. The fisheries sector already suffers enough from EU stipulations and restrictions. The most that the EU should do is to set minimum requirements to be met by voluntary eco-labelling schemes.

These can be secured by setting sensible and manageable minimum standards. We do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors. We need sometimes to temper Utopian environmental demands with business reality. Whatever the eventual outcome, I hope that will be a hallmark of the scheme.
