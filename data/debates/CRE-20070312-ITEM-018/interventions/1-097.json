{"speaker": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE),", "english": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his report. I think he has managed to present a report that can secure widespread support in this Chamber.\nI think it is important to make some remarks about corporate social responsibilities. First of all, the main task of companies is to deliver the services and products they are established for and to be run at a profit, because otherwise they will not survive. If they cannot fulfil these main tasks, they will fail in their fundamental social responsibility as employers and as producers of services and goods.\nI think it is important to underline this when we discuss how to define corporate social responsibilities. Our point of view – because we have discussed this question in the ITRE committee as well as within our group – is that it should be a matter of voluntary responsibility. It has to be performed on its own merits and as a part of the responsibility that the individual company has in society.\nCompanies have a social role in society. They must be good employers, delivering services and products of a high quality, because otherwise they will lose credibility and they will lose out in the market. But there are also grounds for saying that they must behave well in their own terms, because good and strong companies who stand up for fundamental values, whether in Europe or anywhere else in the world, are contributing to a better world, but also to a better economy and to better products and services.\nThere should be voluntary responsibility, because otherwise legislation would be needed and that is another matter. If we try to streamline too much, we will lose the variety and the dynamism that each company can deliver by making the most of its opportunities to be a good employer, a good company and a good service and product provider.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his report.
