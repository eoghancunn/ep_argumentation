    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Is convinced that increasing social and environmental responsibility by business, linked to the principle of corporate accountability, represents an essential element of the European Social Model, of Europe's strategy for Sustainable Development and in meeting the social challenges of economic globalisation;\n",
        "2.  Welcomes the Commission Communication in enabling new impetus to the EU debate on corporate social responsibility (CSR) but notes the concerns expressed by some key stakeholders about a lack of transparency and balance in the consultation undertaken before publication;\n",
        "3.  Recognises that an open debate remains between different stakeholder groups on an appropriate definition of CSR and that the concept of \"beyond compliance\" may enable some companies to claim social responsibility whilst at the same time not respecting local or international laws; believes that EU assistance to governments of third countries in implementing social and environmental regulation consistent with international conventions, together with effective inspection regimes, are a necessary complement to advancing the CSR of European business worldwide;\n",
        "4.  Believes that CSR policies should be promoted on their own merits, neither as a substitute for appropriate regulation in relevant fields, nor as a covert approach to introducing such legislation; calls for the CSR debate at the European level to be 'depolarised' by neither supporting exclusively voluntary nor mandatory approaches; reiterating an essentially voluntary approach but enabling - without obligation - research based on clear social and environmental objectives and without excluding further dialogue and research on binding commitments;\n",
        "5.  Notes that the proliferation of voluntary CSR initiatives could be perceived as an obstacle to more companies adopting CSR policies, particularly small enterprises, as well as a disincentive for companies to pursue more credible CSR actions, whilst at the same time demonstrating the importance given to it, and the need to create incentives for more ambitious CSR policies; calls on the Commission to encourage dissemination of the good practice resulting from voluntary CSR initiatives; believes that the Commission should also consider establishing a list of criteria for enterprises to respect if they claim to be responsible;\n",
        "6.  Believes that the credibility of voluntary CSR initiatives is further dependent on a commitment to incorporating existing internationally agreed standards and principles, and on a multi-stakeholder approach, as recommended by the EU Multistakeholder Forum (MSF), as well as on the application of independent monitoring and verification; recommends the creation of such a mechanism at European level;\n",
        "7.  Believes that the EU debate on CSR has approached the point where emphasis should be shifted from 'processes' to 'outcomes', leading to a measurable and transparent contribution from business in combating social exclusion and environmental degradation in Europe and around the world;\n",
        "8.  Recognises that many companies already make a large and growing effort to live up to their social responsibility;\n",
        "9.  Notes that markets and companies are at different stages of development across Europe; considers therefore that a one-size-fits-all method that seeks to impose a single model for corporate behaviour is not relevant and will not lead to meaningful uptake of CSR by companies; considers furthermore that emphasis should be placed upon the development of civil society and in particular consumer awareness about responsible production to promote the uptake of corporate responsibility which is long-lasting and of relevance to the particular national or regional context;\n",
        "10. Points out that CSR should tackle new areas such as lifelong learning, the organisation of work, equal opportunities, social inclusion, sustainable development and ethics, so as to act as an additional instrument for managing industrial change and restructuring;\n",
        "11. Notes the Commission's decision to set up a European Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility in partnership with several business networks; recommends that the Commission itself should ensure a single point of coordination to maintain an awareness of the Alliance's membership and activities, as well as agreeing clear objectives, timetables and strategic vision to inform its work; encourages European companies and companies operating in Europe, large and small, to embrace this initiative, and for the Alliance to be enhanced through the participation of other stakeholders;\n",
        "12. Believes that social dialogue has been an effective means of promoting CSR initiatives and that European works councils have also played a constructive role in developing best practice in relation to CSR;\n",
        "13. Suggests that a substantial increase in uptake of CSR practices amongst EU companies, the development of new models of best practice by genuine leaders amongst companies and trade union bodies of companies in different aspects of CSR, the identification and promotion of specific EU action and regulation to support CSR, and the assessment of the impact of such initiatives on the environment and on human and social rights could comprise the Alliance's core benchmarks of success; and that a deadline of two years be set for completion of the work of the 'laboratories' set up under its umbrella as suggested by CSR Europe;\n",
        "14. Notes that reconvening the EU Multistakeholder Forum was a late addition to the Communication, and that measures need to be taken to build the confidence of different stakeholders that a genuine dialogue will take place leading to a real impact of EU policies and programmes to incentivise and apply CSR in EU business; believes that lessons should be learnt in relation to the two years that the MSF previously operated, positive in terms of the \"no fame, no shame\" rule and in particular the use of independent rapporteurs; points out, however, that improvements are needed in relation to consensus-building; also urges the case for Commission representatives to engage more actively in the debate;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission to invite representatives from a number of national, regional and local governments committed to using procurement and other public policy tools to advance CSR to form their own 'laboratory' under the 'Alliance' and to integrate their findings in its future work;\n",
        "16. Backs efforts by the Commission to extend membership of the MSF to include investors, the education sector and public authorities, whilst insisting there must remain the opportunity for sustained dialogue to achieve agreed goals;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to encourage, in the monitoring of progress on CSR, greater female participation in the Multi-Stakeholder Forum and the exchange of information and good practices in the field of gender equality;\n",
        "18. Supports calls for mandatory disclosure for corporate and other lobbyists and for balanced access between business groupings and other stakeholder groups towards EU policy-making itself;\n",
        "19. Welcomes the Communication's objective to link CSR to the economic, social and environmental aims of the Lisbon Agenda, precisely because it considers that a serious approach to CSR by companies may contribute both to increasing job numbers and improving working conditions and ensuring respect for workers’ rights and promoting research - and development of technological innovations; supports the principle of \"responsible competitiveness\" as an integral part of the Commission's Programme for Innovation and Competitiveness; challenges European companies to include in their reporting how they are contributing to the Lisbon goals;\n",
        "20. Recognises that effective competition rules, inside and outside Europe, are an essential element of ensuring responsible business practice, in particular by enabling fair treatment and access for locally-based SMEs;\n",
        "21. Reiterates that the implementation, within CSR, of responsible and non-discriminatory recruitment practices that promote the employment of women and disadvantaged persons contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives;\n",
        "22. Notes a contradiction between competitive sourcing strategies by companies seeking continuous improvements in flexibility and cost, and voluntary CSR commitments seeking to avoid exploitative employment practices and promote long-term relationships with suppliers; welcomes further dialogue on this point;\n",
        "23. Suggests, in this connection, that the assessments and monitoring of European companies acknowledged as being responsible be extended to cover their activities and those of their subcontractors outside the European Union, as well, so as to be sure that CSR also benefits third countries and especially developing countries, in accordance with the ILO conventions concerning, in particular, the freedom to form trade unions, the ban on child labour and that on forced labour, and more specifically women, migrants, indigenous peoples and minority groups;\n",
        "24. Recognises CSR as an important business driver and calls for the integration of social policies, such as respect for workers’ rights, a fair wages policy, the avoidance of discrimination, lifelong learning, etc., and environmental issues focusing particularly on the dynamic promotion of sustainable development, both in support for new products and processes through EU innovation and trade policies, as well as in drawing up sector, sub-regional and city-based competitiveness strategies;\n",
        "25. Emphasises that undertakings demonstrating social responsibility make an important contribution towards redressing the inequalities that affect particularly women and disadvantaged persons, including disabled people, on the job market, not least as regards access to employment, welfare benefits, training, career development and a fair wages policy; emphasises that undertakings should conduct their recruitment policy in accordance with Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions[16];\n",
        "26. Welcomes the trend for larger companies to publish voluntary social and environmental reports in recent years; notes that the number of such reports had been rising since 1993 but has now become fairly static and that only a minority use internationally accepted standards and principles, cover the company's full supply chain or involve independent monitoring and verification;\n",
        "27. Reiterates Parliament's support for integrated social, environmental and financial reporting by companies backed by regulation, perhaps with a minimum threshold to avoid disproportionate cost for smaller enterprises; calls for in-depth research on implementation of minimum requirements for social and environmental reporting within the 2001 Commission Recommendation on Environmental Disclosure, the 2003 Accounts Modernisation Directive, and the 2003 Prospectus Directive, supporting effective transposition across all Member States, and undertaking consultation on the potential for strengthening these requirements when they are next reviewed, including interpretations of the materiality of social and environmental risk under existing disclosure requirements;\n",
        "28. Recognises the current limitations of the CSR 'industry' in relation to corporate behaviour measurement, social audit and certification, especially in relation to cost, comparability and independence, and believes that it will be necessary to develop a professional framework including specific qualifications in this field;\n",
        "29. Recommends that the Commission extends the responsibility of directors of companies with more than 1000 employees to encompass the duty for the directors themselves to minimise any harmful social and environmental impact of companies' activities;\n",
        "30. Reiterates its support for the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, in particular its requirement for external verification and the obligation on Member States to promote the scheme, and believes there is scope to develop similar schemes concerning the protection of labour, social and human rights;\n",
        "31. Supports the Code of Good Practice of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance, as a leading example of promoting collaboration between existing labelling initiatives, in preference to the creation of new social labels at the national or European level;\n",
        "32. Believes that consumers, customers, employees and investors must have the opportunity to select or reject products/suppliers, jobs and companies depending on whether they are more or less responsible in terms of the environment and social conditions;\n",
        "33. Urges the EU to adopt a European standard for product labelling where observance of human rights and fundamental workers' rights are part of the labelling scheme;\n",
        "34. Calls on the Commission to implement a mechanism by which victims, including third-country nationals, can seek redress against European companies in the national courts of the Member States;\n",
        "35. Notes the omission of the issue of Socially Responsible Investment from the Communication, backs full participation by investors as stakeholders in the CSR debate at the EU level including in the MSF, supports industry calls for transparency rather than prescription through the introduction of EU-wide \"statement of interest principles\" for investment funds;\n",
        "36. Points out that consumers play an important part when it is a question of creating incentives for responsible production and responsible business practice; however, believes that the situation is at present impenetrable for consumers on account of confusion between the different national product standards and product labelling schemes, all of which is helping to undermine the existing social product labels; draws attention to the fact that, at the same time, considerable costs are incurred by companies when switching between many different national requirements and standards; also points out that it is expensive to set up monitoring mechanisms to oversee social product labelling, particularly for smaller countries;\n",
        "37. Calls on the Commission to regulate joint and several liability on the part of general or principal undertakings in order to deal with abuses in the subcontracting and outsourcing of workers and to set up a transparent and competitive internal market for all companies;\n",
        "38. Supports the efforts of Eurostat to develop indicators to measure performance on CSR in the context of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy as well as the Commission's intention to develop new indicators in order to measure awareness and the consumption of EU eco-labelled products and the share of production from EMAS-registered enterprises;\n",
        "39. Recalls previous consideration given to the appointment of an EU ombudsman on CSR to undertake independent enquiries on CSR-related issues at the request of companies or any stakeholder group; invites further reflection on this and similar proposals in the future;\n",
        "40. Believes that CSR policies can be enhanced by better awareness and implementation of existing legal instruments; calls on the Commission to organise and promote awareness campaigns and monitor the implementation of the application of foreign direct liability according to the Brussels Convention, and on the application of the directives on misleading advertising and unfair commercial practices to adherence by companies to their voluntary CSR codes of conduct;\n",
        "41. Reiterates the need to use simple, easily understandable language so as to encourage companies to promote CSR;\n",
        "42. Restates that major efforts should be undertaken by the Commission and EU governments at national, regional and local level to use the opportunities provided by the revision of the Public Procurement Directives in 2004 to support CSR by applying social and environmental clauses to their contracts, to disqualify companies where necessary including in instances of corruption; and for the Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to apply strict social and environmental criteria to all grants and loans allocated to private sector companies, backed by clear complaints mechanisms; building on the example linking public procurement and compliance with the ILO Core Conventions and OECD Guidelines in the Netherlands and with the SA8000 CSR standard by several Italian provinces; recalls that Member States should take steps to ensure that any export credit guarantees comply with the highest environmental and social criteria and should not be used for projects that run counter to agreed EU policy goals concerning, for example, energy or armaments;\n",
        "43. Reiterates that good regulation and legislation has been developed in the field of soft law, and that such legislation offers incentives to companies who comply with CSR principles, while allowing companies that have not yet signed up to CSR principles the necessary time to adapt;\n",
        "44. Welcomes the commitments repeated in the Communication for the Commission to support and promote CSR across all of its fields of activityand calls for a major effort to translate these commitments into concrete actions across the board;\n",
        "45. Believes that the CSR debate must not be separated from questions of corporate accountability, and that issues of the social and environmental impact of business, relations with stakeholders, the protection of minority shareholders' rights and the duties of company directors in this regard should be fully integrated in the Commission's Corporate Governance Action Plan; points out that these issues should form part of the debate on CSR; asks the Commission to take these particular points into consideration and to come forward with firm proposals to address them;\n",
        "46. Welcomes direct financial support for CSR initiatives from the Commission, in particular to encourage innovation, enable stakeholder involvement and to assist potential victims' groups in relation to alleged malpractice including corporate manslaughter; encourages the Commission to develop, in particular, mechanisms that ensure that communities affected by European companies are entitled to a fair and accessible justice process; underlines the importance of the B34000 EU-budget line for pilot projects such as those involving Employee Community Engagement, hypothecated funds to support CSR within the Commission's Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and for 3 % of Social Science and Humanities research to be devoted to business in society under the FP7 Research and Development Programme; calls for far greater efforts to be made by the Commission to support CSR in relation to EU companies operating in third countries through its external assistance programmes;\n",
        "47. Welcomes the commitment to make Education one of eight priority action areas, calls for a deeper integration of CSR in the Socrates programme, the provision of a broad range of CSR materials in the future European Teaching Resource Centre, and the creation of a European online directory of business schools and universities on CSR and sustainable development;\n",
        "48. Encourages initiatives at EU and Member State level to improve the teaching of responsible management and production in Europe’s business schools;\n",
        "49. Points out that social and environmental responsibility accords to governmental and non-governmental organisations as much as business, and calls on the Commission to fulfil its commitment to publish an annual report on social and environmental impact of its own direct activities, as well as developing policies to encourage the staff of EU institutions to undertake voluntary community engagement;\n",
        "50. Considers that, as part of CSR, companies could sponsor cultural and educational activities that offered added value to European policies in the field of culture and lifelong learning;\n",
        "51. Calls on the Commission to better integrate CSR in its trade policies, whilst respecting WTO rules and not creating unjustified trade barriers, by seeking to introduce provisions in all bilateral, regional or multilateral agreements binding articles in compliance with internationally agreed CSR standards such as the OECD Guidelines, ILO Tripartite Declaration and Rio Principles, as well as reservation of regulatory powers on issues of human rights, social and environmental responsibility; welcomes the support given to these objectives in the Communication on Decent Work; repeats its call for Commission Delegations in third countries, acting within the Commission's competence, to promote and act as contact points in relation to the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprise; calls on the Commission and Member States to improve the functioning of National Contact Points in particular in dealing with specific instances raised concerning alleged violations throughout operations and supply chains of European companies worldwide;\n",
        "52. Notes the contribution made by the international fair trade movement in pioneering responsible business practices for sixty years and proving that such practices are viable and sustainable throughout the supply chain; calls on the Commission to take the experience of the fair trade movement into account and to explore systematically how this experience can be used in the context of CSR;\n",
        "53. Asks the Commission to make sure that EU-based transnational companies with production facilities in third countries, in particular those participating in the GSP+ scheme, abide by core ILO standards, social and environmental covenants and international agreements to achieve a world-wide balance between economic growth and higher social and environmental standards;\n",
        "54. Welcomes the commitment of the European Consensus on Development to support CSR as a priority action; calls for practical action for DG Development to play an active role in the debate, to examine working conditions and conditions in using natural resources in the developing world, to work with domestic enterprises as well as the overseas operations of EU companies, sub-contracting enterprises and their stakeholders, to tackle abuse and malpractice in supply chains, to combat poverty and to create equitable growth;\n",
        "55. Suggests that the Commission targets the participation of SMEs in CSR through joint working with intermediary bodies, offering specific support for the participation of cooperatives/social economy businesses through their specialist associations, uses the network of European Information Centres to directly promote CSR initiatives and considers the appointment of a CSR Envoy similar to the SME Envoy within DG Enterprise;\n",
        "56. Recommends that the Commission conduct an in-depth Europe-wide study on the different ways in which SMEs might participate in CSR and on the incentives for them to adopt CSR principles on a voluntary individual basis, and that it learn the proper lessons from the experience acquired and good practice in this area;\n",
        "57. Welcomes the Communication's commitment to enhance the participation of employees and their trade unions in CSR and reiterates its call for the Commission and social partners to build on the successful negotiation of now 50 International Framework Agreements and 30 European Framework Agreements in relation to mainly core labour standards for individual companies or sectors as one approach to developing corporate responsibility in Europe and the world; refers to the European works councils which are specially suited to promoting CSR and, in particular, to advancing fundamental workers' rights in multinational companies;\n",
        "58. Stresses the importance of the role of the social partners in promoting women’s employment and combating discrimination; encourages them to take initiatives, within a CSR framework, to encourage increasedparticipation by women in company boards,works councils and social dialogue bodies;\n",
        "59. Recommends that future CSR research goes beyond the simple 'business case' for CSR, to focus on the link between competitiveness and sustainable development, at the macro level (the EU and Member States), the meso level (industry sectors and supply chains) and the micro level (SMEs), and the interrelationship between them, as well as the impact of current CSR initiatives and possible violations of CSR principles; supports the leading role played by the European Academy of Business in Society in this respect; calls on the Commission to publish an authoritative 'Annual State of CSR' drawn up in cooperation with independent experts and researchers collating existing information, describing new trends and providing recommendations for future actions;\n",
        "60. Believes that the potential impact of CSR policies remains greatest in relation to companies' global supply chains, to enable responsible investment by companies to assist the fight against poverty in developing countries, to promote decent working conditions, to support principles of fair trade and good governance, as well as reducing the incidence of breaches of international standards, including labour standards, by corporations in countries where regulatory regimes are weak or non-existent;\n",
        "61. Calls on the Commission to launch specific research into that impact and to put forward proposals to increase responsible investment by firms and their responsibility;\n",
        "62. Recognises that a number of international CSR initiatives are more deeply-rooted and have attained a new maturity, including the recent publication of 'G3' guidelines by the Global Reporting Initiative, the removal of 200 companies by UN Global Compact and the appointment of a Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Business and Human Rights;\n",
        "63. Calls on the Commission to take a lead as regards global calls for the reform of company law, as the fundamental requirement for genuine, mainstreamed CSR;\n",
        "64. Expresses disappointment that the Commission did not accord greater priority to promoting global initiatives within its Communication, and calls on the Commission working with Member States and stakeholders to both develop a strategic vision and input to the development of CSR initiatives at the global level, as well as a major effort to significantly raise participation in such initiatives by EU companies;\n",
        "65. Calls on the Member States and Commission to support and promote respect for the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO) as a factor in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of undertakings in the areas in which they operate;\n",
        "66. Believes that the international dimension of CSR should be a stimulus for guidelines to be drawn up promoting the development of policies of this kind throughout the world;\n",
        "67. Calls on the Commission, working with other relevant partners, to organise a major international initiative in 2007 to mark the fifth anniversary of the commitment agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to undertake inter-governmental initiatives in the field of corporate accountability;\n",
        "68. Calls on the Commission to build on the success of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue on CSR in the 1990s, by organising a similar exercise between the EU and Japan;\n",
        "69. Encourages the further development of international initiatives for full revenue transparency by European companies on their activities in third countries, to uphold full respect for human rights in their operations in conflict zones and to reject lobbying including 'host-country agreements' drawn up by companies to undermine or evade the regulatory requirements in such countries;\n",
        "70. Calls on the Commission and Member States to contribute to supporting and strengthening the OECD Guidelines, in particular by conducting a review of the effectiveness of European national contact points (NCPs) and their role in effectively mediating between stakeholders to resolve conflicts; calls for the development of a model for European NCPs with best practice on their institutional set-up, visibility, accessibility for all stakeholders and handling of complaints; calls for a broad interpretation of the definition of investment in the application of the OECD Guidelines to ensure supply-chain issues are covered under implementation procedures;\n",
        "71. Calls for support for the development of the Global Reporting Initiative by inviting leading EU companies to participate in new sectoral approaches covering such areas as construction, chemicals and agriculture; to foster research on participation by SMEs, to enable outreach work particularly in central and eastern European countries, and to develop sustainability indices in conjunction with stock exchanges in emerging markets;\n",
        "72. Calls on the Commission to include in future cooperation agreements with developing countries chapters on research, monitoring and help to remediate social, human and environmental problems in operations and supply chain of EU-based companies in third countries;\n",
        "73. Welcomes in principle the discussions taking place in the International Standards Organisation on creating a standard for social responsibility and calls on European representation to ensure any outcome is consistent with international standards and agreements, and with the opportunity to develop parallel methods of external assessment and certification; ° °         °\n",
        "74. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, theCommission and all institutions and organisations named within it.\n"
