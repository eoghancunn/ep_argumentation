{"speaker": "Proinsias De Rossa,", "english": "Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the PSE Group . – I too want to thank Mr Schwab, and my colleagues in other political groups as well, for the considerable amount of work they have put into this report.\nThe Ombudsman’s report, particularly the executive summary, is, I believe, an excellent example of how to present our work to the citizens. It is clear, concise and to the point. Transparency is, I believe, the key to European democracy and its main building block.\nI welcome the increased awareness of the European Ombudsman’s role, reflected in the increased numbers taking their complaints to him. I am not at all concerned about the fact that many of these are not directly his responsibility. That is a reflection of his success in bringing his office to the notice of the public and perhaps also an indication of the inadequacies of other institutions in making clear who they are and how to access them.\nI believe we should not expect citizens to find their way through the maze of EU institutions. They have more important things to be doing with their lives. When they have a complaint to make, they will reach for the nearest known vehicle available to them. I think that the citizen’s right to make a complaint is a good thing.\nThe action of the Ombudsman in referring those cases for which he does not have direct responsibility to the appropriate institution is an excellent way of dealing with such complaints. I believe it should be followed by other institutions.\nOne final point: ten years after the initiation of the Ombudsman’s statute, there is clearly a need for a review. I welcome the Ombudsman’s initiative in that regard and I look forward to debating it in Parliament in the near future.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the PSE Group . – I too want to thank Mr Schwab, and my colleagues in other political groups as well, for the considerable amount of work they have put into this report.\nThe Ombudsman’s report, particularly the executive summary, is, I believe, an excellent example of how to present our work to the citizens.
