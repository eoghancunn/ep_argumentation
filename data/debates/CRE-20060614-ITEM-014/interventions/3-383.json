{"speaker": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, and to welcome the Commissioner here.\nI too believe that the inshore fishing community is very much the backbone of our fishing community. However, after our experience with the common fisheries policy in the south-west of England we dread it extending its tentacles even further. I think we have to look at the overall take of fish – not just what has been caught inshore, but also what has been taken further out to sea – because, whether we like it or not, there is a limited number of fish and the future of inshore fishing relies greatly on adding value to the fish that is caught.\nWhen talking about inshore fishing we must also not ignore recreational fishermen and anglers, because they are very much part of the future. We really must make the most of the fish that is caught.\nFuel prices and costs are an important factor and there again we need to look to the future. We might not have electrical boats now, but we could in the future. The vessels up to 12 metres long, which is what we are referring to, are quite large vessels and capable of catching a lot of fish. So we have to be careful about the size of the nets. That is where I disagree with Mr Allister, because we have to sustain fish stocks and ensure that the larger fish are caught and the smaller ones are left to grow. If we do not face up to the fact of diminishing fish stocks, whatever policy we bring in will not create the extra fish that we all need.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, and to welcome the Commissioner here.\nI too believe that the inshore fishing community is very much the backbone of our fishing community.
