{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for the valuable remarks they have made, and I have taken note of the various points raised. I shall try to reply briefly to some of them.\nFirst of all, I agree that women should be given and should take every opportunity to establish gender parity. The Commission will do its utmost to bring this about by all available means with regard to fisheries, particularly coastal fisheries, where women are more prominent than in the other fisheries sectors.\nOn three specific points that have been made, the granting or otherwise of tie-up aid is a national matter and the reporting and control are aimed more at larger vessels than at smaller ones. Smaller vessels are in many instances either exempt, or have less stringent requirements to comply with.\nWith regard to the specificities of inshore fisheries, I need to underline again that up to a distance of 12 nautical miles these are largely subject to Member State jurisdiction. The EU is not really involved in the control of fisheries within the 12-nautical-mile limit, other than in exceptional cases. I also agree that the specificity of different coastal areas has to be taken into account. We are actually doing that in the Mediterranean proposal, and I hope that later this year I will go back to Council to try and have the Mediterranean proposal adopted.\nAs I said in my opening remarks, there is quite extensive provision for the promotion of small coastal fisheries in the European Fisheries Fund. I would also like to say that, after a long and difficult balancing act, we have finally hammered out a compromise deal allowing Coreper to agree on the European Fisheries Fund, and it will now feature as an ‘A item’ at this Monday’s Agricultural and Fisheries Council.\nTo outline how the European Fisheries Fund seeks to attain this assistance to small coastal fisheries, first of all there is a reduction of the private contribution to modernisation of vessels for owners of smaller ships to 20%. The European Fisheries Fund gives them more favourable treatment and conditions for engine replacement for vessels of up to 12 metres, in which case engines can be changed without reduction of capacity on a one-to-one basis. Member States are urged to give safety tonnage, preferably to smaller vessels.\nThe European Fisheries Fund also allows for young fishers to be offered favourable conditions for training and the purchase of a first second-hand vessel. The Fund can also be used for projects aimed at bringing about gender equality. It provides for the promotion of processing and marketing, which could be beneficial to coastal communities and fishers.\nThe Commission will carefully examine the results of the study it commissioned earlier this year when they are available, and will decide, on the basis of the findings, what measures can be proposed next year and whether there is scope for a Community initiative on coastal fisheries. Mr Ó Neachtain’s report will also be taken into account. However, my view is that we should not over-regulate in such a sector; we should help mainly by providing assistance for coastal fishers to overcome the handicaps that they face in exercising their profession.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission .
