{"speaker": "James Hugh Allister (NI). –", "english": "James Hugh Allister (NI). – Mr President, I commend the rapporteur for his hard work in drawing attention to the needs of an often neglected sector in fishing. In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, our sector is equally feeling the pressures identified in this report, and indeed a recent political decision to deprive the white fish fleet of tie-up aid, as compensation for losses inflicted by the cod recovery scheme closure has put added pressure on the inshore sector and on inshore fish and shellfish stock, because those denied tie-up aid are forced into the domain of that sector.\nHowever, UK fishermen’s experience of the common fisheries policy, whatever the Conservative Party might now say, has been so negative that, in consequence and in conscience, I could not advocate what amounts to the full extension of the common fisheries policy controls to the inshore sector. This is where I part company with the rapporteur. He thinks that the answer for the inshore sector is more Europe. I disagree, for two reasons.\nFirstly, yes, we need marketing assistance, fleet modernisation, fuel assistance, and proper recognition of the potential needs of inshore fishing, but the imposition of European harmonisation – fishing gear control, data collection, a new Community initiative – is the path, I fear, to restriction, not to growth.\nSecondly, only some countries would take up the match funding opportunities which might arise in return for EU regulation and competence. Countries like mine, the United Kingdom, would not take that up and therefore disparity in this sector across Europe would intensify, not diminish, and my inshore fishermen would have all the pain of EU regulation, with none of the gain of available assistance.\nFor those reasons I am obliged to say that I cannot support this report, although I readily acknowledge the genuine motivations the rapporteur had in bringing it forward.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Hugh Allister (NI). – Mr President, I commend the rapporteur for his hard work in drawing attention to the needs of an often neglected sector in fishing.
