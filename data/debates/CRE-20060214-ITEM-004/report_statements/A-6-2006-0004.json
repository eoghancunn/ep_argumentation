    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the European Community's general practice of incorporating human rights and democracy clauses – the so-called 'essential elements' and 'non-execution' clauses – into its international agreements since 1992;\n",
        "2.  Calls for greater transparency when implementing the democracy clause, a keystone in the EU’s external policy, and for greater involvement of the European Parliament; points out that penalties cannot be imposed in relation to the countries where human rights violations have been recorded but in relation to the violation itself;\n",
        "3.  Considers that it is the responsibility of the Union to ensure, when signing an international agreement with a third country that includes a clause on human rights, that the third country in question respects international human rights standards when the agreement is signed;\n",
        "4.  Stresses that one of the factors which have compromised the application of the clause is the generic nature of its wording, since this does not spell out detailed procedures for 'positive' and 'negative' interventions under EU/third country cooperation, leaving the Council and Member States' national imperatives to hold sway over the more general requirements of human rights;\n",
        "5.  Applauds, nonetheless, the experiment conducted to date with the democracy clause in Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreements with the ACP States, which has even led to the temporary suspension of economic and trade cooperation with some ACP States on the grounds of serious human rights violations, thus enhancing the European Union's determination and credibility; advocates the development of this experiment and its inclusion as a standard feature in EU/third country agreements;\n",
        "6.  Stresses that the political and legal content of the democracy clause is spelled out effectively in the Cotonou Agreements, and that the mechanisms for consultation and for the exchange of information, prior to the temporary suspension of bilateral cooperation, are described in detail;\n",
        "7.  Advocates the drafting of a new ‘model clause’ to correct the current wording of what is known as ‘Article 2’, to ensure a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European policy on human rights in agreements with third countries; the text should take the following principles into account: (a)  the promotion of democracy, human rights, including minority rights, the rule of law and good governance form a basic pillar of multilateral cooperation; this applies to agreements with both developing countries and industrialised countries; (b)  where the legal formulation of those rights is concerned, the parties should refer, in particular, to their international obligations and undertakings which have already been ratified, and it must be made clear that the parties are required to comply with the norms which constitute an 'essential element' of the agreement; in particular, the parties should undertake to promote those fundamental rights set out in the UN Declaration on Human Rights  of 1948, the two UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the internationally recognised UN covenants and legal norms of the \"jus cogens\"; Points out that, in its relations with third countries and in the context of promoting democratic principles and human rights through the ‘democracy clause’, the European Union is called upon to pay special attention to implementing policies for gender equality and women’s rights; Points out that, in accordance with the European treaties, in its relations with third countries and in the context of promoting democratic principles and human rights through the ‘democracy clause’ the EU also undertakes to oppose any discrimination based on sexual orientation or concerning the rights of disabled people; (c)  the parties should refer to the UN conventions binding them and to the conventions of its specialist agencies in defining the sectoral rights that cooperation should promote, in particular those of the ILO, which has created an internationally accepted legal corpus on fundamental rights; (d)  the clause should include a procedure for consultation between the parties, detailing the political and legal mechanisms to be used in the event of a request for bilateral cooperation to be suspended on the grounds of repeated and/or systematic human rights violations in breach of international law; suspension is obviously an extreme measure in EU/third country relations, and therefore a clear system of sanctions should be developed so as to offer an alternative course of action, but the accepted, essential positive approach on human rights should not exclude the possibility of a temporary suspension of cooperation having to be invoked on the grounds of a breach of the human rights and democracy clause; (e)  the clause should also include details of a mechanism to allow for the temporary suspension of a cooperation agreement as well as a \"warning mechanism\" in response to a breach of the human rights and democracy clause; (f)   the clause should be based on reciprocity, with regard both to the territory of the European Union and that of the third country;\n",
        "8.  Calls for the human rights and democracy clause to be extended to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, and including sectoral agreements, trade and technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done with the ACP States;\n",
        "9.  Calls for the expansion of the positive dimension of the human rights clause, which entails the need to take effective measures to contribute to the enjoyment of human rights within and by the respective parties, to include an ongoing assessment and monitoring of the implementation of the agreement as regards the enjoyment of human rights and to adopt a human rights approach when implementing all aspects of the agreement;\n",
        "10. Emphasises that it is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause;\n",
        "11. Considers that it must play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries, and especially in drafting their political objectives and the promotion of human rights; to that end, considers that the Commission and the Council should involve the European Parliament, through its relevant parliamentary committees, to a greater extent in drawing up the negotiating mandate for EU/third country agreements; stresses, in this regard, the necessity to improve the inter-institutional exchange of information and  to access the data base of the Commission and the Council;\n",
        "12. With regard to the need to ensure an effective mechanism for monitoring respect for human rights and democratic principles by the partners: (a)calls on the Council and the Commission to set in motion structured dialogue procedures as part of this regular assessment of the partners' compliance with their human rights obligations; considers the systematic inclusion of human rights issues on the Association Council's agendas as being part of this dialogue; (b)  recommends an enhanced role for the heads of the Commission’s external delegations in third countries; calls for ‘country-by-country multiannual strategy documents’ to be drawn up under the responsibility of delegation heads, and for the Country Strategy Papers to pay greater attention to the human rights situation, identify the priorities and spell out the means and instruments deployed by the EU to ensure respect for the democracy clause and raise the level of respect for basic rights; also calls for the wording of such strategies to be reviewed on a regular basis, particularly with the European Parliament, and to be the subject of debates in the latter’s relevant delegations and in plenary, particularly with regard to their implementation; recommends that the Commission's Country Strategy Papers and Action Plans should contain clear benchmarks for progress on human rights and a timeframe within which changes should be accomplished; (c)  if one of the governments concerned, the European Parliament orthe national parliaments concerned invokes the democracy clause to call for the suspension of a bilateral agreement or the implementation of other appropriate measures, the Association Council should automatically include that debate on its agenda; notes that the European Parliament has formally expressed its view to that effect in several cases, but that the Association Council has simply ignored those requests; (d)  recommends the establishment of a \"structured dialogue\" between the Association Council and/or its \"Sub-Committee on  Human Rights\", the European Parliament and NGOs and/or independent and democratic non-State actors in discussions relating to breaches of human rights and democracy clauses in European Union Agreements, including proposals for improving implementation of the clause (excluding none); (e)  regrets the fact that the European Parliament is not involved in the decision-making process for initiating consultation or suspending an agreement; strongly insists, therefore, on the need for it to be a joint decision-maker with the Commission and the Council in this respect, and likewise with regard to the decision to suspend any appropriate negative measures already imposed on a country ('suspension of the suspension'); (f)  proposes that an annual report be drawn up by the Commission, together with subcommittees on human rights, and debated in the European Parliament, on the application of the human rights and democracy clauses in international agreements in force, containing a case-by-case analysis of each consultation process and other appropriate measures initiated or refused by the Council that year and accompanied by detailed recommendations and an evaluation dealing with the effectiveness and coherence of the action taken;\n",
        "13. Pointing out that the Association Councils generally govern EU/third country relations, calls for the general establishment of subcommittees on human rights under association agreements, with a mandate to review compliance with, and the application and implementation of, the democracy clause, and to propose specific positive actions to improve democracy and human rights; considers that such subcommittees should meet regularly (and in any case whenever the Association Council meets), and should include and consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society; considers, in this regard, that a case-by-case policy is not the most adequate approach to be adopted with partner countries with regard to the setting-up of subcommittees on human rights and the definition of their mandate; stresses once again the need to deal with individual cases within those subcommittees;\n",
        "14. Calls for the European Parliament to be associated with the Association Councils and with the subcommittees on human rights, and for the European Parliament’s interparliamentary delegations to have an enhanced role in this connection and to invariably provide in the agendas for their visits for discussions on the clause;\n",
        "15. Emphasises that the criteria for initiating a consultation procedure or applying appropriate measures must be objective and transparent;\n",
        "16. Stresses that no measure may be lifted until the reasons for its application have ceased to exist, and calls for the introduction of additional measures if existing measures have not yielded results after a considerable period;\n",
        "17. Recognising that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause, calls for the abolition of unanimity for initiating a consultation procedure, and for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases;\n",
        "18. Points to the importance of drawing the attention of the public at large to the fact that the human rights clause is provided for in agreements between the EU and third countries;\n",
        "19. Considers that for the special case of countries with which the EU shares fundamental values and common policies for the long term, such as the countries concerned by the ‘new neighbourhood policy’, one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the ‘democracy clause’, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and/or other regional agreements;\n",
        "20. With particular regard to the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, with which the European Union maintains particularly close links through association agreements, the clause should specify that the signatories of such agreements should grant each other – on a mutual basis – the right to observe their legislative and presidential elections; calls on the Council and Commission to further encourage the countries concerned to admit international observers at the time of their elections, in the interest of transparency;\n",
        "21. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
