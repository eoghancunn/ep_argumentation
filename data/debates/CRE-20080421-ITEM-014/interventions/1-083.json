{"speaker": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE). - (HU) Thank you, Mr President. As one of those who drafted the 2009 budget, I would like to thank Jutta Haug and László Surján for their sound preparatory work. To be able to produce a good end result we had to be disciplined and harmonious in our work since we often had to explore new routes. And we can be quite confident about the environmental protection concerns in the parts of the APS (Annual Policy Strategy) that are known. I welcome all three of the Commission’s initiatives. As a member of the Central Asia Delegation, I particularly welcome the European Union’s new Central Asia Strategy and the increased support. I also welcome its intention to promote sustainable development practices in developing countries, especially in biodiversity and energy. This is not simply our moral duty. It is in our own interests. With my fellow Members, I am sure that we will be able to put forward many research projects for support, since this is what our citizens expect. Thank you very much.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE). - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
