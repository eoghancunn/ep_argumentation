{"speaker": "Margaritis Schinas (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Margaritis Schinas (PPE-DE). - (EL) Mr President, we are today inaugurating the 2009 budget, with its various special features. It is the last budget of the current parliamentary term and of the Barroso Commission. In all probability, it will be the first budget to fall between the current and new legislative frameworks. This budget will be brought in by the Lisbon Treaty, and as you know, it involves the European Parliament in many significant areas of competence.\nWhen there are many areas of competence there are also usually many responsibilities. In this context I should like to make four points about the 2009 budget. The first point is that the budget must have added community value and not merely give the impression of the end of an era. I welcome what the Commissioner said. The reinforcement of Frontex, for example, is a qualitative element showing that even in the last year of the five-year cycle of the Commission and the Parliament we can tackle new challenges.\nMy second point is that it must be a developmental budget, not one that will fund micro-programmes and modest priorities. In the prevailing atmosphere of economic crisis surrounding us, we must emphasise problems requiring developmental responses.\nThe third point is that for any new policy priority we must also have new possibilities of funding. To be plain, new targets mean new money.\nFinally, as 2009 will be a year of elections, I appeal to the Commission. When you present the preliminary draft budget to us, do so in a simple and comprehensible way. It is time for the citizens of Europe to be able to understand, easily the budget, which is about them.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margaritis Schinas (PPE-DE). - (EL) Mr President, we are today inaugurating the 2009 budget, with its various special features.
