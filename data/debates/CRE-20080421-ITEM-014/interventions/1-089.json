{"speaker": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE),", "english": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – We ought to prepare for the changes set to take place in 2009 with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the European elections as they will have a major impact on the budget. The new elected Parliament and designated Commission will indeed have to deal with new budget procedures.\nIt is therefore necessary to present for 2009 transparent and viable budgetary framework and priorities. Among other aspects, it is essential to ensure that the budget matches the priorities with sufficient resources. In this respect, I am glad to notice that our rapporteur, Mrs HAUG, puts the emphasis on the importance of the principle of solidarity as one of the cornerstones of European policies, especially with regard to cohesion and structural policies.\nWith new challenges ahead and the new inter-institutional balance within the institutional triangle it is even more essential to ensure coherence between policy priorities and the financial resources that are made available. There are growing concerns that the re-prioritization toward competitiveness, climate change or sustainable development would be made at the costs of other priorities budgets. Adding new priorities in the future should at no cost hamper the achievement of other political priorities such as solidarity.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – We ought to prepare for the changes set to take place in 2009 with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the European elections as they will have a major impact on the budget.
