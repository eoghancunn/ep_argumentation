This year is the time to demonstrate exactly what Parliament can and cannot do.\nThere is still a considerable lack of clarity over agriculture. From a careful reading of the treaty it seems that the Council can, this time, set the prices and quotas unilaterally. How does that sit with our new budgetary powers on agriculture for category II? We are supposed to have equal powers. Sorting that out has to be a priority. Food and energy policy remains important and perhaps we can resolve this within the 5% margin afforded us by the Interinstitutional Agreement. I urge the Commission to give thought to it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jan Mulder (ALDE). - (NL) Mr President, first of all I wish Jutta Haug bon courage in this important task, which she is taking on for the second time. 2008 will after all be a very important year, not only because we have to draw up the ordinary budget for 2009 – as many speakers have said – but also because we have to work out a procedure for agreeing the 2010 budget under the new treaty.
