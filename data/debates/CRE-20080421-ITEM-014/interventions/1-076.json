{"speaker": "Costas Botopoulos (PSE). -", "english": "Costas Botopoulos (PSE). - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on the Haug report, I believe, represents a first essential step towards the politicisation of the budget procedure. One way or another, 2009 will be a very full political year for Europe and our Parliament: parliamentary elections will be taking place, I hope the new Lisbon Treaty will be implemented and quite a number of changes will come into force in own Parliament. In the midst of all these developments, the budget will undergo fundamental changes. This is what is being prepared for in political terms in this report.\nLet me focus on four important points in the procedure and report. Firstly, it is important to react in good time to prepare for the new situation. The next budget, which, as we have all said, will be the first of the new procedure, must be based on foundations already laid down so that it can work correctly.\nI should like to emphasise the second point because the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has been calling for it for many years: opening up the procedure to the other committees. Here, the rapporteur’s initiative is very important. We have debated not only with the Committee on Budgets but also with the other committees about the policy priorities.\nThirdly, we must strive both now and every year to reflect the policy priorities of this Parliament according to what the budget says. Here, I believe that the primary issues are the huge subject of poverty, agriculture, development and technology.\nFourthly and lastly, and I am just finishing, Mr President, is the importance of the pilot programmes. They give us a vital glimpse at what will happen over the coming years in the EU.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Costas Botopoulos (PSE). - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on the Haug report, I believe, represents a first essential step towards the politicisation of the budget procedure.
