{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the House for this debate and Members for their comments.\nLet me make two points here. First, it is true that the cohesion policy is working, but we still need more visibility and more knowledge about its impact. We have already reinforced our communication strategy so as to enlarge the visibility of the interventions. The Commission also counts on Members of the European Parliament to help in this communications effort in your national and regional contexts, and the Commission is open to any new ideas coming from your side.\nSecondly, globalisation entails new challenges but also opportunities. Consequently, cohesion policy must be able to face the former and to seize the latter. We must ensure that our labour force is adaptable to new challenges so that economic restructuring can take place as a continuous and low-intensity process, with no negative effects accumulated in space and time.\nIn addition, we must ensure that the approach to the competitiveness of our regions takes proper account of issues like population ageing, migration flows, climate change, energy and increased commercial competition. However, we should not be too pessimistic: there are many regions in the Union which rank among the most competitive and innovative regions in the world and which are benefiting from globalisation. This has been achieved by investing in new skills, building or attracting new reservoirs of talent and encouraging networks and clusters.\nIt is by building on these successes and development strategies that the Union can mobilise all its potential and place its economy on a high-growth, sustainable path.\nOn the point concerning the importance of research and development, I would like to stress that the R&D Framework Programme has evolved over time and now incorporates specific measures for the benefit of the regions, in particular those with the weakest R&D capacities. Likewise, the importance of an integrated EU approach to innovation, mobilising a mix of instruments from R&D to cohesion policy, has been acknowledged. Cohesion policy, on the other hand, has substantially increased its investments in R&D and innovation, up to almost EUR 50 billion in 2007-2013, in order to make it possible for all EU regions to have sufficient capacity to access the framework programme on a competitive basis.\nRegarding the issue of new indicators, I wish to underline that the cohesion policy framework was fixed from 2007-2013. On 7 June 2007 Commissioner Hübner will present the fourth cohesion report in Parliament’s Regional Development Committee.\nFinally, I would like to assure you that I have taken due note of your suggestions, ideas and concerns, which will be forwarded to Commissioner Hübner, who will certainly give them her full attention.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission .
