    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Draws attention to the cohesion policy’s critical role in supporting the internal market, by means of the trade and jobs created by designing and implementing projects cofinanced by the European Union;\n",
        "2.  Emphasises the importance of developing an integrated structural policy that consistently combines support from the structural and cohesion funds with the other Community policies; calls for this concept of integrated policy to be the subject of communication and training actions so that it is recognised and used by all the actors concerned, particularly the actors on the ground;\n",
        "3.  Points out that the Commission, the Member States and the regional and local authorities should give special attention to fulfilling the objectives that have been incorporated across the board in all policies and actions in the implementation phase of the new cohesion policy, to prevent social exclusion;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Commission to investigate which national and regional public policies favour convergence and to draw up a communication on this subject, with the aim of looking into the option of linking the granting of resources under the future cohesion policy with a sound national strategic development policy, which should be defined by quantifiable indicators, so as to increase the effectiveness of the cohesion policy;\n",
        "5.  Considers that the Commission and the Member States should improve the contribution from the European Social Fund to implementation of the European Employment Strategy (EES) by strengthening the relationship between them, and that this improvement should subsequently be demonstrated using relevant indicators to promote equal opportunities;\n",
        "6.  Urges the Commission to explore new ways of combining structural policies and instruments with other Community policies and instruments designed to increase synergies for promoting competitiveness and sustainable research and innovation by drawing on the work of the Commission’s interdepartmental task forces dedicated to these fields;\n",
        "7.  Recommends to the regions and the Member States that quantified objectives for R+D+i should be established in the operating programmes;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission and Council to look into whether a requirement such as proposed in the above Aho Report to earmark at least 20 % of the structural funds for promoting R+D+i is viable and to focus not only on major projects and centres of excellence, but to also pay attention to smaller projects in less favoured regions, particularly those that contribute to sustainable regional development;\n",
        "9.  Proposes that the Commission and Council encourage the establishment of regional and local technology facilitators, using existing resources such as the Euro Info Centre and Innovation Relay Centre networks, who will be financed by the structural funds and associated with regional projects, technology parks, clusters and networks, and will invigorate innovation for businesses, particularly small businesses, by facilitating access to European aid schemes and programmes;\n",
        "10. Welcomes the preparation of the drafts for the EU’s Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter, but in this connection underlines the need for both to specify with greater clarity how to define the measures for fulfilling the objectives set out in the two strategy papers and what the Member States’ involvement should be; urges the Member States, in the context of the Leipzig Informal Council on 24-25 May 2007, to make a formal commitment to sustainable urban development;\n",
        "11. Considers that assessment of the long-term impact at the various levels of structural fund spending is essential to prepare future legislation and for sound budgetary management in this area;\n",
        "12. Proposes to the European institutions and Member States promoting good practice and measuring the impact of Community policies on cohesion on the basis of relevant indicators, by endowing the European Spatial Planning Observatory Network (ESPON) with the resources and functions needed to enable it to act as an observatory of the impact of structural policies on cohesion;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission also to verify the territorial impact of earmarking, and in particular to evaluate whether the earmarking of European funding for the Lisbon objectives is actually contributing to balanced and coherent regional development;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities, particularly those covered by the convergence objective, to give priority to measures seeking to prevent territorial imbalances and encourage integrated development and favouring the creation of polycentric areas;\n",
        "15. Urges the Commission, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities to investigate which instruments are best suited to securing a territorial balance between urban and rural areas, ensuring complementarity between rural and regional development, encouraging an integrated strategic approach to the development of urban areas together with the surrounding suburban and rural areas (‘catchment areas’) and encouraging the exchange of good practice, especially in regional and sectoral networks for improving the management of funds, including at the ‘European Regions and Cities Week’ in Brussels;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and the regions to make greater use of the structural funds so that they boost the independent, sustainable development of regions of net emigration and counteract the negative consequences of demographic change;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and the regional and local authorities to encourage the contribution of cohesion policy to the fulfilment of the new sustainable development strategy, powered largely by renewable sources of energy, that has a transport system that exploits the possibilities of intermodal combinations more efficiently, and that reuses and recycles;\n",
        "18. Suggests that the Commission, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities support and encourage economic activities in rural areas geared to the development of new technologies, especially as they do not require physical proximity to the major urban centres;\n",
        "19. Underlines the importance of territorial cooperation under the cohesion policy and calls on the management authorities to promote transnational and inter-regional cooperation by setting up separate regional and sectoral cooperation networks and the communication of experiences and good practices at regional and local level under the ‘Regions for Economic Change’ initiative;\n",
        "20. Calls for other territorial indicators to be used apart from per capita GDP for measuring the degree of cohesion, such as the rate and quality of employment, the level of disparities in GDP between neighbouring regions, the decentralisation and accessibility index, the infrastructure and transport provision, the level of research/innovation, education and training activity and the diversity of production in the area;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to deliberate on using new quantitative and qualitative indicators for cohesion together with Eurostat, in connection with the progress report on the new cohesion policy in 2009;\n",
        "22. Encourages the Commission to analyse the leverage effect of the structural funds in attracting private investment in the context of the new cohesion policy and to underline the need for cooperation between the public and private sectors;\n",
        "23. Suggests that the Commission should obtain better information on the quality and sustainability of employment created with the structural funds;\n",
        "24. Draws the Commission’s attention to the fact that the shortage of administrative capacity can be a major obstacle to maximising the impact of the cohesion policies, and therefore calls on the Commission to develop the instrument represented by tripartite contracts and  further the instrument of target-based tripartite contracts and agreements and to continue the process of administrative capacity building in the implementation phase of the new cohesion policy, including by setting up a network of accredited trainers to ensure that training measures and awareness campaigns in the management authorities of a Member State, particularly at regional and local level, are coherent;\n",
        "25. Stresses the importance of the partnership principle in the implementation of cohesion policy, that principle requiring partners to be fully informed, their positions to be noted in evaluation documents and training measures necessary for the performance of their tasks to be provided;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to consider, in the context of the implementing regulation, actions to raise the visibility of structural interventions, not only for the major infrastructure projects but also for smaller projects, and to monitor more closely the application of mandatory publicity measures and to punish the Member States concerned in the event of serious breach; calls on the management authorities to involve MEPs in providing information connected with projects financed by the structural funds;\n",
        "27. Underlines, since EU-financed projects testify to a Europe which is close and inclusive, the need for the regional authorities and the Member States to respect and comply with actions in the implementing regulation for increasing the visibility of structural interventions, and to step up their information efforts by highlighting the cohesion policy’s practical results for citizens;\n",
        "28. Considers that there is a need for ongoing studies to develop various scenarios for the future funding of EU cohesion policy; believes that, in this connection, a comparison should be made between the effects of the various main funding instruments (ERDF, ESF, the first pillar of CAP, EAFRD) on the development of the Union of 27 Member States;\n",
        "29. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the governments of the Member States, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.\n"
