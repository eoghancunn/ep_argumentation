We should secure common levels of safety and quality of health services and implementation in practice of patients’ and citizens’ rights across the EU. Patients’ rights should be part of future Community health legislation. We should recognise the two dimensions of cross-border mobility and ensure that unjustified delays for patients and healthcare professionals will be removed. Patients should have access to innovative treatments and technologies for their health. We should govern the process and create an empowering environment for it.\nLegal certainty is needed in medical practice, as is right of establishment to guarantee high-level safety and quality standards.

The Commission should introduce an initiative that observes the above-mentioned principles.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Antonyia Parvanova (ALDE). – Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Vergnaud for the wonderful cooperation we enjoyed in the preparation of this report.
