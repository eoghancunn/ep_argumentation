    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Considers that cross-border mobility of patients and health professionals will increase in future, thus giving patients more choice; considers that, whatever their level of income or place of residence, all European citizens should be guaranteed equal and affordable access to health care in due time, in accordance with the principles of universality, quality, safety, continuity, solidarity, thus contributing to the social and territorial cohesion of the Union while ensuring the financial sustainability of national health-care systems; considers that in accordance with those principles, the mobility of patients and professionals may contribute to improving accessibility and quality of health care;\n",
        "2.  Notes that the Member States do not sufficiently promote health care, as a result of which patients’ rights are restricted;\n",
        "3.  Recalls that the Member States that have implemented the existing case law of the European Court of Justice have not experienced any major increase of health-care budgets as a result of patients’ mobility;\n",
        "4.  Takes into account that the Member States may only introduce a system of prior authorisation once it has been proven that cross-border movement of patients has a negative effect on the financial balance of the national health budget; urges Member States to take note of the possibility to implement a test period during which no prior authorisation is used;\n",
        "5.  Stresses that access to cross-border care is required to achieve the free movement of citizens within the Community and helps raise employment and competitiveness levels in Member States;\n",
        "6.  Stresses the need to cut red tape connected with both the use and provision of cross-border health services;\n",
        "7.   Notes that, in order to cut the red tape relating to the use of cross-border health services, it is necessary to improve the electronic systems of patient identification and patient claims for reimbursement;\n",
        "8.  Invites the Commission to encourage the Member States to actively support the introduction of E-Health and telemedicine;\n",
        "9.   Points out that, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, the Member States retain primary responsibility for providing efficient and high quality health care to their citizens; stresses that, to this end, they should be able to use the appropriate regulatory tools, at an EU level as well as at multilateral and bilateral levels, to manage their national health-care systems and health authorities and, in exercising that power, they must always respect the provisions of the Treaties and the subsidiarity principle;\n",
        "10. Points out that the situation of legal uncertainty in which health services currently find themselves is unsatisfactory, and that Court of Justice decisions with regard to individual cases cannot suffice to formulate a policy on health services;\n",
        "11. Emphasises that Treaty rules, including the specific provisions on services of a general economic interest as well as the jurisprudence of the ECJ, apply to health services and stresses that health-service providers are fully entitled to establish and to provide services in any Member State, following national and EU rules; equally emphasises that patients are fully entitled to seek health care in any Member State;\n",
        "12. Notes that, whilst health-care systems are not within the competence of the Community, issues relating to health-care systems, such as access to medicines and treatments, patient information, and the movement of insurance companies and health professionals, have a cross-border character; notes that those issues need to be addressed by the European Union;\n",
        "13. Points out that in any case patients must be able to have equal access to appropriate treatment as close as possible to their home and in their own language; considers that Council Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988[16]on transparency should be better applied, so that medicines would be placed on the market more quickly, innovation and safety of medicines would be supported and use of the centralised procedure for marketing authorisation more strongly promoted;\n",
        "14. Stresses that Member States should treat residents of another Member State on an equal basis with regard to access to health services, regardless of whether they are private or public patients;\n",
        "15. Points out that patients should have access to information on which the health-care provider has obtained international accreditation and that the accredited providers of the health care should, regardless of where they are in the EU, ensure that health care is safe, based on measurable international indicators of quality;\n",
        "16. Maintains that any policy initiative relating to health services should, as far as possible, be the subject of parliamentary law-making rather than being pursued on an ad hoc basis through rulings of the Court of Justice;\n",
        "17.  Is of the opinion that patients’ safety and rights are not ensured in the cross-border provision of health care at present and that legal uncertainty exists regarding reimbursement mechanisms, obligations on national authorities to share regulatory information, the duty of care for both the initial and follow-up treatment and the risk management provisions for private patients;\n",
        "18. Requests a clear definition of health services; and clarification of which elements of a health-care system are relevant in this context;\n",
        "19. Notes that health-care services pursue objectives comparable to other social services of general interest in the sense that they are based on the principle of solidarity, are often embedded in national social protection systems, are person-centred, ensure that citizens can enjoy their fundamental rights and a high level of social protection, and strengthen social and territorial cohesion;\n",
        "20. Is of the opinion that any Community action relating to health-care services should be consistent with Community action relating to social services of general interest;\n",
        "21. Requests that any further clarification of concepts used in the case law of the European Court of Justice does not alter the balance struck by the European Court of Justice between Member States’ prerogatives in the field of public health and the rights of the individual patient; in this respect recalls that, as regards the concept of ‘reasonable waiting time’, the European Court of Justice has clearly indicated that it should exclusively be defined in the light of an assessment of each patient’s medical situation and that economic considerations should not play any role in that assessment;\n",
        "22. Requests a clear definition of health services, so as to clarify and clearly demarcate the scope of application of future legislation in this field;\n",
        "23. Points out that the case law of the Court is directly applicable and does not require implementing measures; points out, in particular, that the Commission should ensure that no authorisation is required for a reimbursement of the cost of non-hospital services provided in another Member State;\n",
        "24. Points out that, as regards hospital services in another Member State, the procedure for granting authorisation must provide a guarantee for patients, protecting them from arbitrary decisions taken by their national authorities; points out that, in order to facilitate the free movement of patients without prejudicing Member States’ planning objectives, in the light of the case law of the European Court of Justice, hospital treatment should be defined narrowly, as treatment which can only be provided within hospital infrastructure and may not be provided, for example, in a practitioner’s surgery or at the patient’s home; points out, in particular, that any refusal to grant an authorisation must be open to challenge in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings and that, for the purpose of assessing the medical situation of each patient, entirely objective and impartial advice from independent experts should be sought;\n",
        "25. Notes the great diversity of mobility and the different reasons for mobility among patients sent abroad by their national health system and of patients looking for medical treatment abroad of their own volition – tourists who fall ill, migrant workers, students, retired people and anyone living in an EU country other than their country of origin, or living in border regions – and stresses that those differences should be taken into account when designing policy;\n",
        "26. Stresses that it is desirable to distinguish between, on the one hand, cross-border health services, meaning those which are situated on either side of a border common to two Member States in order to maintain and offer patients a high standard of access and care, and, on the other hand, international health services within the European Union, which must offer health care for the treatment of rare or orphan diseases and/or diseases which require rare and very expensive technologies (care reference centres) or provide access to care which their Member State or State of residence cannot at present offer them;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to provide annual statistics for each Member State on patient mobility and on the number of cases of reimbursement being refused, and the reasons for such refusal;\n",
        "28. While recognising that health-care policy is primarily a Member States competence and emphasising the need for high-quality health-care provision in the country of origin of the patient, nevertheless welcomes the Commission’s initiative to launch a consultation procedure on the best form for Community action with a view to improving the access of patients, within a reasonable timeframe, to a safe, high-quality and efficient framework for cross-border aspects of health care, and calls on the Commission to come up with concrete proposals to encourage and monitor progress in this area;\n",
        "29. Notes that considerable numbers of patients from several Member States are not able to receive the necessary medical treatment in their own country within a reasonable timeframe because of the waiting lists and notes that these patients are, therefore, dependent on medical treatment abroad;\n",
        "30. Notes how difficult it is for patients to obtain clear and precise information on health care, especially in relation to cross-border health care, and the complexity of the procedures that have to be followed; notes that this difficulty, which is not only created by language barriers, potentially increases the risk to patient safety;\n",
        "31. Considers that the EU has an important role to play when it comes to improving patients’ access to information on access to cross-border health care;\n",
        "32. Notes that effective sharing and exchange of information on health, in a transparent way, is a vital requirement for ensuring consistency and maintaining a high quality of health care when using health-care services in different Member States;\n",
        "33. Considers that it is important to give patients the right to choose health care in another country when this choice allows them to receive appropriate treatment, having informed them fully of both the terms and prior conditions for access and the implications of such a choice, but is of the opinion that medical tourism should not be actively encouraged; considers that, according to the case law of the European Court of Justice, as mentioned in this report, prior authorisation for hospital care should be easily obtainable, dealt with immediately and evaluated on the basis of objective and neutral criteria; refusal ofauthorisation should be justified on the basis of objective reasons which must be verified in a transparent way and reasoned, and that any refusal should be reasoned with reference to the opinion of independent experts;\n",
        "34. Points out that Member States already have charters of patients’ rights;\n",
        "35. Acknowledges the existing differences between health-care systems in Member States and the complex legal frameworks which regulate reimbursements; calls for a codification of existing case law on the reimbursement of cross-border health care in order to ensure the proper application of the case law by all Member States, and to improve the information available to patients, national sickness insurance schemes and health-care providers without creating additional cumbersome bureaucratic burdens for Member States;\n",
        "36. Calls on the Commission to encourage all Member States to apply the existing procedures for reimbursement of cross-border health care; considers that it should be possible for the Commission to start proceedings against Member States that fail to do so;\n",
        "37. Calls for a European reference scheme to be put in place concerning reimbursement in order to allow citizens to make a comparison and to make the most suitable choice of the treatment for them;\n",
        "38. Calls for examination of ways of actively supporting and promoting the work aimed at making use of the European Health Insurance Card with a standardised set of electronic patient data common practice, in order to simplify the procedures for European citizens obtaining health care in other Member States and to ensure confidentiality of sensitive medical data; considers that the holders of the card have to decide themselves the data which will appear on it; to make the most effective use of this system, calls for the adoption of European health indicators; considers that it is crucial, for patient safety reasons, to encourage national authorities to exchange information on registration and disciplinary matters relating to health-care providers operating across borders; believes that it is appropriate to expand the European health insurance card scheme to include a system of international exchange of data concerning the insurance status of the patient;\n",
        "39. Calls on the Member States to ensure that health service providers post a clearly visible symbol demonstrating (in a similar way as with credit cards in hotels, restaurants, etc.) that a patient’s EHIC can be accepted in a given Member State, in line with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004; calls for a high level of data protection for patients as regards cross-border cooperation in health services in order to ensure confidentiality of sensitive medical data;\n",
        "40. Notes that European Parliament and Council Directive 2005/36/EC of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications[17]does not remedy all the current regulatory shortcomings at EU level concerning the free movement of health professionals, particularly with regard to continuing training and providing assurance of the current competence of health professionals; stresses that any future legislation in this field should strongly facilitate the provision of cross-border health services and the establishment of service providers from other Member States;\n",
        "41. Notes that, although mutual recognition of professional qualifications exists in Europe, there remains insufficient uniformity of quality of the content of professional training and of the ways in which professions are pursued and/or insufficient provision for such uniformity;\n",
        "42. Stresses that Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that the Union shall ensure a high level of health protection and in this regard points out that the quality of health services and the ability of the sector to retain staff are conditioned by the quality of the work and the working conditions of health-service workers, including rest times and training opportunities; points out further that accompanying measures such as quality control, supervision and the use of new information technologies should ensure the best possible medical care for the patients;\n",
        "43. Considers it very important for health-care providers directly in contact with patients to have a sufficient command of the language spoken in the host Member State concerned;\n",
        "44. Calls on the Commission to set up a system for collecting data and exchanging information between the various national authorities on health-care providers and to set up a European card to provide access to information on the skills of health-care professionals and make that information available to patients, as well as to develop a reliable health information system for service providers with an obligation on national authorities to share such information;\n",
        "45. Welcomes the work carried out by Health Professionals Crossing Borders as a good example of close multilateral cooperation between Member States’ health-care regulators;\n",
        "46. Stresses the need to better inform health-care professionals of their right of mobility within the EU by using existing tools set by the Commission, such as EURES (European Employment Services);\n",
        "47. Stresses the need to strengthen the protection of patients by requiring health professionals to take out professional indemnity insurance;\n",
        "48. Insists that patient mobility cannot be allowed to grow unchecked without concurrent and clear rules governing liability for the provision of cross-border health services and the resultant need for ease of access to redress and justice mechanisms particularly if the various stages of treatment have taken place in more than one country;\n",
        "49. Notes that the combination of current private international law rules on jurisdiction and applicable law, with various Community instruments, leads to a complex and difficult web of regimes on legal liability which does not promote ease of access to justice, which is a matter of particular concern in relation to health services and which are, by their nature, both personal and individual; moreover, a patient who seeks redress is likely to be both vulnerable and proceeding alone against either an institution or a professional body;\n",
        "50. Therefore stresses the need to guarantee the legal security of patients and professionals, calls for clarification of liabilities in the event of injury and an obligation for all health professionals to have compulsory third-party liability insurance at reasonable cost;\n",
        "51. Stresses the need to strengthen the protection of patients by requiring health professionals to take out professional indemnity insurance; notes, however, that both the means of guaranteeing that and the definition of a health professional will be determined by the relevant insurance or other financial security arrangements in each Member State;\n",
        "52. Points out that health care often requires follow-up medical checks; calls for clarification of the rules on the division of responsibilities between health-care providers during the various stages of such treatment in order to ensure continuity in care; points out that telemedicine and E-health are developing on such a scale that new rules of play need to be agreed in the areas of social protection, funding and access to such care;\n",
        "53. Stresses the need to strengthen patient protection by requiring health professionals to take out professional indemnity insurance;\n",
        "54. Considers that closer cooperation between health systems on local, regional, intergovernmental and European levels should make it possible to obtain appropriate treatment in other Member States, improve the quality of services and thus increase citizens’ confidence;\n",
        "55. Points out that cross-border cooperation between those concerned can lead to finding appropriate solutions, as shown by the example of Euroregis;\n",
        "56. Expects the Member States to pursue cross-border cooperation in offering health services, so as to be able to run their respective health systems more cost-effectively;\n",
        "57. Calls on the Commission to draw up technical standards, and calls on the governments of the Member States to actively support the introduction of interoperable transparent information systems allowing effective exchange and sharing of information on health between health-care providers in individual Member States,\n",
        "58. Encourages the development of networks of reference centres, including electronic reference centres that deal with some rare, specific and chronic diseases, and exchange of knowledge between various EU countries on best treatment practices and the organisation of health-care systems; and calls on the Commission to optimise transnational administrative cooperation;\n",
        "59. Considers that the EU can play an important role in improving the availability of information for patients on cross-border mobility, including by promoting European health indicators;\n",
        "60. Considers that the quality of health services will benefit more from exchanges of treatment methods than from unbridled patient mobility;\n",
        "61. Recognises that there is a demand for properly regulated, quality health and pharmaceuticalcross-borderservices and for cooperation and the exchange of scientific and technological experience between highly specialised medical centres; however, points out that surveys show that most people would prefer to receive high quality treatment near to where they live; considers that, in order to provide the most appropriate legislative response, the Commission should in advance conduct an exhaustive study firstly of real needs for patient mobility and secondly of the publics to which mobility can apply, while assessing the impact of such mobility on health systems;\n",
        "62. Expects (given the existing differences) the Member States to resolve issues such as access, quality of care and the control of costs among themselves;\n",
        "63. Believes that the open method of coordination is one of the appropriate instruments by which to organise closer cooperation among Member States;\n",
        "64. Hopes that bilateral or multilateral agreements between Member States, regions and local authorities and between the players in the health-care sector will develop, which would stimulate sharing of material and human resources in cross-border areas, and in particular in areas with high numbers of short-term visitors, and exchanges of skills and knowledge;\n",
        "65. Calls for the creation and use of a single point of contact on the basis of existing Community instruments, in accordance with the specificity of the organisation of each health-care system, to guarantee access to objective and independent information for patients, health professionals, health-care institutions and the competent authorities; considers that health professionals can assist patients in seeking this information;\n",
        "66. Encourages the Commission to make use of all existing instruments, such as SOLVIT and infringement procedures, in order to assist patients who have been refused reimbursement (for non-hospital care) or authorisation (for hospital care) even though the conditions laid down in the case law have been fulfilled;\n",
        "67. Encourages the Commission to continue collecting data from the Member States and to further analyse trends and challenges facing cross-border mobility of patients and health professionals;\n",
        "68. Considers that the Treaties and the case law of the European Court of Justice are clear when it comes to the rights and obligations of patients and health professionals with regard to cross-border services;\n",
        "69. Calls on the Commission to strengthen its policy of pursuing violations of EU law with a view to ensuring that all Member States comply with the case law of the European Court of Justice and that all European patients, irrespective of their country of origin, benefit from the rights conferred on them by the Treaty;\n",
        "70. Invites the Commission to submit to the Parliament and to the Council a proposal for an appropriate instrument with a view, in particular, to codifying the case law of the European Court of Justice;\n",
        "71. Invites the Commission to submit, to Parliament, a proposal to reintroduce health services into Directive 2006/123/EC, and a proposal to codify European Court of Justice rulings on European patients’ rights;\n",
        "72. Believes that, above all, a new European regulatory framework for cross-border health care should improve access to high-quality health care in the event of illness, contribute to patient safety and increase the choices open to all patients in the European Union without contributing to inequality in health-care outcomes;\n",
        "73. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
