    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Stresses that the territorial concentration of vulnerable communities and groups and the  social exclusion affecting  the most underdeveloped regions is an increasing challenge to cohesion in the EU; emphasises, moreover, that this phenomenon is not only inter-regional in underdeveloped areas but also intra-regional, to a significant extent, in both developing and developed areas, and requires particular attention because such vulnerable communities and groups tend to lose visibility within a more general, favourable picture;\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Member States to determine the criteria defining vulnerable communities and groups in order to better identify the problems they face and to facilitate targeted and systematic measures;\n",
        "3. Considers that the territorial dimension of social exclusion should be dealt with in the context of territorial cohesion policy;\n",
        "4.  Emphasises in this connection that  individual actions alone are not sufficient to overcome the  territorial problems of social exclusion and recommends therefore that the Member States apply a holistic territorial development strategy, carrying out an equalizing policy, putting the cross-sector integrated approach into practice and focusing on the potential of  all EU territories;\n",
        "5.  Points to the need to address through an integrated approach the shortcomings in terms of equal opportunities and the potential concentration of social conflicts in underdeveloped areas;\n",
        "6.  Notes, in this regard, that vulnerable groups may exist in all regions, even the more prosperous ones, and that an integrated approach should take such groups into account;\n",
        "7.  Points out that impoverishment and exclusion are not unique to urban areas but also affect rural areas, even though they may assume specific forms in those areas, particularly on account of the fact that, in rural areas, social exclusion is compounded by territorial exclusion and since the exclusion of those areas from economic development means that all the social groups living there are affected;\n",
        "8.  Stresses the importance, in the framework of an integrated approach, to make the development of a healthy environment at Community, Member State and regional levels a priority in order to achieve the aims of cohesion policy, such as fighting poverty, the sound health of citizens and a better quality of life in all regions, which are crucial to long-term development and social, economic and territorial cohesion in the EU;\n",
        "9.  Emphasises the importance of involving regional and local authorities as well as the economic and social partners and relevant NGOs in the planning and implementation of integrated development strategies and the importance of supporting bottom-up initiatives;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to allocate resources between developed cities and  isolated territories, including rural areas, in a way that is adapted to their specific needs and to establish tailor-made long-term programmes for specific vulnerable communities and groups, with the participation of local authorities, relevant social and economic partners and representatives of the  relevant population groups in the decision-making process and in the implementation of such programmes in order to best address their needs and bring about genuine solutions to overcome exclusion and its consequences ;\n",
        "11. Calls for the continuance of income-generating activities in rural areas, for which purpose particular attention should be devoted to family farming and to small and medium-sized farmers, with the CAP being revised in order to make it fairer, as well as to non-agricultural entrepreneurial activities which supply goods and services that are essential to maintaining the population and welcoming new arrivals;\n",
        "12. Stresses the importance of agricultural and non-agricultural economic activities (such as processing and direct marketing of agricultural products, tourism, services, small and medium-sized industries) in rural areas in providing employment, preventing poverty and stemming the rural exodus; calls, therefore, for improved facilities for further vocational training in rural areas to support the development of businesses;\n",
        "13. Urges the Commission and the Member States to make greater use of the synergies and complementarities of the various financial instruments available, such as the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Integration Fund, the programme of Community action on public health and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, in order to increase their added value;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission to present, in the framework of the forthcoming Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion, an objective for and a clear  definition of territorial cohesion, the criteria determining it, its instruments and  the means available for achieving territorial targets;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to  produce comparable micro-regional statistical data , with special regard to social indicators, such as the Human Development Index established by the United Nations, in order to address with appropriate measures the situation in  the areas where the most vulnerable communities and groups live and the problems they face;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission in this connection to carefully examine the extent to which  new quantifiable development  indicators in addition to  GDP per capita, such as social indicators, should also be used in order to identify the most vulnerable communities and groups and their location, reveal  disparities between and within regions, evaluate implementation and policy efficiency and be used as guidance for development planning;\n",
        "17. Urges the Commission to examine, in the framework of the Green Paper on territorial cohesion, whether the NUTS  4 level  would be appropriate for pursing a differentiated policy to achieve the objective of territorial cohesion;\n",
        "18. Emphasises the need to address the demographic trends of further urban concentration and rural exodus and their territorial impact; calls therefore on the Member States to draw up strategies to revitalise vulnerable  areas by developing infrastructure, fostering real development opportunities in accordance with their specific potentials, maintaining services of general interest through enhanced local administrative capacities and the decentralisation of the public sector, offering appropriate  training and employment opportunities, improving housing and living conditions and increasing the attractiveness of those areas to investors; considers that, at the same time, towns need support for their efforts to remedy urban difficulties;\n",
        "19. Considers that, although rural exodus acted in the past as a safety valve for farmers excluded from their original activity, this is no longer the case, since unemployment is now seriously affecting the unskilled and thus the industrial units established in rural areas are among the first victims of restructuring and relocation operations, which have the effect of reducing the scope for the multiple activities upon which small farmers in difficulty used to be able to rely in order to supplement their income from farming, thus driving them even more rapidly into penury;\n",
        "20. Stresses that not only structural policies should be retained after 2013, but that the budgetary review should be used as an opportunity to ensure that the necessary resources are made available in order to guarantee economic, social and territorial cohesion among regions and countries in the EU in the future;\n",
        "21. Recommends that political measures taken to tackle social exclusion and make vulnerable communities and groups more active should include the element of voluntariness;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission to present a specific proposal addressing in a realistic and specific manner the problems faced by vulnerable communities and groups, including social exclusion;\n",
        "23. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
