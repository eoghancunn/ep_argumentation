There is a growing voice calling for account to be taken of the difficult prospects facing districts or areas whose population has been on the periphery of decision–making and of mainstream economic development.\nFrom my own constituency I know the difficulties facing not only disadvantaged urban areas, but also peripheral areas in the border counties of Ireland. These rural areas frequently face difficulties in securing investment in business or infrastructure. The ending of the “rural exodus” mentioned in this report should be a priority for politicians.\nThe role of those farming on small– and medium–sized farms in sustaining rural communities is correctly spelt out by Mr. Harangozó. Rural communities should not be demoted in the cohesion policy and a greater interlink between rural development and regional development in fighting social exclusion must be implemented.\nRemoteness from communication and transport networks is a practical problem which must be tackled.", "lang": "GA", "original": "Bairbre de Brún (GUE/NGL), in writing. – (GA) I would like to welcome this report by Mr. Harangozó on the impact of the cohesion policy on the integration of vulnerable communities and groups.
