{"speaker": "László Kovács,", "english": "László Kovács, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I am really pleased that the Members of Parliament who took the floor basically agreed with the Commission White Paper. They not only shared its views, but also expressed support for the Commission’s initiatives.\nI appreciate the complex approach of the speakers. This is fully in compliance with the complex nature of the problem of obesity. Many of the speakers urge raising public awareness and cooperation with the food industry, which is also fully in line with the text of the White Paper both in spirit and letter. The Commission’s commitment is reflected in the proposal on food information to consumers which we will soon be discussing with the Parliament and also with the Council.\nI want to stress that there are various programmes and projects in the European Union which mutually reinforce the White Paper on nutrition, overweight and obesity – such as the Green Paper on urban mobility or the White Paper on sport, both aimed at a healthier lifestyle and a healthier environment. Others include the common agricultural policy health check – which would, for example, decrease consumption aid for butter – or the schemes for school milk and fruit, the Community legislation on advertising and marketing to promote responsible advertising, or the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices.\nThese are very important initiatives in full harmony with the Commission’s position. The Commission will continue to work with the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health and with the high-level group of Member State experts.\nI also want to stress that the Commission is encouraging initiatives that help prevent the development of cardiovascular disease in Europe, for which trans-fatty-acid consumption is a risk factor in addition to overall fat intake and the intake of saturated-fat acids. Voluntary reformulation can deliver results. Commitments have been made within the European Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health to reformulate products and reduce the amount of trans-fats and saturated fats in them.\nThere is just one more issue which I want to mention because it touches my portfolio – taxation. There was a proposal to examine the possibility of applying reduced VAT rates for vegetables and fruits. I do feel sympathy with this proposal because it shows exactly how tax policy can promote the attainment of other important policy purposes.\nTo conclude, I want to underline that Parliament is one of the founding members of the Platform, and the European Commission is prepared to regularly update Parliament on the activities of the Platform. Parliament is expected to discuss the monitoring report in 2010.", "lang": "EN", "original": "László Kovács, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I am really pleased that the Members of Parliament who took the floor basically agreed with the Commission White Paper.
