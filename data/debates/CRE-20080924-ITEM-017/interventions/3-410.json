{"speaker": "Siiri Oviir (ALDE). -", "english": "Siiri Oviir (ALDE). - (ET) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of people who are overweight and obese has been discussed here several times already but, according to the experts, a further 1.3 million people will join their ranks next year. This is the equivalent of the entire population of my homeland, Estonia, a terrifying thought. There are many factors behind poor diet and obesity, although doubtless we must take the cost, availability and awareness of food into account in our assessment.\nSixteen European Union countries have kept VAT on food below the standard rate, a laudable decision. The proposal included in the report to reduce VAT on fruit and vegetables to below five per cent is welcome. The WHO health report refers to a low intake of fruit and vegetables as one of seven health risks. In that context it would be commendable to start providing fruit in schools, and European Union support would be necessary if we are to introduce the measure in all 27 Member States.\nOne cannot say much in one minute but I would like to add a couple of words on advertising and the media. Their help and ideas are needed to advertise carrots, not Pepsi-Cola, and on the kinds of stereotypes and body images to advertise, as these play a very important role in raising people’s awareness. Allow me, as I finish, to thank the Committee and the rapporteur for their efforts.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Siiri Oviir (ALDE). - (ET) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of people who are overweight and obese has been discussed here several times already but, according to the experts, a further 1.3 million people will join their ranks next year.
