Of course there are objections relating to insufficient funding and generally about the quality of food which is actually on the plate, but it helps children – especially from the poorest families – to have proper and decent-quality meals.\nI also welcome an initiative to distribute fruit and vegetables free in schools. It should be considered as an example of best practice. I believe EU funding could be helpful in assisting Member States with the financial burden. The importance of this is that such projects take the EU directly to citizens.\nLast but certainly not least, the report fails to mention consumption in the sense of over-consumption. These days, changing consumption patterns equal a change in our lifestyles. It is perhaps hard to imagine a parallel between obesity and climate change but, indeed, such dependency exists. If we started to think about both topics at the same time, perhaps we would fly fewer of our apples and strawberries from abroad and grow more of them at home, selling them at local food markets instead of supermarkets – which is exactly one of the points that the current report proposes.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Justas Vincas Paleckis (PSE). - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for successfully tackling such an oversized topic.\nFirstly, I should stress the importance of providing free lunches for schoolchildren, which is the practice in my home country of Lithuania but is far from that of all Member States.
