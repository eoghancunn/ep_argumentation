{"speaker": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). -", "english": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur: this report is very timely and deserves the full attention of policymakers. The facts on obesity are startling and have already been quoted. Yesterday at a major conference in Dublin a nutrition expert claimed that Ireland was on the cusp of an obesity crisis, and, indeed, a similar situation pertains across Europe.\nI want to briefly mention just one issue: self-regulation versus legislation. We have a voluntary code for the advertising of food of poor nutritional value to children, but there is a large question mark over whether this is working or not. According to the Irish Heart Alliance, this voluntary code is not effective. I believe we need to monitor it very carefully and take immediate action if necessary.\nMr Bushill-Matthews mentioned personal responsibility. That is fine at one level, but we need clear, understandable food labelling – colour coding is a positive step. We live in a world where we consume greater and greater amounts of processed foods. Indeed, certain EU policies promote this – the Lisbon Agenda: more people at work, less time for food preparation. I fully support the Lisbon Agenda, but, alongside that, we as EU policymakers have a duty to ensure that food manufacturers make it very clear what is contained in the processed foods they manufacture.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur: this report is very timely and deserves the full attention of policymakers.
