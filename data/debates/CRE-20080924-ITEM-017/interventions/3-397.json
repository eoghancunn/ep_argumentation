{"speaker": "Irena Belohorská (NI). -", "english": "Irena Belohorská (NI). - (SK) The deteriorating trend towards unhealthy eating and insufficient physical exercise in Europe is alarming. I am therefore very pleased that we are looking at this problem here in the European Parliament.\nWe know that obesity is one of the factors responsible for ‘civilisation diseases’, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and consequent diseases of the musculoskeletal system. On 17 September I organised a working lunch here in the European Parliament devoted to the problem of the relationship between obesity and diabetes in pregnancy. The Members and assistants present were able to listen to the top experts in Europe, such as Dr Rosa Corcoy Pla, chair of the working group for diabetes in pregnancy, and Professor F. Andre Van Assche, former President of the European Association of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians and Professor Dr Pera Ovesena.\nObesity and maternal diabetes represent an increased risk of maternal and also neonatal morbidity and mortality. We must realise that this involves not just disease in the mother, someone who often may not follow a proper diet, but also responsibility for the healthy development of the future population.\nAn obese diabetic mother will have obese children, and so it goes on from generation to generation. I should therefore like to draw your attention to the written declaration I and my colleagues have prepared on this problem, the relationship between diabetes and obesity in pregnancy. The EU Member States should devote more attention to preventing and screening for diabetes in pregnancy and make the population more aware of the risk and consequences of obesity.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Irena Belohorská (NI). - (SK) The deteriorating trend towards unhealthy eating and insufficient physical exercise in Europe is alarming.
