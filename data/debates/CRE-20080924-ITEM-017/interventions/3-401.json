{"speaker": "Roberta Angelilli (UEN). -", "english": "Roberta Angelilli (UEN). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur on her excellent work. I am obviously about to repeat many of the remarks already made by my colleagues, but I do not think that we should mince our words: obesity affects approximately 25% of European children and is therefore a serious threat to their future health. The causes include inadequate information, poor eating habits, a lack of physical activity and even a shortage of sports facilities. Nor should we underestimate the social and psychological problems involved, partly because overweight children are often victims of bullying.\nI believe, for this reason, that the proposed increase in funding for the school fruit programme, whereby fruit and vegetables are made available free of charge in the classroom, is a good idea. Indeed, 2009 should see a revival of the Mediterranean diet and the production of fruit and vegetables, especially in view of the latest WHO data indicating that the consumption of these foods is falling even in Mediterranean countries. Under this initiative, rather than being destroyed to keep prices high, fruit will be used to ensure a healthier diet, especially for our children, and therefore a healthier future for Europe's citizens.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Roberta Angelilli (UEN). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur on her excellent work.
