{"speaker": "Zbigniew Zaleski (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Zbigniew Zaleski (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, we are today dealing with two food-related disorders. One of these is anorexia, which generally has a psychological basis linked to the fact that thin bodies tend to be presented as more attractive. We are all aware of extreme cases in which this disorder has resulted in death. Fortunately, however, fashion is changing and the disorder is now less widespread. The other disorder is obesity, which can also have a psychological basis. Food can be perceived as a way of coping with stress and as an escape from life’s problems. Against this background, I believe that the key issue is nutrition. Food producers and distributors bear a much greater share of the blame in this respect. The report before us is very welcome and should serve as a warning. The so-called fast food provided for school pupils on outings and trips is a danger. After all, it amounts to a lesson on eating. Appropriate education and food control are needed. In my view, our efforts represent a step in the right direction and I therefore support this report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zbigniew Zaleski (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, we are today dealing with two food-related disorders.
