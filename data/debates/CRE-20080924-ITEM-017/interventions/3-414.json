The whole world, not just Europe, is currently facing a tremendous challenge involving obesity and the diseases directly and indirectly related to it. Expenditure on their treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. Sixty per cent of the population of the United States is overweight, and one third now suffers from obesity. The most recent data from that country indicates that expenditure on the aforementioned conditions is in excess of USD 100 billion. This is more than 10% of the healthcare budget. Europe is slowly catching up with its neighbours as regards these infamous statistics. More and more children and young people are suffering from hypertension and diabetes. These conditions are often due to poor nutrition and lack of exercise. In the interests of the future of Europe and of its inhabitants, we must pay more attention to the problems raised in the report by Mr Foglietta. The health disaster threatening Europe and the entire globalised world can only be avoided by swift, determined and joint action.\nThe European Parliament is currently dealing with many issues relating to economic and social matters. If we are to carry them through successfully, though, we must not forget that only healthy societies are able to derive full benefit from the advantages made available to them. Action to promote a healthy lifestyle must be taken. At the same time, however, it is necessary to introduce legal measures which make every Member State responsible for making more determined efforts to improve the physical condition of its citizens through healthy eating and sport. It should of course be borne in mind that the specific actions and policies to combat this phenomenon fall within the competence of the Member States.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bogusław Sonik (PPE-DE). - (PL) Mr President, the subject of the health issues related to nutrition, overweight and obesity is a matter of current concern and it is right that we should be dealing with it now.
