{"speaker": "Antonio De Blasio (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Antonio De Blasio (PPE-DE). - (HU) Thank you, Mr President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, obesity and being overweight are not only fed by health reasons, but by social reasons in the broadest sense. I was delighted to see that the White Paper and report point out that the question of obesity and being overweight must not be examined at the stage when it has already grown into a real health problem, but we must reach back to the root causes.\nI consider it important to emphasise that the White Paper and the Parliament’s opinion must not address the health sector but citizens and communities; society, in other words. This extremely important question must be handled in harmony with the European Union’s other documents, since the causes of the problem are multi-faceted so the solution must come from many different directions, and yet be coordinated, in order to succeed.\nMaking a healthy lifestyle more popular must be supported in every possible way, at European Union, Member State, regional and local level. We must place particularly great emphasis on the programmes and actions that aim to bring school-age children and young people up with a healthy lifestyle. Here I must stress the role of local governments, since it is mainly they that run schools. Programmes that work well must be publicised widely.\nWe all know that the role of the media in formulating knowledge is gaining ever more ground: the power of advertising can conjure healthy eating, sport, regular exercise, basically a healthy lifestyle, into a fashionable model to follow. In preventing obesity, the importance of exercise and sport must be closely linked to the requirements of healthy eating, but it is not at all sufficient to focus on only these two aspects: encouraging people to lead a healthy lifestyle must become top priority in all relevant policy areas.\nThe aim is for people to understand that healthy, balanced eating does not mean that we can never consume certain foods. Regular exercise does not mean that we have to take exercise in every free minute. The emphasis is on moderation, and in this way our diets and lives will become more balanced. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, and you for listening. Thank you very much.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Antonio De Blasio (PPE-DE). - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
