{"speaker": "Horst Schnellhardt (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Horst Schnellhardt (PPE-DE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the White Paper, the Commission intends to present an integrated strategy for the EU which aims to reduce diseases related to poor nutrition and the overweight and obesity-related health issues with which it is associated. That is right and proper, for the increase in diseases related to poor nutrition and lack of exercise forces us to act.\nThe Commission's aim of adopting an integrated approach across government policy areas is the right one. This is the only way to tackle the causes of obesity-related diseases. A balanced diet is important, as are nutritional education and promoting sports in schools, and it is important that we provide guidance and support so that people in the European Union can move in this direction. Various positive initiatives have already been launched. The EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health is one of them, and supports this objective. It is a Europe-wide initiative which attempts to encourage citizens to make the necessary changes. The Commission's school fruit programme is another example.\nHowever, if we resort to populist demands again, as advocated in the proposal, we will simply distract attention from the real problem. What is the point of demanding, yet again, a restriction on advertising? We have only just adopted the Television without Frontiers Directive. It contains very clear rules, and yet here we are coming up with new ideas and demands again.\nI lived for 40 years in an area of Europe where advertising was banned. The result was not that we all slimmed down in the communist part of Europe. What are the Greens doing, calling for taxes on foods with a particular type of nutritional content? Do we want the poor in the European Union to be unable to eat certain types of food because they can no longer afford them? Which strategy, then, do we want to adopt?\nThe strategy that we should be adopting starts with education and training. That is where we should be investing. We should not be restricting our citizens' freedom of choice with punitive measures or restricting their access to food.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Horst Schnellhardt (PPE-DE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the White Paper, the Commission intends to present an integrated strategy for the EU which aims to reduce diseases related to poor nutrition and the overweight and obesity-related health issues with which it is associated.
