These include the production of healthy food, sensible nutrition, improving the financial situation of the poorest people, raising awareness in society, developing research, monitoring children’s diet, leading a healthy lifestyle and promoting active leisure time. Unfortunately, in addition to the generally recognised causes of obesity and overweight there are contributory factors linked to irresponsibility and the desire to make a profit. A good example of this is the spread of genetically modified organisms. Planting and cultivating the latter is detrimental to biodiversity and takes the place of healthy food.\nIn the interests of human welfare, development and health, we should take concerted action to make Europe GMO-free.
