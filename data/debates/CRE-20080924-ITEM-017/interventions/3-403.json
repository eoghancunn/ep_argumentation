{"speaker": "Urszula Krupa (IND/DEM). -", "english": "Urszula Krupa (IND/DEM). - (PL) Mr President, the text on the health issues related to nutrition, obesity and overweight contains many important observations. There are alarming indicators showing how common being overweight has become. Accordingly, it is essential to combat this by paying particular attention to the promotion of organic food, sport and physical exercise from an early age. It is also important to raise awareness of harmful adverts that deliberately encourage overeating.

These include trauma and psychological conditions, which play an important role. A range of psychological disorders lead to irrational eating disorders. Anorexia and bulimia are obvious examples of this. Biological responses created by the general availability of fast food can be much stronger than usual when there is inadequate personal development, a lack of respect for values, widespread depression and nervous conditions. Contempt for ethical and moral principles and disregard of the meaning of fasting can even stunt personal development by making a person dependent on his or her blood sugar level and on visual and taste sensations.\nIt is surprising that there has been no mention of the significance of saturated fatty acids in the e-mail discussions and in the amendments tabled.
