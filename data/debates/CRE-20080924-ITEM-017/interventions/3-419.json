We should promote feeding education both in primary school and after. All the Member States should include in their school curricula the basics of a balanced diet and exercise.\nAccording to certain statistics, in ten years’ time there will be over 30 million overweight children in Europe. I am deeply worried about this major problem. Consequently, I started a series of written statements proposing the creation of special programs in schools, including free regular health check-ups and counselling. I endorse the proposals in the White Paper, such as the appropriate labelling of foods, restrictions on advertising in the case of products that are harmful to children, decreased VAT on fruit and vegetables, and foods for children only. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for this accomplishment.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Zlotea (PPE-DE). - (RO) I believe we should focus our attention on overweight children and that we should try to create new programs for fighting obesity in early life, when we acquire our feeding habits.
