This is why excess weight and obesity should concern us; therefore, I welcome the Commission's White Paper, as well as Mr. Foglietta's report.\nUnfortunately, obesity affects mainly people from disadvantaged categories, all the more so as the price of staple foods has risen considerably; however, promoting a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating could prevent obesity and lead to a decrease in the number of obese persons, at the same time cutting costs in the health system by eliminating the need to treat all the complications related to obesity.\nI, too, believe that coercive measures are not a solution. European citizens have the freedom of choice. The solution is better nutritional information, with appropriate labels specifying the contents, as well as information campaigns funded by the European Commission and the governments of Member States. We should not forget campaigns targeted at parents, who have a very important role, and at children. Moreover, Member States should supervise the content of vending machines placed in schools, they should monitor the food provided by schools and kindergartens, and they should encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables. Physical education classes are also very important. Not last, the Commission should pay particular attention to industry initiatives concerning responsible advertising and the reduction of salt, sugar and fats.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Cristian Silviu Buşoi (ALDE). - (RO) We have all heard the statistics concerning obese children and adults, so there would be no point in repeating them.
