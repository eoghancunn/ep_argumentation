{"speaker": "Piia-Noora Kauppi,", "english": "Piia-Noora Kauppi, Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . − Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission communication, as well as the report of Mr Lehtinen as both are overall very balanced pieces of work.\nMoreover, they rightly bring out an important notion that must be addressed at EU level – consumer policy is and must be part of the internal market.\nThis leads me to what the Committee on Economic Affairs has rightly brought into the report: completing the internal market is in itself great consumer policy. EU-wide competition brings prices down and increases quality and consumer choice. The EU-wide access to consumers to these choices must be asserted.\nIn an internal market, consumers are drivers of the market economy and can, through their choices, protect their own interests. Therefore, the consistent implementation of existing directives regarding the internal market is of paramount importance.\nThe Committee on Economic Affairs’ opinion correctly highlights two areas that are of particular importance in this respect. First, financial services: a real internal market in banking, loans, insurance etc. is needed to empower European consumers. This is especially pressing as democratic developments are making best possible investment services increasingly relevant to all. Big hurdles remain to be overcome here.\nSecond, e-commerce. This is linked to functioning financial markets and conditioned by the development of payment systems, but it is also important to practically all aspects of the internal market as the internet offers a real European marketplace. So we must make sure that European e-commerce really functions and consumers have right choices there.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Piia-Noora Kauppi, Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . − Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission communication, as well as the report of Mr Lehtinen as both are overall very balanced pieces of work.\nMoreover, they rightly bring out an important notion that must be addressed at EU level – consumer policy is and must be part of the internal market.\nThis leads me to what the Committee on Economic Affairs has rightly brought into the report: completing the internal market is in itself great consumer policy.
