{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). –", "english": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). – Madam President, Commissioner, my congratulations to Mrs Jackson on an excellent, though in some aspects controversial, report, and also to Mr Florenz and Mr Blokland. Waste, as we all know, is a major problem of modern day living, and it is greatly worsened by the exaggerated consumerism-based global society we live in. Hence, the most important task is not to find out how best to cope with the waste we generate, but to try to reduce the waste we produce in the first place. However, things being as they are, we have to deal with an effective waste framework directive.\nTime constraints preclude extensive individual debate. I shall just mention two points. The first is the much-discussed Article 3, and I will say straightaway that I tend to favour the amendment by Mrs Jackson and Mr Florenz regarding the recycling definition, not because I approve of incineration as such but because I believe it is vital to take one step at a time, and it is important to keep the existing recycling industry alive and functioning.\nMy second point concerns implementation and monitoring. We all know that many directives are comprehensive enough but, to a large extent, remain good only on paper. We must make sure that the application of this waste directive is effectively monitored and properly implemented in practice. Let us remember that a good piece of legislation from our Parliament, if improperly applied on the ground, is a bad piece of legislation for our citizens.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). – Madam President, Commissioner, my congratulations to Mrs Jackson on an excellent, though in some aspects controversial, report, and also to Mr Florenz and Mr Blokland.
