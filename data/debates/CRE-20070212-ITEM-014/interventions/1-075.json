{"speaker": "Stavros Dimas,", "english": "Stavros Dimas, Μember of the Commission. (EL) Madam President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteurs Mrs Jackson and Mr Blokland for their exceptional reports and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and Mrs Gutiérrez and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the opinion which it drafted at first reading.\nWaste policies play a fundamental role in reducing the environmental impact of the use of natural resources. The primary aims of the thematic strategy and the draft directive are to prevent waste generation and, insofar as it cannot be prevented, to minimise the effects on the environment and public health.\nOver the last thirty years, the European Union has developed important waste policies and legislation in the aim of protecting public health and the environment.\nThe Commission's aim in the recent review of the directive on waste is to bring the legislative framework into line with current environmental challenges. The updated policy takes account of the progress made in the field of ecological innovation and supports our state-of-the-art knowledge of the sustainable use of natural resources. The proposed package of measures is designed to:\n- firstly, reduce the environmental impact of waste during its entire life cycle;\n- secondly, make the prevention of waste generation a priority. This effort requires action at national, regional and local level. The Member States must apply waste generation prevention policies through mandatory national programmes. This is expected to help reverse the current trend towards increased quantities of waste. Similarly, targets at national level will help to reduce the quantities of waste at Community level;\n- thirdly, promote recycling by setting standards which safeguard the quality of recyclable materials. This will foster confidence in recycled materials and increase the demand for them on the internal market. We propose that this should be done using criteria to determine when recovered waste loses its status as waste;\n- fourthly, the proposed measures even aim to modernise and simplify legislation on waste. Certain definitions are clarified which in the past were a source of difficulty and contradictory interpretation. The aim of the strategy and the directive is to achieve a balance, to maintain what has proven to work over the last 30 years and, at the same time, to modernise the legislative framework for coming decades.\nTo close, I should like to make two important comments on the framework directive on waste:\n- firstly, the text which emerges from the codecision procedure needs to be clear and to provide security of law. Some of the amendments tabled do not safeguard this legal clarity, especially those concerning the distinction between recovery and disposal;\n- secondly, if the legislative act in question is to be environmentally effective, it must retain its character as a framework directive. In other words, it must be a stable and clear legal framework which, at the same time, will provide adequate flexibility, so that it can adapt to changing needs.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stavros Dimas, Μember of the Commission.
