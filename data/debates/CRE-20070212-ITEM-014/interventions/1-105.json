To do otherwise would undermine the principle of prevention, reuse and recycling. However, this should not blind us to the fact that dioxins are produced from many other sources, from barbecues to fireworks to open fires.\nFinally, with regard to illegal cross-border dumping of rubbish in Ireland, lest anyone in Parliament be misled, let me say to my colleague, Mr Allister: it goes both ways. Illegal waste dumping knows no borders and it is most certainly not one-way traffic; greater vigilance is needed on both sides of the border.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, in the one minute allocated to me I shall make four brief points.\nFirstly, I support the five-stage hierarchy of waste, but flexibility should only be on a case-by-case basis, otherwise we run the risk that this approach may mean everything and nothing at the same time.\nSecondly, I agree with the rapporteur that we should only use the comitology process for technical purposes and that we should move to codecision processes in Articles 5, 11 and 21.\nThirdly, I believe that waste incineration should not be reclassified as a recovery operation but remain as a disposal operation.
