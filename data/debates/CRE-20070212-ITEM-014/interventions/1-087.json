{"speaker": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I agree with Mrs Jackson that her five-step waste hierarchy sends out clear signals to Member States on waste prevention and management legislation, and that she has allowed enough wriggle room so that the environment will always be the winner in waste policy and that Member States take full account of the principles of the precautionary approach and sustainability, together with other criteria covering the ecological, economic and social impacts, when applying the five-step waste hierarchy in a carbon-efficient way.\nI believe that recovery needs to be unambiguously defined, although there may still be further fine tuning needed after we vote tomorrow, and that the energy efficiency criteria (which should be in the annex) to determine whether municipal waste incinerators should be classified as recovery or disposal operations are a realistic and logical contribution to Europe’s waste and energy challenges.\nI agree that it is of critical importance for the environment and for human health that municipal waste incinerators conform to gold standards and use best available technology. The debate is ongoing as to whether the efficiency criteria should be included or not, and at what levels they should be set. Waste is a resource and an energy source, and we must not exclude ways to use it as such after the five-step hierarchy.\nThe wording of the Commission text and that of the latest PPE-DE Group amendment referred to energy efficiency criteria as being ‘equal to or above’ the stated levels. This amendment will ensure that we will not prejudice further legislation or future legislation, such as a potential waste incineration directive, making criteria even stricter if needs be.
