{"speaker": "Thomas Wise (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Thomas Wise (IND/DEM). – Mr President, here we see one of the few cases where this Parliament is asked for real legislative input as part of a codecision procedure.

However, at least it gives me the chance to point out the difference between UKIP and British Conservatives. As a UKIP MEP, I can stand up for my country even when I have to disagree with a group colleague to do so. I believe my own country is capable and responsible in matters of waste and should be free to enforce its own legislation. The British Tories are not free to criticise EU enthusiasts within their own group, the EPP – the group their leader promised to leave. That is bad enough. But, worse still, they even write the EPP’s Europhile reports for them. Witness Mrs Jackson when she says you must absolutely resist the Member States and the Commission in their efforts to keep the comitology process closed. Naturally, I am with her as far as the Commission goes, but the Member States? A British Tory talking about resolutely resisting the Member States? This is the true face of British Conservatives. Mrs Jackson’s husband famously left them for Labour. These days they are probably too Europhile even for him.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Thomas Wise (IND/DEM). – Mr President, here we see one of the few cases where this Parliament is asked for real legislative input as part of a codecision procedure.
