{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, whatever the Irish Government may say, Irish people do not want to incinerate their rubbish. We are willing to reduce, reuse and recycle. In the past, Ireland has been reliant on landfill as its only option. This is changing, but even now provisions for recycling are patchy and poor in most areas.\nWith the exception of small in-house units, we have no incinerators in Ireland and consequently, our levels of dioxins are among the lowest in Europe. But now major incinerator companies circle Ireland like vultures. It will not help if we legitimise incineration by changing our definition of recovery. If we do not remain clear that incineration is disposal of the worst kind and is unsustainable, my country, Ireland, will take the easy way out, resulting in long-term harm. I therefore reject any of the amendments that want to change definitions and I want to congratulate Mr Blokland on taking a very positive and strong strategy on recycling.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, whatever the Irish Government may say, Irish people do not want to incinerate their rubbish.
