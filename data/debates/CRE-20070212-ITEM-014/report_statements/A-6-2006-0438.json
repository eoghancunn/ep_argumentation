    "paragraphs": [
        "1.Waste volumes continue to grow, both for hazardous and non-hazardous waste;\n",
        "2.The potential for waste prevention and recycling is not fully used;\n",
        "3.Illegal (cross-border) waste shipments are still increasing;\n",
        "4.Waste management generates emissions to air, water and soil;\n",
        "5.Legislation is missing for certain important waste streams;\n",
        "6.Waste legislation is in many cases poorly implemented;\n",
        "7.Member States have a different approach in solving waste problems;\n",
        "8.The current wording of EU waste law gives rise to some interpretation problems,\n",
        "1.   Recognises the Commission’s Communication on 'Taking sustainable use of resources forward: A Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste' as a basis for the discussion on future waste policy;\n",
        "2.   Stresses the substantial aim for waste management of achieving a high level of protection of the environment and human health rather than facilitating the functioning of the internal market for waste recovery;\n",
        "3.Points out that account should be taken not only of the environmental impact in the EU but also of the impact outside the EU;\n",
        "4.Underlines the importance of the general principles of waste management, such as the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, the principle of the waste generator’s responsibility and, for specific waste flows, the principle of individual producer responsibility, as well as the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency;\n",
        "5.Emphasises that full implementation of existing EU waste legislation and equal enforcement across all Member States is a key priority;\n",
        "6.Fails to understand why, despite a proposal for the revision of the Waste Framework Directive, many concrete implementing measures and instruments (which were foreseen in the 6th EAP) are missing;\n",
        "7.Stresses that changing definitions should only be undertaken for reasons of clarification, and not to weaken environmental protection rules or encourage public acceptance of a concept (for instance by softening the negative connotation of “waste” or “disposal”);\n",
        "8.Stresses that political decisions, such as the definitions of waste, recovery and disposal, must not be taken in commitology, but by codecision;\n",
        "9.Emphasises that the use of the commitology procedure should be limited to non-political decisions, especially those of a technical and scientific nature;\n",
        "10.Opposes a general declassification of waste that could lead to inappropriate environmental treatment and a lack of traceability of waste streams; emphasises that procedures for the declassification of waste could only be considered for exceptional cases of homogeneous waste streams, such as compost,recycled aggregates,recovered paperand recovered glass;\n",
        "11.Emphasises that the end-of-waste status should only be achieved after the waste stream in question has been re-used, recycled or undergone a recovery operation - which does not exclude the possibility that a recovery operation may generate new waste - and meets agreed European standards, making it fit for a purpose, and after traceability rules have been adopted and are being applied;\n",
        "12.Demands that all waste intended for energy recovery or incineration should remain waste, in respect of which Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste[6](the waste incineration directive) should apply;\n",
        "13.Emphasises that the recovery and disposal lists in the annexes to the Waste Framework Directive should be revised and adapted to current waste management practices in accordance with the codecision procedure;\n",
        "14.Expresses strong reservations on the proposed energy efficiency calculation method, and the fact that it is to apply to municipal waste incinerators only; calls on the Commission to revise the waste incineration directive, in order to set equal environmental standards (for emissions and energy efficiency) for both incineration and co-incineration of waste;\n",
        "4.2 Introducing life-cycle thinking in waste policy\n",
        "15.Emphasises the key importance of the waste hierarchy, which sets out priorities for action in descending order:\n",
        "16. Regards life-cycle thinking as a useful concept to evaluate the environmental and human health impacts of waste; stresses that the hierarchy itself is based on this concept, but acknowledges that life-cycle and other analyses can be used in exceptional cases to deviate from the waste hierarchy, though only when there is clear evidence that another option is actually better on environmental or health grounds or to avoid unreasonably high costs;\n",
        "4.3 Improving the knowledge base\n",
        "17. Supports the improvement of the knowledge base with regard to EU waste policy, but stresses that the implementation of concrete actions is more important;\n",
        "4.4 Waste prevention\n",
        "18.Regrets the lack of quantitative and qualitative reduction targets covering all relevant waste, which were indicated as one of the priority actions in the 6th EAP; calls on the Commission to come forward with a proposal for targets in its final assessment of the 6th EAP;\n",
        "19.Calls on the Commission to come forward with concrete waste prevention measures in the fields of product policy, chemicals policy and eco-design, to minimise both the generation of waste and the presence of hazardous substances in waste, and thereby foster the safe and environmentally sound treatment of waste; emphasises the importance of promoting products and technologies which are less harmful to the environment as well as products which are more suitable for re-use and recycling;\n",
        "20.Draws attention to the interaction between waste strategies and other strategies, particularly the sustainable use of natural resources, sustainable development and integrated product policy;\n",
        "21.Calls on the Commission to develop a set of indicators by 2008, as announced in the Resources Strategy;\n",
        "22.Emphasises that proper implementation of the concept of producer responsibilityis a strong instrument to prevent waste;\n",
        "23.Draws attention to the role of information campaigns on waste policy, particularly on prevention and raising public awareness of the benefits of sustainable waste management;\n",
        "24.Calls on the Commission to reinforce the waste prevention aspects of the Best Available Technique reference documents (BREFs) developed under Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control[7](the IPPC Directive) and to include relevant guidance in these documents;\n",
        "4.5Re-use\n",
        "25.Calls on the Commission to come forward with concrete measures to promote re-use and repair activities:\n",
        "4.6 Towards a European recycling society\n",
        "26.Underlines the importance of achieving common minimum standards for recovery and recycling at EU level, and stresses that a level playing field will only be established when the use of economic instruments is approximated throughout the EU;\n",
        "27.Emphasises the importance of source separation of waste, as well as recycling targets and producer responsibility in order to increase the recycling rate of certain waste streams;\n",
        "28.Recognises the need for better EU cooperation in managing cross-border waste problems;\n",
        "29.Points out that any material-based approach to boost recycling should go hand in hand with a waste stream based approach; calls on the Commission to investigate further the feasibility and economic viability of such a strategy;\n",
        "30.Calls once again on the Commission to propose separate directives on biodegradable waste, construction and demolition waste and sewage sludge, as indicated in the 6thEAP;\n",
        "31.Calls on the Commission to follow up on its Green Paper on PVC and propose a separate directive on PVC, given the numerous environmental and health problems over its entire life cycle, in particular when it becomes a waste;\n",
        "32.Calls for the quantities of waste for disposal to be reduced to a minimum; calls on the Commission again to revise the landfill directive, including a timetable:\n",
        "33.Considers that Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste[8]implements legal obligations from the UN Basel Convention and OECD Decisions; supports the prevention of eco-dumping and sham recovery and underlines that an objective of regulating shipments of waste is to enhance the re-use and recycling of waste ensuring a high level of environmental and human health protection;\n",
        "34.Emphasises the right of Member States to apply the proximity and self-sufficiency principle in relation to recovery or disposal of mixed municipal waste in order to encourage national planning of waste management and waste incineration capacity; 0 0         0\n",
        "35.Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
