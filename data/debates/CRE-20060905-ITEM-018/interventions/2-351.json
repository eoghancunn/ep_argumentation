{"speaker": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). –", "english": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this timely and well-considered report and I congratulate the rapporteur.\nFirstly, I agree that the added value of a Community strategy on mental health is primarily in the field of prevention and awareness-raising and that any proposals from the Commission should involve partnership and consultation with all relevant parties.\nAn essential element of any strategy will be to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness and this will require a multifaceted approach, including information, education, anti-discrimination legislation, community-based approaches and responsible reporting by the media.\nI fully support the proposal in the report that Member States should work together to implement effective strategies to reduce suicide, because this is not only a national or European issue but also a global one.\nIn Ireland, suicide is the most common cause of death in 18-24 year olds. Unfortunately, it is the highest within this age group in the EU. Such deaths devastate families and tear the heart out of communities. A recent survey conducted in my own area of North Leitrim and West Cavan entitled ‘Men on the Border’, painted a distressing picture of the reality of life for many single, older men, with 56% or respondents saying that they knew somebody who had committed suicide. Given that I always like to link what we do here with what is happening in our constituencies, I am pleased to say that this survey was partly funded by the EU and I hope that its recommendations will help to improve the situation.\nFinally, while expenditure on mental health is a national competence, I believe that we need to highlight the sizable differences in mental health expenditure in individual Member States and I am not proud to say that our own levels in Ireland are inadequate. I agree with the rapporteur that public pressure is needed to ensure adequate expenditure to promote mental health and to prevent mental illness.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this timely and well-considered report and I congratulate the rapporteur.\nFirstly, I agree that the added value of a Community strategy on mental health is primarily in the field of prevention and awareness-raising and that any proposals from the Commission should involve partnership and consultation with all relevant parties.\nAn essential element of any strategy will be to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness and this will require a multifaceted approach, including information, education, anti-discrimination legislation, community-based approaches and responsible reporting by the media.\nI fully support the proposal in the report that Member States should work together to implement effective strategies to reduce suicide, because this is not only a national or European issue but also a global one.\nIn Ireland, suicide is the most common cause of death in 18-24 year olds.
