{"speaker": "Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE). –", "english": "Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE). – Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his excellent report. I should also like to say that it is not just a gender issue: there is certainly a very strong racial perspective as well that is attached to mental health and mental illness. At least we are past the age where sexual orientation was seen as a mental disorder, but there is still, as others have said, a tremendous amount of work to be done. As Mr Bowis himself pointed out, we have only just begun to scratch the surface in terms of what we would call promoting mental wellbeing. The World Health Organisation describes mental health as a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\nThat has enormous implications for the social inclusion policies that we pursue and, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I want to pick up – as others have done – on the world of work, focusing in particular on paragraph 27 of the report. It is not just about the influence of mental health on employment, but the effect of employment on mental health. As others have said, stress is potentially the largest cause of time off work. The Bilbao Agency has done a lot of work on that. Self-reported work-related stress, depression or anxiety accounted in the UK recently for nearly 13 million lost working days in one year. If that had been the result of physical injury at the workplace there would have been an enormous outcry.\nMany companies do not have a policy for dealing with stress. Many managers cannot recognise it in themselves and cannot manage it in others. So we need to develop training there, and we need to have a culture at work where you can admit to stress, have it dealt with seriously and work with working practices that promote mental wellbeing.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE). – Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his excellent report.
