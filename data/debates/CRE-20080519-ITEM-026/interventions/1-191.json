For example the citizens of the British Virgin Islands or Greenland are citizens of the European Union, but European Parliamentary elections are not held in those regions, while the citizens of Aruba are citizens of the European Union who happen to be entitled to vote in the European Parliamentary elections. But even more confusing is the fact that none of the aforementioned territories is actually a part of the European Union.\nIt is my firm belief that the European Union’s relationship with the Member States’ overseas territories and citizens of all those territories should become uniform, bearing in mind the equal treatment of the citizens of the European Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Toomas Savi (ALDE) , in writing . – This report gives a good overview of the problems that the Azores, the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthelemy are facing as geographically distant regions of the European Union, but it also points out the disparities in the treatment of different overseas territories of the Member States.\nThere are still several regions under the sovereignty of Member States that do not share the same status as the outermost regions.
