{"speaker": "Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE). –", "english": "Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE). – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on this report. I am pleased that we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses are a problem and I welcome the new measures we are taking in this report. I hope we continue in this way.\nHaving said that, I am pleased that the situation in Kashmir has been included. I hope we will eventually find a just solution involving the Kashmiri people that will end human rights abuses from all sides. I am also glad that we call in this report for the Americans to close down Guantanamo Bay. I think it is very important that we do this and that detainees have a fair trial. Again, that is included in this report. I am sorry, however, that my amendment on CIA flights was not accepted by the committee, but I note Amendment 5, which seeks to rectify this situation. It is very important that we include CIA flights in this report.\nI would have liked a stronger statement on people with mental health problems, as the rapporteur knows, but I am pleased that they have been included. I am equally pleased that disabled people have been included generally, with a particular emphasis on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. As many of you know, I was Parliament’s rapporteur on that issue.\nI am glad that there is a strong mention of trafficking in human beings. I, along with Mr Coveney and various other Members, have been campaigning on this subject for quite some time.\nI am sorry, however, that we are told repeatedly in our committee that we cannot mention human rights abuses within the European Union. That, I believe, takes away from the strength of our argument when we are talking about human rights abuses in other parts of the world.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE). – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on this report.
