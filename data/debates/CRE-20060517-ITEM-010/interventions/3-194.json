{"speaker": "Sajjad Karim (ALDE). –", "english": "Sajjad Karim (ALDE). – Mr President, we find ourselves once again debating the situation of human rights in the world. I thank the rapporteur for his evident hard work in compiling this comprehensive report, for the cooperative attitude he has demonstrated throughout and his support for the inclusion of Kashmir. For this, I personally thank him.\nColleagues, we often speak of human rights in the abstract, in terms of well-rehearsed subjects and themes, but in this instance I should like to ask colleagues to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday abroad. You take a taxi journey to visit your friends and family that ends in tragedy. There are no witnesses, for the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first policeman you can find. You say he pulled a gun on you and what you did was in self-defence. This leads to a legal process which finds you innocent, then finds you guilty, then starts over again until every appeal is exhausted and you are ultimately condemned to death, with due legal process having been thrown out of the equation. All this takes 18 years; half your life on death row: a cruel life sentence in itself. This is not an abstraction. This is the tale of the rough justice of a British and EU citizen, Mirza Tahir Hussain, condemned to death on 1 June – his 36th birthday – a matter of days away.\nToday, we reaffirm this House’s role as a defender of human rights with a long history of opposition to the death penalty. I implore you all to live up to the responsibility this position carries and make representations to the President of Pakistan, appealing for clemency for Mirza Tahir Hussain.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Sajjad Karim (ALDE). – Mr President, we find ourselves once again debating the situation of human rights in the world.
