{"speaker": "Simon Coveney,", "english": "Simon Coveney, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, firstly, I welcome the change in the scheduling of debates to allow the human rights report to be debated this afternoon in the primetime slot. I want to thank the chairmen of the various groups for that. It is recognition of the importance of this report.\nThis year, we have a very different report, in style and in content. We are essentially undertaking an experiment. Parliament has agreed to change the format of its human rights report to have a much tighter focus on issues where the EU has a direct impact or influence and to focus on EU human rights policy, in particular on guidelines that have been set out and the performance of the three institutions in implementing those guidelines.\nWe are doing this on the understanding that the Council will work closely with us to produce a common and unified human rights report for the EU. That report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges, as well as the more local challenges. In the past, as you know, Parliament and the Council have both essentially duplicated each other’s work to a certain extent by producing similar reports. Certainly, as rapporteur last year, I saw a huge amount of duplication between the report produced by Parliament and the one the Council produced.\nHowever, if the Council does not significantly consult and include Parliament when putting its report together in the coming year, we will have to revert to our previous approach. I appeal to the Council, therefore, to make the new formula work so that we can have a common, strong, unified human rights report, representing a European view on human rights, that we can send to all corners of the world. Parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do: assessing the performance of the Council and the Commission on behalf of the people.\nFinally, I want to congratulate Mr Howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances. The fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done. I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Coveney, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, firstly, I welcome the change in the scheduling of debates to allow the human rights report to be debated this afternoon in the primetime slot.
