{"speaker": "Eoin Ryan,", "english": "Eoin Ryan, on behalf of the UEN Group . – Mr President, the report on the table today demonstrates, once again, the relentless attack on Member States that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes. I do not accept that low corporation tax leads to unfair tax competition. I believe that ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the tax policy mix of a fully functioning single market.\nWhere is the Commission’s evidence to prove that CCCTB will not hamper EU competitiveness? Where is the proof to say that it will benefit EU competitiveness? Why is it that countries with low tax, low unemployment and high growth are being attacked by the Commission? I do not understand it. It is absolutely farcical for the Commission to say that setting a tax base will not eventually set a tax rate, because that is already what the larger Member States are saying. It does not stand up to any kind of scrutiny.\nAttempts by large Member States to giftwrap tax harmonisation in the flowery paper of CCCTB will not be accepted by Ireland or other Member States. The fact of the matter is that it is not the right of Ireland, or any other Member State, to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State. The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies; rather, the EU’s competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies. I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition, not tax harmonisation.\nHow is it that a country like Ireland, and other Member States, which changed radically their tax policies and became successful economies, are now under attack? What is the attractiveness of a country like Ireland, Commissioner, if you bring in this system and eventually bring in tax harmonisation? Because that is exactly what it is, and the only way tax will go is up. It has already been said, by people within the Commission, that they want to see a tax regime more or less in the middle of what it is at the moment, which is approximately in the low 20%. What would be the attractiveness of Ireland or other peripheral countries? There would be not attractiveness, just high unemployment in the long...\n(The President cut off the speaker)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Eoin Ryan, on behalf of the UEN Group . – Mr President, the report on the table today demonstrates, once again, the relentless attack on Member States that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes.
