    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Recalls that decisions linked to fiscal policy, such as the provision of fiscal incentives to undertakings, are the main instrument for developing and increasing the number of jobs, but also for increasing R&D investment and environmentally friendly technologies; stresses, however, that if fiscal policy is to make a substantive contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, the constant monitoring of the manner of redistributing additional revenue generated by such tax relief for undertakings is needed, with a view to ensuring that the additional revenue is in fact used to boost the labour market or make further investments in innovation and more energy-efficient technology;\n",
        "2.  Notes the trend in declining corporation tax rates in the European Union as well as in other OECD countries, which reflects increasing global competition, structural change and development in financial markets, notes however that the overall taxation level in Europe remains higher in comparison to that of other OECD countries; also draws attention to the fact that public revenue as a whole has increased despite declining effective rates of corporate tax; notes the need for a coordinated fiscal framework, including corporate tax arrangements, which should be favourable to companies, in particular SMEs, and geared to renewing growth and generating employment;\n",
        "3.  Shares the concern expressed in the Commission's communication on 'Coordinating Member States' direct tax systems in the internal market' that lack of coordination between direct tax systems may also lead to unintended non-taxation or abuse and, hence, erosion of tax revenues;\n",
        "4.  Regards it as necessary to set up a public finance policy environment that is favourable to growth and employment in the economy, and to promote healthy tax competition in the European Union so that the tax burden is widely shared by employees and consumers, businesses and those deriving income from capital; points out that, in terms of state funding, the European Union must promote tax arrangements to facilitate competition in the global economy, in order to encourage the creation of new businesses and technological innovation;\n",
        "5.   Underlines that, in general, tax systems in the Member States have gone too far in applying relatively high rates to low tax brackets, which discourages risk-taking and start-ups;\n",
        "6.   Considers that it is possible to have competitive tax arrangements without undermining state funding, as seen in those European countries that have in the last decade succeeded in increasing their tax revenue through tax cuts accompanied by a widening of tax bases, while controlling expenditure, thereby reducing their deficits;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the Commission's intention to develop solutions for problems arising from transfer pricing rules in the European Union;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes the Commission's proposed pilot project to apply the principle of home state taxation to corporation tax paid by SMEs;\n",
        "9.  Recognises the difficulties facing SMEs in the European Union and in other OECD countries in financing their projects and endorses the provision of fiscal incentives to encourage SMEs to take more advantage of intermediary financing mechanisms, such as entrepreneurial share capital, business angel networks, etc.;\n",
        "10. Draws attention to the shortfall in public revenue caused in the European Union by tax fraud and urges the Commission and the Member States to take further action to combat tax fraud;\n",
        "11. Takes the view that in order effectively to combat tax evasion and tax fraud, a radical change is needed in the way that fiscal services operate based on modern organisational and sound administration principles and stresses that the Commission should take significant initiatives to support coordination at Community level in this sector;\n",
        "12. Considers that VAT relief for community-oriented public or semi-public undertakings must be retained; believes that a one-stop-shop for companies to deal with their EU-wide VAT obligation must  be introduced;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Member States to seek to ensure greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden;\n",
        "14. Criticises the upward trend of VAT rates in the European Union, which has a regressive effect and reduces demand; stresses that the experience in some Member States has shown that greater revenue is generated when the tax base is widened, when employment growth causes an increase in consumption and when the conditions are right for black economy activities to become regularised, a process that would be endangered by an increase in VAT rates;\n",
        "15. Reiterates its support for  experimenting  with lower VAT rates for labour-intensive services as a structural element of the VAT system, with flexibility for Member States to apply such rates in sectors of proximity services that are mainly local and do not distort cross-border competition;.\n",
        "16. Supports the Commission's efforts to gear fiscal policy towards more ambitious environmental objectives; considers that such action can promote greater research into, and a greater application of, environmental technologies, thereby developing the European Union's competitive potential in this field;\n",
        "17. Notes that there is a need for an entirely new approach regarding excise duty policy; stresses that a policy line that is oriented to the determination of the minimum tax rate at the Community level should be rejected and that a generic code of conduct should instead be adopted, with the objective of encouraging Member States to approximate more closely their highly divergent rates of excise duty;\n",
        "18. Believes that fiscal policy should generally contribute to requiring industry to internalise external costs but considers it appropriate to retain or introduce tax and other incentives to promote clean, non-fossil alternative energy sources;\n",
        "19. Considers that an increase in fuel taxes would have a positive environmental impact if economical and attractive means of mass transport were available;\n",
        "20. Believes that countries that are in the process of catching up are faced with higher external costs, for which they should not be penalised;\n",
        "21. Stresses the need to continue reducing taxes on employment as an important way to achieve the Lisbon objective of an employment rate of 70 %;\n",
        "22. Considers it important for the completion of the internal market to simplify customs legislation and to rationalise customs procedures with the purpose of reducing the administrative cost for enterprises engaged in cross-border transactions, maintaining a simplification of enterprises' cross-border compliance obligations; supports moving towards a simplified system for levying VAT on cross-border sales in the European Union, for example, by implementing the reverse charge mechanism;\n",
        "23. Supports the Commission's efforts to establish a pan-European and uniform consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB); notes that the CCCTB will lead to greater transparency by enabling companies to operate according to the same rules abroad as at home, will increase cross-border trade and investment, and will significantly reduce administrative costs and the possibility of tax evasion and fraud; considers it necessary that measures specifically designed to reduce tax compliance costs faced by SMEs, such as home state taxation provisions, be introduced;\n",
        "24. Recalls that the CCCTB involves common rules regarding the tax base and in no way affects the freedom of Member States to continue setting their own tax rates;\n",
        "25. Welcomes the Commission's intention to launch the CCCTB even in the framework of enhanced cooperation; points out, however, that this is a second-best solution, as in the absence of a comprehensive Community-wide system, the benefits of transparency and lower administrative costs may be partly mitigated;\n",
        "26. Welcomes the Commission's view that the new tax base must be uniform and simplify the situation and recommends, while defining a framework of common standards, the development of a mechanism of allocating revenues among the Member States concerned;\n",
        "27. Welcomes the Commission Communication 'Towards more effective use of tax incentives in favour of R&D' and highlights the need to share best practices and to clarify, to a maximum degree, the compatibility of such incentives with Community law;\n",
        "28. Stresses that green taxation is a flexible policy instrument for achieving a given pollution target, for providing incentives for technological innovation and for further reducing pollutant emissions;\n",
        "29. Encourages the Commission to address the issues relating to the consolidation of accounts, taxation and tax administration of the large groups operating across borders;\n",
        "30. Considers that tax incentives to encourage R&D activities are of great importance to achieve the Lisbon Strategy goals, such as increasing R&D spending in Europe, in particular as regards facilitating R&D+i activities for SMEs; notes, however, that such tax incentives should not be used as indirect subsidies to national firms;\n",
        "31. Is convinced that tax policy should be drawn up in such a way as to induce productivity-led growth in all sectors of the economy by allowing a taxpayer to either deduct or claim tax depreciation in respect of R&D expenditure;\n",
        "32.        Believes that the technological gap among Member States means that there are differences in tax policy and that action should only be taken at Community level when action by individual Member States cannot provide an effective solution; is of the opinion that the promotion of good practices for the design of R&D tax initiatives and better co-ordination of tax policy would help Member States meet the Lisbon objectives;\n",
        "33. Urges the Commission to adopt a more proactive strategy with regard to offshore financial centres;\n",
        "34. Supports the Commission's view that, when assets are transferred to a third country, it is justified, because of the lack of cross-border administrative cooperation, to require taxes to be payable at the time of exit;\n",
        "35.  Notes that cases concerning taxation are frequently brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities and that this is mainly because of the lack of transparency and the high level of complexity of the taxation systems in Europe and calls, therefore, for a simplification of tax codes across the European Union; regards the ruling of the Court of Justice in theMarks & SpencerCase as giving Member States the right to maintain their tax systems; believes that, in situations involving cross-border losses by foreign subsidiaries, the double taxation of parent companies must be avoided, fiscal competence must be fairly distributed between Member States, losses should not be offset twice, and tax avoidance must be prevented;\n",
        "36. Notes that without channels of cross-border loss relief, firms will seek to ensure that their profits are taxed in countries where the size of the home market is sufficient to generate enough profit to offset possible losses abroad;\n",
        "37. Considers that it is necessary to work towards a system of cross-border loss relief, both for companies and groups with units abroad; welcomes the Commission communication on tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations;\n",
        "38. Regards the Commission communication on tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations as an appropriate basis for further discussion, specifically as regards the possible solutions, pending the application of the CCCTB,  identified in the communication for implementing a system of loss relief and recapture by the host Member State;\n",
        "39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
