While the subject matter was obviously very controversial and topical, what we are talking about here tonight in this debate is how the Commission deals with complaints. We support the Ombudsman’s conclusions in relation to the inordinate delay, as acknowledged by the Commission this evening in this House.\nLet me just say that, on the point of complaints, people get in touch with the Commission because they have a problem and expect some sort of response – perhaps not an immediate one, but certainly nothing that takes months and years.\nI would bring to your attention an issue concerning Equitable Life, where we had some light-touch regulation and not great clarity about how Community law was actually being implemented – and we have seen the dire consequences of that particular issue.\nLastly, there is a current complaint with the Commission about the application of Irish planning law. While the Commission was very active and supportive initially, I fear that there is now a silence. I would like some progress on that issue.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I should like to thank Mr De Rossa for his report.\nI listened very carefully to the Commission’s response, and I would like to repeat that this report is about how the Commission dealt with a complaint.
