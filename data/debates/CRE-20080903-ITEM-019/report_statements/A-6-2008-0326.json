    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Stresses that Europe's freight transport systems must meet pressing challenges to increase effective integration and sustainability of freight transport in Europe, making a greater contribution to improving mobility, energy efficiency, reducing oil consumption, polluting emissions, and external costs, and therefore welcomes the above-mentioned Commission communications and Council conclusions; encourages the Commission, the Member States and industry to support in future a freight transport policy which is more sustainable in terms of mobility for the environment, climate, the economy, security and social interests, by promoting the use, in an enlarged European Union, of more efficient logistics systems as part of the gradual integration of priority cross-border rail freight corridors, hubs and conventional networks, and by promoting the user and polluter pays principles for all modes of transport;\n",
        "2.  Supports the view of the Commission that co-modality and intermodality remain key factors in creating sustainable and efficient freight transport in Europe;\n",
        "3.  Notes, however, that the EU’s powers and resources for improving freight transport markets are limited; notes that key parts of the network are already being used at full capacity; therefore urges Transport Ministers responsible for the main European Corridors to take up the issue of infrastructure investments and at least agree on coordinating their National Investment Plans in relation to their respective corridors;\n",
        "4.  Is convinced that urban freight logistics require a specific approach; hopes that the debate on the above-mentioned Green Paper on Urban Mobility together with the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan can result in an exchange of good practices between towns in order to find sustainable ways of transporting supplies to towns;\n",
        "5.  Suggests, therefore, that the Commission proposes, no later than the end of 2008, a programme for strengthening cooperation between the Member States responsible for projects in this area, and that it facilitates and assesses solutions to the current blockages, with particular attention to goods transport, taking due account of the added value of the logistics factor;\n",
        "6.  Supports the idea of dedicated goods transport networks, which should exploit existing conventional traffic networks which are being freed-up as a result of the progress made with high-speed trains;\n",
        "7.  Stresses that the rail freight network should be based on the most \"market-relevant\" freight corridors taking into account the existing ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) corridors and TEN-T (Trans-European Transport) network, (i.e. extended as necessary to include specific areas generating heavy volumes of traffic, e.g. ports); considers that \"high level corridor coordinators\" should be appointed, wherever this has not yet been done; calls upon the European Railway Agency, as the ERTMS system authority, to ensure that these routes become interoperable;\n",
        "8.  Looks to the Commission to define the 'green corridors' as exemplary mobility and inter-modality projects, to shift to environmentally friendly modes to reduce overall accidents, congestion, noise, local toxic and non-toxic pollution, CO2emissions, landscape and energy consumption and to increase the use of renewable sources (particularly wind and solar energy) in accordance with EU legislation, its objectives and the intelligent transport systems;\n",
        "9.  Urges the Commission and the Member States in this connection to offer stronger incentives to boost the environmental performance of all modes of transport and to support the most efficient combinations of modes of transport with a view to achieving the lowest possible impact on the environment, especially in the 'green' corridors;\n",
        "10. Proposes that support be given to the integration of regional planning, production processes and market structures – including the avoidance of unnecessary transport – and to shortening distances and adjusting speeds in freight transport; takes the view that time-consuming and energy-intensive ‘stop-go’ freight transport should be avoided by means of computerised speed adjustment;\n",
        "11. Regards it as a priority to improve proper implementation and strengthening of existing legislation regarding the transport of hazardous and polluting goods;\n",
        "12. Urges the Commission and Member States to press forward  with the exchange of best practice in sensitive cross-border areas (mountainous areas and conurbations), as well as in cities, taking account of the recommendations included in its above-mentioned resolution on urban mobility and of the experience gained from the CIVITAS programme on cleaner and better transport in cities, by enhancing the logistics aspect;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission to concentrate EU co-financing on the efficiency, interoperability and upgrading of rail infrastructure, intermodal hubs as well as all other modes of freight transport and to allocate at least 40% of EU transport infrastructure appropriations to the railways, as called for in its resolution of 12 July 2007 on the implementation of the first railway package[3];\n",
        "14. Calls also on the Commission and Member States, pending the overhaul of the European Union's budget anticipated for 2009, already to consider the position of transport in that budget, in order to avoid any repetition of past errors and ensure sufficient future investment in strategic infrastructure in order to attain the objectives which the Union has set for itself with regard to sustainable development and emission reduction;\n",
        "15. Stresses the utmost importance of interoperable road charging for efficient freight transport in Europe;\n",
        "16. Considers better links from maritime and inland ports to their hinterland rail and road network to be an important element in transport infrastructure; highlights the important role of internal platforms and dry docks;\n",
        "17. Is convinced of the potential of inland waterways regarding freight transport and urges the Commission to ensure proper implementation of the NAIADES action programme on promoting inland waterway transport in Europe;\n",
        "18. Stresses that investments in hinterland terminals can be put into effect flexibly and rapidly, thereby eliminating bottlenecks in the intermodal chain as a whole;\n",
        "19. Calls for  the compliance with, and/or introduction of, stable intermodal standards for the dimensions and weight of vehicles, containers and loading equipment, to be considered as being of strategic importance with a view to shifting freight transport to rail and sustainable waterways, thereby reducing infrastructure costs;\n",
        "20. Notes that various horizontal techniques which would help simplify the transfer of freight not only from lorries to rail but also between differing rail gauges are often insufficiently standardised; therefore urges the international and European bodies to standardise these technologies in particular with a view to greater efficiency and cost reduction; stresses in this connection the importance of quickly adopting a worldwide standard for intermodal loading units;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to draft its guidelines for environmental and railway subsidies in such a way as to simplify investments in sustainable rail freight transport; stresses in this connection the strategic importance of co-financing of noise reduction, including at source (retrofitting of goods trucks), such as already exists for the fitting of rolling stock with ERTMS;\n",
        "22. Is convinced that infrastructure management and the provision of services must take place on a cross-border, non-discriminatory and transparent basis with a view to achieving efficient, interoperable and smooth-running freight transport logistics; stresses in this respect the importance of the further completion of the internal transport market for all modes of transport; welcomes in this connection the Commission proposal for the establishment of a 'European maritime transport space without barriers' and supports the idea of a single transport document and 'single points of interface' for all modes of transport;\n",
        "23. Stresses that an internal market in road haulage which functions effectively could help to make transport more efficient and reduce the number of unladen journeys; calls on the Commission to strictly enforce EU legislation on international road haulage and cabotage; recognises that Member States are permitted to restrict cabotage under certain conditions, but calls on the Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, to take rigorous action against disproportionate restrictions and penalties which a number of Member States are imposing on foreign carriers in this connection;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission, in multi-annual contracts for rail infrastructure quality, to draw up framework conditions for minimum quality standards throughout Europe; proposes that the Member States link the availability of appropriations for rail infrastructure construction, extension and maintenance to these quality standards and treat them as indivisible packages, thus contributing to increased efficiency and financial savings;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission to support projects concerning the differential use of high-speed lines e.g. for light freight transport;\n",
        "26. Urges the Commission to carry out a survey of freight trucks equipped with satellite navigation in the EU with a view to testing the cross-border interoperability and/or compatibility of such systems with existing technology, to ensure the fitting of inter-operable satellite navigation systems for new freight trucks and promote the retrofitting of existing trucks; advocates the adoption of best practice in loading techniques, thereby structuring the intermodal chain from beginning to end of the transfer and unloading process in such a way as to boost the efficiency of the whole sector;\n",
        "27. Stresses the need to standardise and to simplify the administrative procedures of the authorities involved in the freight transport market, together with simplified customs rules and procedures at borders; welcomes in particular the decision to establish a European maritime space without barriers, urges the Commission to ask the appropriate international associations and organisations to develop a single intermodal document;\n",
        "28. Stresses that there is a lack of good logistics education delivered by universities and therefore calls on the Member States to give absolute priority to higher education and further education in the logistic and freight transport sector;\n",
        "29. Urges the Commission to support projects and research, and work towards standard information flows to ensure the integration and interoperability of modes at data level;\n",
        "30. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
