    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Notes that economic recovery in the euro zone has become a self-sustaining process with domestic demand acting as the main driver; observes that 2 million jobs were created in 2006 and that unemployment fell from 8,4% to 7,6%; but notes that structural impediments,in particular the paucity of public and private investment in certain key sectors such as research, education and training,continue to contribute to this unacceptably high level of unemployment and participation in the labour market is still low by international standards;\n",
        "2.  Emphasises that, against the background of the recent  recovery, any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth; points out that in order to support the economic recovery, Member States must implement both the necessary structural reforms and investment activities;\n",
        "3.  Considers that it is still too early to distinguish the cyclical dimension from the structural one in this recovery; considers, however, that some structural reforms, larger than usually estimated, may have already fed through into growth; deems that such recovery should be taken as an incentive to pursue national reforms adapted to each country, notably in the domain of research, innovation and education, in order to increase the potential for growth of the euro zone;\n",
        "4.  Notes the low growth in labour productivity and considers that it is crucial that wages increase in line with developments in productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment;\n",
        "5.  Notes that the ECB assesses wage development as an upside risk to price stability; recalls in this context that the Commission's Annual Report on the Euro Area 2007 (SEC(2007)0550) makes plain that wages in the euro area have continued to grow moderately in spite of a sharp rise in oil prices;\n",
        "6.  Emphasises that the Treaty explicitly distinguishes between the goals of price stability and support for general economic policies and that, therefore, the two goals cannot simply be treated as substitutable;\n",
        "7.  Deems that fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth and must be carefully designed so as to enhance the quality of public expenditure; considers that the golden rule by which a fiscal deficit can be accounted for by investments only is a significant step in this direction;\n",
        "8.  Observes that some economies in the euro zonehave performed muchbetter than others in terms of growth, with, notably, Ireland, Luxembourg,Greece, Finland and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the euro zone average; notes that higher average growth has also applied to several European countries outside the euro area; considers that useful lessons could be drawn from such developments and that a specific study by the ECB of the reasons underlying these trends would be useful;\n",
        "9.  Notes that the economic cycles followed by the economies of the Member States in the euro zone are at very different stages; calls on the ECB to examine whether such widely divergent behaviour in a single monetary zone could pose a problem in future in terms of stability and economic growth;\n",
        "10. Expresses concerns about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major foreign currencies; points out in this connection that Article 111 of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council, but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised; calls on the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective competences in full and to coordinate their actions in the field of exchange rate policy more closely; observes that such appreciation has not been harmful to exports on the euro zone level so far, but that the effects vary among Member States ; underlines the risks associated with large global current account imbalances which could result in additional increases in the euro exchange rate; notes that there is now a broad consensus among policy makers on how to tackle the problem of global imbalances; notes that the efforts made by the international community and international financial institutions  have been far from adequate; hopes that the implementation of these measures (the adoption of measures to reduce the budget deficit and promote private savings in the USA and to achieve greater exchange rate flexibility in a number of surplus countries in emerging Asia, in particular China), which is to be monitored by the IMF, will make a significant contribution to the gradual resolution of global imbalances;\n",
        "11. Observes that throughout the euro zone, real estate prices have experienced stark increases for about 10 years now with few exceptions, most notably in Germany; notes that, although there are some signs that this development is slowing down, credit granted to households for the acquisition of property is still rising by around 10 % per year; observes that there has been a decline in US housing prices and a recent deterioration in the mortgage credit market which could have an impact on the real economy; deems that such a development should be taken as a warning for what could take place in the euro area; calls for the ECB to monitor closely these developments which have the potential to have consequences for the real economy; requests the ECB to present ways forward with their respective advantages such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices, or devising a specific type of indicator, or to suggest specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among national markets;\n",
        "12. Is concerned that interest rates on loans to households for consumption purposes showed the highest level of dispersion; notes in particular that interest rates on overdrafts vary considerably within the euro zone, from less than 7 % to 13,5 % or more, and recommends further ECB research on the reasons for this;\n",
        "13. Notes that the ECB and its Executive Board are independent; stresses the necessity of respecting the constitutional principle set out in Article 112(2)(b) of the Treaty; reiterates its support for the independence of the ECB and for sustaining the aim of maintaining price stability and protecting its anti-inflation credentials;\n",
        "14. Takes the view that the degree of maturity achieved by all the players in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism should facilitate the emergence of a policy mix to accompany the effective implementation of the requisite structural adjustments on which any increase in the potential for growth in the euro zone depends; advocates a more active macroeconomic dialogue between the Council, the Commission, the ECB, the Parliament and the European social partners and supports the Eurogroup's efforts to bring about such dialogue;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the publication of a new ECB annual report on financial integration in Europe as a useful contribution for advancing European financial integration;\n",
        "16. Fully supports the ECB's efforts to foster financial integration in the euro zone, notably by acting as a catalyst for private sector initiatives such as the single European payments area (SEPA) and Short-Term European Paper (STEP); recognises the importance of further financial integration to help protect the European Union from external economic shocks;\n",
        "17. Considers that ECB services can foster European financial integration and notes in this respect that Target has been instrumental in achieving a high integration of the money markets and the repo market; considers that the Target 2 Securities project might havethe potential to foster the integration, the efficiency and the safety of the clearing and settlement infrastructure which currently offers an insufficient degree of integration and interoperability; however, emphasises that this will make the ECB an active market operator, so requiring appropriate scrutiny of the ECB outside its area of responsibility in monetary policy; recalls that the presentation of an appropriate governance is overdue; therefore notes with interest the Target 2 Securities project and will continue to closely monitor developments in this project; deems it essential that an appropriate governance be put in place;\n",
        "18.Is fully aware of the rapid rise of alternative investment vehicles (hedge funds and private equity), recognises that they provide liquidity and diversification in the market and create an opportunity to improve efficiency of corporate, but shares also the concerns of some central banks and supervisors that they may  give rise to systemic risk, and to high levels of exposure of other financial institutions; welcomes the Commission's recent studies on hedge funds and private equity , but regrets that these studies have so far focused only on barriers to growth of such funds; invites the Commission to monitor any potential  policy gaps, and asks for a broader and more critical approach with regard to the extent to which hedge funds pose a risk to financial stability and to the risk management of the level of leverage and diversification; urges the Commission to assess the quality of supervision in offshore locations and to step up cooperation with the supervisors in these jurisdictions;\n",
        "19. Observes that non-bank lenders (private equity) are playing an increasing role in the leveraged sector in the European Union and are prepared in many cases to take on a higher risk than traditional banking institutions; furthermore, notes that non-bank lenders have made a significant contribution to greater employment and growth in the companies in their sector; deems that it could raise problems when the credit cycle next turns and could lead to a much more complex cycle of large corporate debt restructuring; requests the ECB and other bodies involved to assess the adequacy of current debt restructuring processes in this new context;\n",
        "20. Takes note of the strong position taken by the ECB against detailed plans for a public bail-out of a failing bank within the European Union; deems that more work on improving cooperation and planning of stress tests is required, but thatit is right that moral hazard should be minimised by a firm commitment to the primacy of private sector solutions in crisis management in order not to encourage banks to take ill-considered risks;\n",
        "21. Reiterates its call on the Council and the ECB in the context of data transfers by SWIFT to the US authorities to reflect together on the way to improve the system of supervision of SWIFT, as well as its call on the ECB for action in its role regarding SWIFT as an overseer, a user and a policymaker;\n",
        "22. Notes that the euro has undergone a successful phase of development towards a reserve and reference currency in worldwide use; points out that further steps are necessary in order to continue the positive development of cash usage of the euro (e.g. the billing of aerospace products and commodities in euro);\n",
        "23. Repeats its request for moves to unify representation of the euro zone within international financial institutions so as to defend its interests with a force consistent with its economic weight;\n",
        "24. Calls on the ECB to closely monitor developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and, in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro, to quantify and analyse the effects of this, particularly as regards exchange rates;\n",
        "25. Considers, regarding the procedure for appointing the members of the Executive Board of the ECB, that ex-ante democratic accountability and transparency would improve if the Council evaluated several potential candidates and if the candidate proposed by the Council were then subject to a vote of approval by the Parliament; stresses its willingness to join the other institutions in exploring possible improvements in the procedure of appointment before the Executive Board next comes up for renewal in 2010;\n",
        "26. Emphasises that the credibility of the ECB is also dependent on a high degree of transparency in its decision-making process; therefore reiterates its call that, shortly after meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, summary minutes of these meetings be published containing a clear statement of the arguments in favour and against the decisions taken and whether or not these decisions were taken unanimously;\n",
        "27.     Points out that it rejected as too complex the system of rotating voting rights applicable to decisions of the Governing Council as adopted in 2003; considers, with a view to future enlargements of the euro zone, that a system should be introduced which combines fairness and effectiveness;\n",
        "28.     Invites the ECB to give greater weight in its communication strategy to the hearings of its President by the Parliament committee responsible for economic and monetary affairs;\n",
        "29. Notes that the value of the euro banknotes in circulation has continued to increase quickly, with a rise of 11,2 % in 2006; notes that this steady increase continued to be mainly accounted for by large denomination notes, in particular EUR 500 banknotes, the number of these in circulation having increased by 13,2 %; reiterates its call to the ECB to examine the reasons for this substantial increase and to analyse the type of transactions carried out with these notes and the breakdown in demand by country, with a view to identifying any attendant risks; 0     0 0\n",
        "30. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the President of the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank.\n"
