{"speaker": "John Whittaker (IND/DEM). –", "english": "John Whittaker (IND/DEM). – Mr President, I see from this report that there is to be no relief from this programme of spending our money to promote gender awareness, interfering in business hiring decisions and forcing firms to offer flexible working and generous leave arrangements, but nowhere do I see any recognition of side effects. There is no understanding that much of this social engineering is largely self-defeating.\nThe simple logic, like it or not, is that if it costs more to hire women, then fewer women will be hired, despite the rules that prevent employers from mentioning gender in job advertisements and interviews. All legislation designed to prevent discrimination against women, or old people, or minorities, has the undesirable result of demeaning those who would have achieved without the legislation.\nAll our jobs, for women and men, depend on the wealth generated by the economy. Most jobs are provided by small businesses. Well, unlike in this Parliament, out there in the real world of small business, women and men are employed and they earn money by producing goods and services that other people are happy to pay for. This obsession with promoting gender equality is just one of many sources of interference in small business. If we continue to add more cost and more restrictions, then business will hire less and pay less. In the end we might be more equal, but we shall all be poorer, both women and men.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Whittaker (IND/DEM). – Mr President, I see from this report that there is to be no relief from this programme of spending our money to promote gender awareness, interfering in business hiring decisions and forcing firms to offer flexible working and generous leave arrangements, but nowhere do I see any recognition of side effects.
