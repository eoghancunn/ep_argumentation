    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Welcomes the efforts of the Commission to intensify its actions promoting equality between women and men;\n",
        "2.   Welcomes the focus of the Commission report on equality on employment issues such as the gender pay gap, conciliation and the equal treatment Directives, since economic independence for women is one of the priorities of the Roadmap for equality between women and men;\n",
        "3.   Welcomes the culture of equality in the EU, including the Commission's Roadmap for Equality and the Council's Pact for Gender Equality, and calls for its practical implementation by way of concrete measures and allocation of financial resources;\n",
        "4.   Stresses that further efforts and further measures to overcome outdated decision-making and behavioural patterns, particularly in the administrative sector, are required in order to improve gender mainstreaming across policy areas;\n",
        "5.   Points out that gender mainstreaming at EU level is being conducted as a dual strategy seeking to ensure, on the one hand, equality for men and women in all policy and decision-making areas and, on the other, targeted measures to curb discrimination against women;\n",
        "6.   Calls on the Commission to propose, in addition to the gender mainstreaming approach, a series of specific measures, including awareness-raising campaigns, the exchange of best practices, dialogues with citizens and public-private partnership initiatives;\n",
        "7.   Appreciates the potential of social cohesion policy for promoting equality;\n",
        "8.   Insists on the need to have a clear and permanent link between the annual reports on equality and the priorities defined in the Roadmap in order to implement an efficient cycle of planning, monitoring and evaluation of gender equality policies; encourages the Commission to work towards this cycle;\n",
        "9.   Recalls its request in its resolution of 2 February 2006 on equality between women and men in the European Union[3]that the Commission monitor compliance by the Member States with the 'acquis communautaire' in the area of equality between women and men in all policies, particularly employment policies but also those concerning the access to and provision of goods and services; calls, therefore, on the Commission to carry out a study on how Member States implement Community legislation in the area of equality and to take appropriate action in the event of non-transposition or infringement;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Member States to support the Commission in monitoring the implementation of national measures in order to assess the effectiveness of policies and respect for the principle of equality, in particular with regard to statutory entitlements and pension and social security schemes;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Member States to put forward specific measures to combat inequalities between women and men caused by interrupted patterns of employment resulting in particular from maternity leave or leave to care for dependants and to reduce their negative effects on careers, wages and pension entitlements and to work towards gender-neutral wages and pensions; calls on the Commission to find appropriate means to combat the gender segregation of the labour market and to facilitate women’s entry into non-traditional sectors;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission to develop gender analysis and mainstreaming on the impact of pension reforms on women's lives in the EU with the objectives of individualising pensions rights and social security and tax systems as well;\n",
        "13. Welcomes the consultation procedure with the social partners launched by the Commission in order to improve both the legislative and non-legislative frameworks for reconciliation of professional, family and private lives; encourages the Commission to launch without delay the second phase of the consultation;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission to gather and disseminate best practices with regard to working environment policies which allow for an effective work-life balance and with regard to measures fostering greater involvement by men in family life; calls on Member States and the social partners to take the necessary measures to be able partly to prevent, and partly to intervene to deal with, sexual and moral harassment in the work-place; insists that women must be supported in their professional careers; urges the Commission and the Member States to take serious measures to reduce the gender pay gap and to promote both parental leave for men and paternity leave;\n",
        "15. Notes that reconciliation of work, private and family lives is an important issue and one of the keys to increasing employment and reducing the burden of demographic ageing; points out that all policies in this area must be based on the principle of free personal choice and be geared to the various stages in life;\n",
        "16. Regrets the fact that the Commission omitted to consult social partners when drafting the Green Paper on modernising labour law;\n",
        "17. Notes that globalisation has been a positive force, empowering women all over the world to reach their potential, namely through improved access to education and healthcare; notes, however, that trade liberalisation has created contradictory and simultaneous trends, on the one hand effectively promoting the formalisation of labour relations in a number of areas, and, on the other, expanding the informal economy with new types of work and income for women, such as home-based work, sub-contracting and micro-enterprises;\n",
        "18. Notes that one effect of increased globalisation is the feminisation of poverty and that thorough research should be carried out to ascertain the total impact of globalisation on women's ability to earn a living;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to ensure that all future trade agreements, for example those within the framework of the WTO, are also scrutinised in the light of gender issues;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to focus specifically on the barriers deterring women from accessing top jobs, in order to assess the structural dimension of this phenomenon; welcomes, therefore, measures to help women enter the labour market on an equal par with men and to promote female entrepreneurship and insists on the importance of eliminating existing prejudices and gender discrimination regarding the competitiveness and employability of women, especially in high-level jobs;\n",
        "21. Emphasises the need to address the major democratic deficit related to women's under-representation in political decision-making and calls on the Member States to investigate situations that prevent women's participation in politics and in senior management in public administration at all levels and to take measures to combat such situations;\n",
        "22. Calls for specific attention to be paid to the situation of women belonging to ethnic minorities and of women immigrants, as their marginalisation is reinforced by multiple discrimination from both outside and within their own communities; recommends the adoption of national integrated action plans in order to effectively tackle multiple discrimination, especially where different bodies deal with discrimination issues in a particular Member State;\n",
        "23. Points out the importance of ensuring that immigrants entering the EU are aware of the values and existing laws and social conventions on gender equality in the host countries' societies so as to avoid situations of discrimination which result from a lack of cultural awareness;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to intensify the exchange of best practices on non-discrimination in the labour market in order to foster the equality-efficiency dynamic in respect of national specificities;\n",
        "25. Calls on Member States to develop specific gender equality objectives and targets within the EU Social Inclusion Strategy in order to combat poverty and social exclusion, including a set of policy actions to support non-traditional and one-parent families, and specific policy actions in support of groups of women who are at a high risk of poverty and social exclusion such as migrants, refugees, ethnic minority women, older women and disabled women;\n",
        "26. Urges the Commission to cooperate with Member States to collect relevant data and to enforce measures that could prevent human trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labour;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to focus on instruments and mechanisms for preventing the exploitation of migrant workers, including the recognition and enforcement of fundamental human rights of irregular migrants instead of relying on repression;\n",
        "28. Urges the Member States to mutualise the costs of maternity and parental leave allowances in order to ensure that women no longer represent a more costly source of labour than men;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Member States to combat, in conjunction with both sides of industry, discrimination against pregnant women on the labour market and to take all necessary steps to ensure a high level of protection for mothers; calls on the Commission to make a more detailed assessment of compliance with Community law in this area and to determine whether it needs to be revised;\n",
        "30. Notes with concern that, despite all the progress made, women, especially elderly women and single mothers, are still at risk of exclusion and poverty;\n",
        "31. Calls on Member States and the social partners to pursue the objective of making it possible for all women who seek full-time work to be offered such work rather than part-time jobs, which are often unsafe and insecure;\n",
        "32. Welcomes the Commission's efforts to give new impetus to reaching the targets agreed upon by the 2002 European Council in Barcelona, to eliminating obstacles to the equal participation of women and men in the labour market and to introducing, by 2010, childcare for 90% of children between the age of three and mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under three years old, namely through structural funds; encourages the Commission to present in 2008, as foreseen, a communication setting out further steps to be taken at all levels in order to reach these targets; considers that the aim should be to give all children the right to high-quality care, incorporating an educational element;\n",
        "33. Considers that Member States have a responsibility to ensure that everybody who requires geriatric care or care on grounds of illness or disability has access to high-quality care and treatment;\n",
        "34. Insists on the need to focus policies on combating gender stereotypes in education from an early age, eliminating them from school curricula and textbooks, providing awareness training to teachers and students and encouraging boys and girls to embrace non-traditional educational paths;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission to develop dialogue with, and encourage the media, given their social responsibility, to promote gender equality and avoid the stereotyped portrayal of women and men;\n",
        "36. Recommends the development of pan-European measures to increase awareness of zero tolerance for sexist insults and degrading representations of women in the media and in commercial communication;\n",
        "37. Recommends that different individual needs of girls and boys, in terms of their development, should be taken into account to a greater extent in education, and that, in doing so, stereotypes should be counteracted;\n",
        "38. Considers that the labour market in most EU countries does not adequately reflect higher average educational levels and better academic performance of women;\n",
        "39. Recommends working towards ensuring that school education promotes knowledge and sensible criteria in order to make it possible to achieve freedom, personal autonomy, as well as equity so as to reach social inclusion; further believes that so-called key competences, such as an entrepreneurial attitude and a scientific and technological approach should be reinforced, especially among women;\n",
        "40. Stresses the need for training measures during parental leave in order to cope with changed job requirements;\n",
        "41. Observes the importance of having adequate comparable statistics and, in this context, deplores the invisibility of certain categories of person in European statistics, for example partners working on family farms; calls on EUROSTAT to include this category of person in its statistics;\n",
        "42. Stresses that, in agriculture, women often perform a significant proportion of the work as family workers; considers that this work could also be appropriately taken into account in rural development policy;\n",
        "43. Draws attention to the large number of (mostly female) partners working on family farms, whose legal status is inadequate in many Member States, which can give rise to specific financial and legal problems with regard to access to maternity leave and sick leave, accumulation of pension entitlements and access to social security, as well as in the event of divorce;\n",
        "44. Stresses the need to improve the legal status of women working in agriculture, both in relation to social security, by ensuring that they all have direct access thereto, and in relation to their role on the farms themselves, with particular emphasis on co-ownership of family farms, access to loans, and their rights in the context of inheritance law;\n",
        "45. Emphasises the need for the European Social Fund to support specific measures to improve women's access to and participation in the labour market as well as gender mainstreaming; considers that regional funds should have a gender budget line (gender budgeting) for the funding of measures designed to promote gender equality and surveys assessing the impact of policies relating to the situation of women;\n",
        "46. Recalls that there is a need to incorporate new approaches and innovative instruments into regional development strategies and stresses the need to provide training in gender mainstreaming methodology and tools for decision-makers at regional and local levels; calls on the Commission to further develop its guidelines for the administrative sector on gender mainstreaming for structural fund purposes;\n",
        "47. Asks the Commission to include facts and statistics from acceding and candidate countries in future annual reports on equality between women and men;\n",
        "48. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments of the Member States.\n"
