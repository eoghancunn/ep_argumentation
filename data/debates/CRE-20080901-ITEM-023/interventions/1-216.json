{"speaker": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). - Mr President, first of all I want to join in thanking Nickolay Mladenov for a very important and serious piece of work. His first major report for the Committee on the Internal Market will, I hope, be the first of many. It has been very helpful that he has come in and looked at this issue with fresh eyes, representing citizens who are enjoying new entitlements through their membership of the European Union and who perhaps expect some of these issues to be dealt with better than in the past.\nI want to build on some of the points that a number of my colleagues have made, particularly Diana Wallis and Andrew Schwab. Diana and I have been involved in this area since we came to Parliament in 1999, and therefore understand its importance. I think it is fair to say that if Parliament had not consistently raised these issues with the Commission and said that the motor insurance regime, and particularly its cross-border aspects for mobile motorists, was deeply unsatisfactory, then I do not think that we would be where we are now, anywhere close to the fourth Motor Insurance Directive, and maybe looking for a fifth.\nThis shows how Parliament really can reflect the interests of citizens in what are complex cross-border issues, but ones that do not come into play unless people run into serious problems. People have brought their problems to us, when they have had accidents in other countries and are unable to claim compensation for what are, in many cases, severe or even lifelong injuries.\nI was pleased that the Commissioner, in line with her very strong commitment to consumers and the energy she has brought to this portfolio, wanted to seize this issue. However, I would particularly highlight what Nikolay Mladenov says in his report about the need to step up the level of cooperation between the insurance industry, Member States and the Commission, in order to get better deals under existing legislation. We are acting as a ginger group to put salt and pepper into the system, and I feel we are entitled to a bit more support from the European insurance industry.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). - Mr President, first of all I want to join in thanking Nickolay Mladenov for a very important and serious piece of work.
