        "1.  Stresses that trade liberalisation has a differential impact on women and men, points out the need for coherence between the objectives of the European policy for gender equality and the objectives of trade, development and aid policy with the aim of promoting equality between women and men in these policy areas; stresses that economic participation is key to empowering women and to their overcoming structural discrimination, leading to improved living conditions for women and their families and contributing to the more active involvement of women in politics and the enhancement of social cohesion; one goal being the fair distribution of property, equal rights and economic independence;\n",
        "2.  Notes that, while many women have also benefited from trade liberalisation and foreign direct investment owing to the resulting employment opportunities, liberalisation has contributed to the informalisation of labour relations, the decline in working conditions and the feminisation of employment in entire sectors of the economy;\n",
        "3.  Urges the Commission to approach the international economic institutions with a view to putting in place an action plan for gender mainstreaming in international trade policies, including clear monitoring and evaluating mechanisms; calls for an urgent transformation of existing policies, rules and programmes to instruments and tools that promote gender justice and equality;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Council and the Commission to prioritise the lifting of all reservations to the CEDAW and ratification of its Optional Protocol by all partner states;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the Commission to submit, twice a year, to Parliament's committees responsible for women's rights and for international trade a report co‑signed by the administrators of the donor organisation and beneficiary of financial aid for women in order to prove that the aid has reached its destination and has not been used for purposes other than those initially intended;\n",
        "6.  Stresses the need for studies on the way in which women could benefit fromtrade liberalisation and for systematic collection of gender disaggregated data in order to remedy thegender blindness of current trade policies and policies of global economic institutions; invites the Commission to submit to the Parliament an annual progress report on this subject; recalls that gender analysis must be part and parcel of the sustainability impact assessments of trade agreements presently carried out by the Commission;\n",
        "7.  Asks the Commission to operate a gender impact assessment before concluding any trade agreements with third countries and to introduce effective conditionality clauses with those countries in which human rights, particularly women's rights, are largely violated;\n",
        "8.  Asks the Commission for the formal establishment of a trade and gender desk within its DG Trade, the role of which would include monitoring whether countries with which the EU enjoys trade relations respect human rights, in particular women's rights, and actively to respond to cases of human rights violations;\n",
        "9.  Asks the Commission to analyse production and process methods (PPM, as defined by WTO) from a gender perspective in order to identify the PPM subject to specific gender discrimination, according to CEDAW and the human rights pacts,and to design strategies to provide an incentive for compliance with international standards in exporting countries;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to ensure that European companies profiting from EU market access programmes in the framework of EU cooperation policy do not contribute to the spread ofpractices such as the inhuman exploitation of employees, in particularwomen;\n",
        "11. Stresses that the benefits of employment in the formal and the informal economy depend on a variety of factors, including wages, working conditions and the security of the workplace and women remain discriminated against as regards reaping these benefits; calls, therefore, on the Commission in the context of its development cooperation policyto create a particular fund as part of the future trade and cooperation agreements with third countries to support women in the countries concerned by encouraging their access to credit, education and vocational training with a view to reducing the share/proportion of informal employment; calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament a report co-signed by the donors and beneficiaries, in order to prove that specific funding has not been used for purposes other than those initially intended;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to introduce swiftly the principles of non discrimination and gender equality in the practices of the European Globalisation adjustment Fund (EGF) and to ensure that support deriving from the fund does not replace social security payments;\n",
        "13. Stresses that the high number of job losses in Europe confirms the trend of increasing industrial restructuring; notes that the worst-hit sectors are manufacturing, transport, telecommunications and financial services; calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to take non-discrimination and equality between women and men seriously in regard to the EGF;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to guarantee gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities objectives in all European funds; stresses the need for indications of the progress achieved in promoting equality between men and women and in the fight against all forms of discrimination; calls for a balanced male/female membership of the Monitoring Committee as laid down in Article 35 of General Regulation 1260/1999 on the Structural Funds;\n",
        "15. Calls for the establishment of a yearly ranking of Member States in the promotion of gender equity in the labour market by ensuring decent work for all through compliance with the core labour standards and other ILO conventions; notes that jobs, employment and decent work should be the content of a ninth MDG to be adopted as soon as possible and calls for the inclusion of core labour standards into multilateral and bilateral trade agreements and the inclusion of the principle of gender equality in all MDGs;\n",
        "16. Points out that universal and affordable access to essential services, such as water, education, health, and energy, is a prerequisite for the empowerment of women; stresses, however, that the liberalisation of services in the frame of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) can have a positive impact on this goal only if the GATS principles of national flexibility and policy space are thoroughly upheld in the current bilateral and multilateral negotiations;\n",
        "17. Underlines that TRIPS foresees a revision after two years of its implementation, which has not yet been done, and therefore urges that such a revision take place, based on an impact assessment of the costs of its implementation for developing countries;\n",

        "19. Stresses that gender-related trade distortions resulting from the traditional allocation of women's and men's roles in some countries,  in particular the fact that of women are allocated the task of guaranteeing food safety, water security, and environmental protection, should not be regarded as technical barriers to trade or subordinated to international trade rules;\n",
        "20. Calls for the development of national policy measures that would promote gender equality, protection and promotion of employment, social welfare, improve health and workingconditions of women and men and would contribute to sustainable development; points out the importance of respect for national flexibility and policy space in all trade and development policy negotiations; asks that ensuring the right of developing countries and vulnerable economies to choose whether and which service sectors to open or to exempt from market liberalisation must be ensured;\n",

        "25. Welcomes the Norwegian government's decision to impose by law a 40 % quota for female representation on the boards of joint-stock companies; calls on all Member States to follow the Norwegian example;\n",

        "27. Calls for the \"aid-for-trade\" programmes to be targeted to promote gender equality and sustainable development, financed through additional funds; stresses that \"aid-for-trade\" funding should contribute to the build-up of the supply-side capacity needed to engage in trade, and must not be made conditional upon policies of receiving governments to liberalise agriculture, industry or services markets;\n",
