Therefore, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s report.\nI will carefully consider the main concerns expressed by the rapporteur and by Parliament in relation to the Green Paper. In particular, the form and the scope of the possible Community instrument, the effects of future procedure, the legal condition for granting an attachment order, the compensation of costs and the protection of debtors are important issues that have been highlighted by the rapporteur. I can confirm to you that any proposal or communication in this area will be preceded by an in-depth evaluation and impact assessment, in close cooperation with this Parliament.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Franco Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission . − Madam President, I think the report is an interesting contribution to dealing with a very complex issue: the difficulty of cross-border debt recovery.
