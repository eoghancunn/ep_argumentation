The constant growth of the market in China, which is now beginning to actively produce wine, together with increasing production in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada and South Africa, has resulted in wines from the 'New World' gaining a considerable market share at the expense of European wines.\nI agree with the Commission that supply and demand imbalances in the wine sector, and increasing challenges on European and international wine markets point to the need for reform in this sector as well. However, I completely disagree with some of the solutions proposed in the Commission’s communication of 22 June 2006. The plans for a massive and indiscriminate grubbing-up of vineyards pose a particular threat to the environment, and constitute in my view an unjustified attack on Europe’s wine heritage. Winegrowing, which primarily relies on natural resources, has a positive effect in terms of protecting soil against erosion. As the driving force of rural development, viniculture also holds out the promise of longed-for prosperity for many European regions.\nWith their tradition of viticulture, Slovakia’s regions have focused on promoting enotourism by tapping the potential of the Lesser Carpathian, Kamenínska, Hontianská and Tokaj Wine Routes, and they are now expecting CMO reform in the wine sector to secure the dynamic growth and competitiveness of the European wine sector by allocating adequate financial resources and, above all, through fostering innovation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zita Pleštinská (PPE-DE), in writing . – ( SK ) The EU wine sector produces some of the world’s finest wines and has enormous potential which must be further developed in a sustainable manner.
