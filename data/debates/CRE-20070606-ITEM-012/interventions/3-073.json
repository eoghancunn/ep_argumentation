{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE),", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE), in writing . – I would like to congratulate my colleagues Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok for this report that takes into account three aspects I would like to highlight.\nFirstly, the Constitutional Treaty has sailed on troubled waters. We have the friends of the Constitution, namely the 18 who have ratified it and others for whom ratification would not be a problem. However, we also have friends in trouble: France and the Netherlands. Then we have sceptical friends, the UK, Poland and the Czech Republic.\nTherefore we need leadership. Fortunately there is Chancellor Merkel, whom I wholeheartedly trust.\nSecondly, we need to set up a clear mandate for the IGC leading to a solution before the 2009 elections. The report addresses this.\nThirdly, we want the final Treaty to capture the essential substance of the draft Constitution. These are the institutional innovations, the legal personality, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Foreign Service. I do not care so much about symbols.\nWe need the Constitutional Treaty for the EU to be more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.\nTherefore, I give my full support to this report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE), in writing . – I would like to congratulate my colleagues Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok for this report that takes into account three aspects I would like to highlight.\nFirstly, the Constitutional Treaty has sailed on troubled waters.
