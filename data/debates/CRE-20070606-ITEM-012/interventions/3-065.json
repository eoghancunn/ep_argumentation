{"speaker": "Margot Wallström,", "english": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, two women are always present at our discussions on a new institutional settlement and a new treaty: Mrs Merkel, who represents hope for a way forward, but also Pandora and her box, which we hope will not be opened. You will remember that the one thing that remained in Pandora’s Box was hope. When everything else had escaped from the box, there was still hope. We have to hope for a new settlement. We also have to use the window of opportunity we have right now.\nI was looking at our visitors, our guests and spectators, and wondering what they thought about this debate. Do they think it is a matter of weighing ‘no’ votes against ‘yes’ votes or of us trying to explain why it is so important to maintain the political investment that has gone into finding a way to take European Union decisions in a more efficient, open and transparent way? This is what nobody wants to lose at the moment. We do not want to lose several years of discussions and negotiations and the time invested in this whole process, because we want to give the European Union a stronger voice on the global scene. We want to decide who does what, following the enlargement of the European Union from 15 to 27 Member States within a few years, and we need to decide on the policies, the new challenges facing us on energy, climate and migration.\nIt has to do with the way we work, take decisions and act together. This is what we need to resolve: we are discussing institutional matters because they go hand-in-hand with the policy content.\nWe have invested too much simply to lose it all. We hope that the German Presidency will help us find a solution and we in the Commission are willing to help. We hope that, with everyone’s help, citizens will feel informed and we will have been able both to listen and to explain clearly what we want to do. Together we can do that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission .
