I thank them for their work with this own-initiative report. It comes at a critical time when the members of the Council need to be edged and pushed in a certain way. That requirement is not because of what we here in Parliament want to see with regard to the future development of the European Union, but because of the necessity to ensure that the voices of the peoples of the European Union are properly reflected at all levels of administration and operation of the European Union in the future.\nIf anything, the success of the European Union has been the uniqueness of the institutions predicated upon the basis of consensus, compromise and equality, and the need to maintain that kind of balance to ensure that it does not become a two-tier Europe; to ensure that Donald Rumsfeld’s notion of an old and a new Europe will never come to fruition. Rather, we need a Europe working together, le chéile, and cooperating together for the benefit of all the peoples.\nHowever, our primary source must be the agreed text that we already have. Let us look at the uniqueness of the Convention that came up with that text. Let us ensure that we maintain the core of that text whilst at the same time making the necessary adjustments to guarantee that all Member States can agree and sign up to it and that none feel threatened by it.\nOur task today is to ensure that the message goes out loud and clear that Parliament supports future developments of the European Treaty that rightly reflect the new Member States and rightly reflect the balances that must be maintained for the successful operation of a Europe of nations of equality.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Brian Crowley, thar ceann an Ghrúpa UEN . – A Uachtaráin, maidir le bunreacht nua a chruthú don Aontas Eorpach, tá sé an-thábhachtach go dtabharfar cluas éisteachta do shaoránaigh uilig an Aontais.
