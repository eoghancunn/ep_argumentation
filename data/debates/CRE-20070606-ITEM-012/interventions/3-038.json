{"speaker": "Richard Corbett (PSE). –", "english": "Richard Corbett (PSE). – Madam President, Mr Allister has just said that the word ‘no’ is not difficult to understand, but equally the word ‘yes’ is not difficult to understand. We are in a situation where a large majority of Member States have said yes. Two have said no, some have a few reservations, but all 27 have agreed to embark on a process of trying to bridge that gap, of trying to find a solution capable of ratification by all 27. This report, which I commend and my group will be supporting, endorses that attempt. We think it is right to make an attempt to bridge that gap and to find a solution capable of ratification by all 27.\nThis Parliament, elected by the citizens of the European Union, approved the Constitutional Treaty in adopting by an overwhelming majority the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and myself two years ago. So it is quite natural that we side with the 22 Member States who wish to keep the text as intact as possible. I think that is quite logical. This Parliament would prefer changes of form to sacrificing the content. It would prefer to relinquish the symbols rather than the substance. That is clear and that will no doubt be part of the solution, but it is unlikely to be enough. The issues of the substance of the Constitution will have to be addressed in some cases, perhaps to improve, extend or revise it. But it is essential that we try to keep those practical reforms in the Constitutional Treaty, and it is a collection of very practical reforms – those reforms that make the EU capable of functioning as it continues to enlarge and that improve its democratic accountability. Those are essential and must be kept. The Constitutional Treaty contains such a package of reforms. Let us do our utmost to salvage as many of those reforms as possible.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard Corbett (PSE). – Madam President, Mr Allister has just said that the word ‘no’ is not difficult to understand, but equally the word ‘yes’ is not difficult to understand.
