From that starting point we should seek a compromise that takes into account three factors.\nThe first is the concerns of those countries that have rejected it, and the concerns of those countries that have still not ratified it. The second is that we should take into account some mistakes that we may have made – and yes, we may have made some mistakes along the way. For instance, we may have gone too fast and too far in signing a constitution just five months after the greatest and biggest enlargement of the European Union, or by appearing too ambitious not least by the designation of the Treaty as a Constitution when originally our mandate was a mere simplification.\nThirdly and finally, the point we should take into account is that the compromise must also take into account the new reality in which we live and the new challenges that we face and which may not have been sufficiently taken into account by the Constitution. I have in mind, for instance, a common immigration policy and a common approach to climate change. Yes, the Germany Presidency, and the Portuguese Presidency after it, have a fine balancing act to strike and we wish them luck.
