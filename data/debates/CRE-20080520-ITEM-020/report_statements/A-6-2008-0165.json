    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Draws the attention of the Member States to the fact that education systems in Europe continue to sustain gender stereotypes, in particular in areas of research such as the natural sciences;\n",
        "2.  Believes that it is of the utmost importance to promote science as an interesting field for both sexes from early on; urges that this be taken into account when planning educational material and in teacher training; encourages universities and faculties to analyse their entrance selection systems in order to identify possible implicit gender discrimination and correct the selection system accordingly;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission and Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure that women’s contribution is not excluded in publications on the history of science and technology, not just because this is a clear case of discrimination but also because the absence of role models may harm efforts to increase the presence of women in such fields;\n",
        "4.  Notes that an excessively high proportion of women scientists give up their careers at some point; considers that this pattern, which has often been described as the ‘leaking pipeline’ model, needs to be analysed on the basis of various models including the ‘push and pull factors’ model; calls on the competent authorities to take account of various factors such as working environment, occupational stereotypes, competition, mobility requirements and family responsibilities when formulating possible solutions;\n",
        "5.  Notes that the conventional approach to evaluating 'excellence' and 'performance', inter alia as regards number of publications, may not begender neutral, but is restrictive and fails to take account of the resources available, such as funds, space, equipment and staff, and of the qualities essential in any researcher, such as the ability to organise and hold together a research team or to train young members of the team;\n",
        "6.  Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take due account, in the definitions of excellence and a 'good researcher', of the differences between male and female scientific careers; stresses that female researchers alsocontribute to the world of research with different perspectives and choices of research topics;\n",
        "7.  Regrets that the breaks women take in scientific careers for family reasons have a negative impact on their career opportunities, as most male colleagues do not take breaks and thus can achieve comparative positions at a younger age and gain an advantage in their further careers; asks, therefore, that age be taken into account as a criterion for excellence together with family situation, including the number of the researcher's dependents; calls, furthermore, for all European research bodies and universities to set up grants for doctoral studies in accordance with national maternity leave provisions;\n",
        "8.  Points out that age limits for the award of grants adversely affect young people looking after dependants, and that these are, for the most part, women; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that, in such circumstances, legislative measures are in place to correct this anomaly, such as adding one year to the deadline for applications for each year in which a dependant is looked after;\n",
        "9.  Notes that mobility is one of the crucial ways of developing and assuring research career advancement and notes that this can be difficult to reconcile with family life and that appropriate policy measures should therefore be taken to make it more viable;\n",
        "10. Stresses the role of infrastructure in facilitating a sustainable work-life balance, as well as the importance of enhancing the security of scientific careers;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to improve the situation by means of integration of the family angle through possibilities for flexible working hours, improved child-care facilities and social security provision accessibility across the borders; calls for parental leave conditions that genuinely allow men and women freedom of choice; stresses that reconciling family life and work is a responsibility for both men and women;\n",
        "12. Notes that, while current recruitment processes tend to maintain the status quo in terms of favouring the employment of male researchers, more open and transparent recruitment procedures would enhance the chances of the qualities that tend to be more prevalent in women scientists being equally recognised and valued;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Member States to analyse the factors discouraging women’s presence in senior posts in universities and education authorities, seriously reducing their influence in decision-making in research within the European Union, and to propose appropriate solutions;\n",
        "14. Encourages universities, research institutes and private businesses to adopt and enforce equality strategies in their organisations and to conduct gender impact evaluation in their decision-making processes;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission for awareness-raising actions in the scientific community, as well as among policy makers on the issue of equal opportunities in science and research;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission and the Member States for more transparent recruitment processes and for an obligation to ensure gender balance in evaluation panels, selection and all othercommittees, as well as nominated panelsandcommitteeswith a non-binding targetof at least 40% women and at least 40% men;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to ensure that attention is given to the participation of women in scientific research programmes by providing targeted gender-awareness training for those in decision-making positions, sitting on advisory boards and evaluation panels, drafting invitations to tender as well as tenders, and leading contract negotiations;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission to ensure that in tenders submitted under FP7 a balanced representation of men and women is assessed positively; urges Member States to make the same arrangements in their national and regional programmes;\n",
        "19. Considers Gender Action Plans within the proposal and evaluation stage of FP7 to be an essential part of the overall gender mainstreaming strategy and gender equality policy of the European Union; finds, therefore, that they should remain an integral part of European research funding;\n",
        "20. Call on the Commission, as far as FP7 is concerned, to report to Parliament regularly on progress in the representation of women on assessment boards and selection committees; calls on the Commission to include the gender aspect in interim assessments and progress reports relating to FP7, and for a mid-term evaluation of the gender mainstreaming tools in FP7;\n",
        "21. Firmly believes that specific recruitment, training and public relations measures need to be introduced in order to promote and encourage greater participation on the part of women in fields such as technologies, physics, engineering, computer science and other domains which are still, regrettably, dominated by men;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take positive action to encourage female researchers and for further development of support and mentoring schemes, as well as promotion policies with clear objectives; notes that the development of support structures for career guidance and the provision of advice addressed, inter alia, to female scientists would produce particularly positive results; also notes, however, that measures such as obligatory targets for female researchers and professors are essential to achieving gender balance in science;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to introduce effective policies to eliminate the gender pay gap; notes that in the field of science the principle of equal pay should also apply to scholarships and stipends;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide for research funds targeted at women to counter the underfunding of women in research;\n",
        "25. Stresses the importance of encouraging girls to take up scientific careers and suggests that the Commission and the Member States do so by promoting female researchers as role models and adopting and implementing other measures conducive to achieving this aim;\n",
        "26. Encourages Member States to promote awareness-raising actions to inform and encourage girls to pursue scientific and technological university studies and degrees; encourages Member States to improve knowledge-sharing processes, since very different patterns of education choices are available in the different Member States;\n",
        "27. Draws attention to the need for special programmes at universities increasing young girls' and women's interest in starting scientific careers;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to set up programmes for coaching and supporting young women scientists in participating in research programmes and grant applications in order to help them to stay in academia and research;\n",
        "29. Welcomes the activities carried out by the European Platform of Women Scientists, which aim to enhance the participation of women in science and increase the number of women scientists in decision-making positions;\n",
        "30. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to strengthen networking further among female scientists at national, regional and EU level, because networking has been identified as an essential tool by which to empower women, in order to attract more women to scientific careers, and encourage female scientists to participate in the policy debate and enhance their professional advancement;\n",
        "31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and to the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States.\n"
