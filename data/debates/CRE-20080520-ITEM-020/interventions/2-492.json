{"speaker": "Stavros Dimas,", "english": "Stavros Dimas, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers in tonight’s debate for their very positive contributions. The Commission policy on gender in research has two main strands – women’s participation in research and the gender dimension of research. In the first we try to tackle the presence of women at all levels of the career ladder and the gender differences in various principal areas. In the second strand, we focus on research design and the account taken of gender diversity in research. The Commission is as committed as ever to the promotion of gender equality in research.\nAs regards the quotas, we believe that targets such as the 40% target for each gender for various expert groups, and evaluation panels in the Seventh Framework Programme, are objective and balanced ones and are bringing good results. We will continue to strive to reach these objectives and we hope to increase the number of women in science this way. Our endeavours are already bringing results and I would like to thank you for your support in our efforts on improving the situation for better inclusion of women in science and research.\nThank you very much for your comments and good cooperation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stavros Dimas, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers in tonight’s debate for their very positive contributions.
