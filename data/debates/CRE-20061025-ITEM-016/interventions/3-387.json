{"speaker": "Jacques Barrot,", "english": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Wortmann-Kool on this excellent report. The Resolution shows that there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the promotion of inland waterway transport. Inland waterway transport is safe, low-polluting and energy efficient, and offers great reserve capacities. Despite the advantages it offers, inland waterway transport is under-used: it represents scarcely 6% of the total overland goods transport in the Union, even though, in a few Member States, its modal share stands at 40%.\nToday, Europe has 36 000 km of inland waterways. We are talking here about a genuine trans-European network. We need a European approach in order to promote this mode of transport. It can achieve a far greater modal share if, as you just pointed out, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, our approach is accompanied by concrete action.\nI am grateful to Parliament for the support that it has given me via this report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool. I am going to confine myself, Mr President, to a few remarks about the main points, starting with the improvement of market conditions. We must develop new multi-modal, innovative services, so as to enable inland waterway transport to play its role among the large seaports and the big cities in the Hinterland. More than 70% of the inland navigation sector is made up of small businesses, often owner-boatmen. We need to create conditions that will help strengthen their position in the market: for example, improved access to funds through the removal of any regulatory and administrative barriers and clear indications as to what State aid is available. The Commission is going to start work on State aid for this sector. These guidelines will be published in 2008-2009. That is all I have to say on market conditions.\nAs regards the modernisation of the fleet, inland waterway transport must improve its logistical efficiency and its performance in relation to the environment and safety. Innovations must be focused on the construction of boats – for example, the engine and the propulsion system – and on information and communication technologies for what are known as river information services. A regulatory framework already exists, but we must ensure that the system is actually implemented. That also applies to the standards applicable to fuel intended for inland navigation. Stricter standards, which we should propose by the end of the year, will enable us to further improve the environmental quality of inland waterway transport.\nI now come to the promotion of employment and skills. Inland waterway transport suffers from a dearth of crews and a worsening shortage of candidates to take over businesses. The strategy must be focused on an improvement to onboard working and living conditions and on professional training. I plan to propose harmonising the requirements relating to crew members and to boatmasters’ certificates in 2008 via the mutual recognition procedure.\nWith regard to the image of waterway transport, we must correct the one that inland navigation currently suffers from. We must make people aware of the real potential of inland navigation by implementing a network to promote inland waterway transport, as exists in certain regions.\nWith regard to waterway infrastructure, there are, within the network, bottlenecks that curb the competitiveness of inland waterway transport. We must therefore remove the existing obstacles. That is primarily a responsibility of the Member States, but the Community can help thanks to the trans-European networks. In this context, the Commission prioritises the development of the two major waterway routes: the Rhine-Meuse-Danube route and the Seine-Scheldt link.\nIn the new financial regulation submitted for Parliament’s approval, we have proposed a 30% rate of support for the waterway projects and the inclusion of these projects in the multi-annual programme. I hope that the Council, like Parliament, will support our proposals. The contribution of intelligent transport systems is vital. We are preparing to implement river information services, by which, in practical terms, we mean a system for managing information concerning inland waterway transport, which will enable boatmen to plan their journeys better, to reduce the time they wait at locks and to constantly monitor transport.\nMrs Wortmann-Kool, you mentioned the appointment of a TEN coordinator. I must say that we welcomed the positive results obtained by the six coordinators who have already been appointed. Mr Costa, for his part, has also called for the appointment of a coordinator for both inland waterway transport and maritime transport. I can tell you that my intention is indeed to select two coordinators over the next few weeks.\nThe NAIADES programme provides for a range of very different actions: harmonised legislation, strategic promotion and coordination measures. All of these actions will only be effective, however, if the institutional framework is suitable. The fact is that, today, we are faced with fragmented resources and efforts spread over different levels. We therefore need to adapt the framework to the demands of an enlarged European market. We are in the process of analysing different options. The results of this analysis will be discussed with all of the parties concerned, with the Member States and with the international river commissions.\nTo conclude, we need this NAIADES programme to be a success and, to that end, we need to be able to rely on the support of decision-makers at every level: national and regional authorities, river commissions and businesses. I am grateful to Parliament and to you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for sending out, with this report, a strong signal in favour of the promotion of inland navigation, which Europe needs now more than ever.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission .
