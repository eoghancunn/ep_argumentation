{"speaker": "Jacques Barrot,", "english": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by echoing what was said in this excellent debate and by thanking all of the speakers. Inland navigation is not, as you said, an added extra. It is a genuine option, and we need modes of transport other than roads in today's Europe. I am therefore fully determined, just as determined as your rapporteur and yourselves. Nevertheless, you are right: we cannot just make declarations; we need to act. I am therefore going to provide you with a few answers.\nLet us begin by focusing on the innovation fund: the Commission services, together with representatives of the profession and the Member States, are currently looking into the possibility of creating a fund for innovation in the field of inland waterway transport. This fund would be an important instrument for implementing the NAIADES programme. We are examining different options, such as how this fund can be sustained by the inland navigation sector, the Union and the Member States. The Commission will draft a report on the state of play and on the results of the assessments in 2007. You did in fact place great emphasis on this innovation fund, Mrs Wortmann-Kool.\nOn the issue of pollution from ships, it is true, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that we must think about reducing the level of sulphur in the fuel used for inland navigation purposes, but we must not go too far. The idea is to bring this level of sulphur down to the level of the diesel fuel used in road transport. This reduction in the sulphur level is key to reducing air pollution. We are carrying out a review of the directives on air pollution with the aim of substantially reducing this sulphur level. However, I have taken full note of what you said about the investments required to that end.\nMrs Lichtenberger, you asked me about the monitoring of dangerous transport. On this point, I should like to make it clear to you that a proposal is currently the subject of an interservice consultation and is due to be adopted before the end of the year. As a general rule, the improvement of infrastructure, Mr Meijer, will be accompanied by impact studies, in order to reduce as far as possible any harmful effects of infrastructure works.\nGenerally speaking, I would say to all of the speakers that infrastructure obviously requires investment. This investment is the responsibility of the Member States. Nevertheless, it is true – and I am addressing you, in particular, Mrs Ayala – that we have proposed in the financial regulation to prioritise inland waterway transport by providing for a 30% cap. May I call for Parliament’s help, Mr President, in adopting this financial regulation? I am well aware that there is some reluctance on the part of the Member States, but I am sure that Parliament will give priority to the inland waterways.\nThere are undoubtedly other solutions to propose, but my aim with these few answers was to tell you that my intention was obviously to act. As you pointed out, we, in Europe, have several magnificent waterways, such as the Danube, and I have taken note of your comments about the need to involve all those who live along the Danube. I must say that we are aware, Mr Rack, of the importance of these waterways and of the major role that they can play in the future.\nThat, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you, in the hope that we can carry out this crucial work together and accord Europe’s waterways the full importance they deserve.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission .
