    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Recognises that the European transport system is increasingly confronted with capacity problems, leading to congestion and delays, and that inland waterway transport can help reduce congestion, improve freight transport safety, contribute to better energy efficiency and protect the environment;\n",
        "2.   Supports, therefore, the initiative of the Commission to establish an integrated European action programme for inland waterway transport: NAIADES (Navigation and inland waterway action and development in Europe);\n",
        "3.   Invites the Member States to further develop national policies to stimulate inland waterway transport (IWT), taking into account the European Action Programme, and to encourage regional, local and port authorities and industries to do likewise;\n",
        "4.   Emphasizes that existing markets should be consolidated, in particular by making infrastructure more reliable and better integrated across the whole supply chain;\n",
        "5.   Stresses that links with the new EU Member States in Eastern and Central Europe and also with Romania and Bulgaria must be developed and brought into line with current technology, which means that additional infrastructure measures must be considered and measures relating to intermodality and interoperability taken;\n",
        "6.   Stresses the need to develop opportunities for innovative multi-modal services, to build new markets in which cooperation among IWT operators and users, national and regional authorities will be essential;\n",
        "7.   Calls on the Commission and the Member States, in view of the sector's consisting mainly of small businesses, to improve access to finance, and especially risk capital, for start-ups, fully taking into account, when planning and carrying out relevant measures, the sector's specific structure;\n",
        "8.   Fully supports in this regard the Commission's initiative to provide sources of information on the subject of financing, for example a funding handbook containing a list of European, national and regional aid instruments for IWT, covering, if appropriate, funding from the European Investment Fund;\n",
        "9.   Asks the Commission to publish as soon as possible State aid guidelines for inland waterway transport support schemes and to adopt de minimis rules that take due account of the needs of the inland navigation sector;\n",
        "10. Welcomes the Commission’s plan to screen existing bottlenecks at national and European level that hamper the development of IWT; calls for all public and private parties involved to contribute to this screening, to examine potential solutions and look for best practices, with the results of the screening being taken into account when drafting future legislation or taking new measures;\n",
        "11. Stresses that administrative bottlenecks should be removed and procedures simplified, in particular by making optimal use of e-communication and by establishing one-stop-shops; believes that specific attention should be paid to procedures in sea and inland ports as well as to legislation on the environment, waste and food safety that leads to the disruption of logistics processes;\n",
        "12. Points out that the reliability of the waterway network and the availability of multi-functional (inland) ports is the most important condition for the further development of IWT, above all as a part of multimodal freight transport chains, and for the sector in technical and economic respects and emphasizes the particular responsibility of Member States to increase their efforts to ensure adequate and reliable infrastructure, whilst taking into account environmental risks and aspects;\n",
        "13. Points to the importance of River Information Services to contributing to a more efficient and safer use of the inland waterway network and its links with other modes of transport; calls upon the Commission and the Member States to include RIS as part of the multi-annual indicative programme of TEN-T and to fully tap the potential of RIS for achieving sustainable logistics;\n",
        "14. Points to the need to integrate the waterway system with maritime navigation by developing access to the sea, improving interfaces between inland waterway and maritime systems, and investing in new combined inland waterway and seagoing vessels, including vessels of innovative design;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission, in cooperation with Member States and any third countries involved, to draw up a European Development Plan which should contain an up-to-date inventory of the infrastructure on European inland waterways and to provide more information on waterways in need of maintenance and other structural improvements to infrastructure; also calls on the Commission, in doing so, to make use of the existing findings of scientific studies and expert reports in the Member States;\n",
        "16. Calls upon the Commission to designate as soon as possible, and by the end of 2006 at the latest, a European TEN-T coordinator for IWT to support the implementation of the IWT TEN-T priority projects, drawing on experience with existing coordinators;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to give a higher prefential rate of at least 20% to all inland waterway projects of common interest and to give greater priority to inland waterways projects of common interest in the multi-annual TEN-T program;\n",
        "18. Calls upon Member States to consider the IWT potential in land use planning and in economic policies at federal, regional and local levels so as to actively encourage the development of waterside commercial and logistic sites, taking into account sustainable transport and job creation in industry and distribution, and to pay special attention to small waterways which have an unexploited potential to enhance freight mobility;\n",
        "19. Recalls the need to lay down in 2007 stricter Community limits for SOx, PM, NOx and CO2emissions, in particular by promoting low-sulphur fuel; calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide incentives to accelerate the introduction and use of fuel efficient and environmentally friendly engines in inland waterway transport in order to improve its energy-efficiency;\n",
        "20. Acknowledging that emissions are closely linked to the quality of the fuel available on the market, invites the Commission to submit as soon as possible a proposal setting stricter standards for inland shipping fuels;\n",
        "21. Invites the Commission to submit in 2007 a proposal for a European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund for the financing of new demand-based investments and innovative concepts of European interest in the area of logistics, technology and the environment requiring cross border cooperation and interoperability, a Fund that, as a key instrument of the NAIADES Action Programme, should be financed as to one third by the sector (the existing Inland Waterway [reserve] Fund, created under Regulation (EC) No 718/1999), as a means of co-financing, for another third by the EU and the remaining third by the Member States and, further, to draw up, in close cooperation with the sector, the conditions under which the fund should be established; points out that support for information offices should be considered as an option;\n",
        "22. Stresses the need to encourage the development of clean and efficient vessels under the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development. Points, in this respect, to developments in vessel construction for use on different kinds of waters, including limited draught, which can promote IWT even on waters with low or variable water levels, without harming the natural environment; considers, in this connection, that there should be a particular focus on information and communication technologies and the design, eco-efficiency and equipment of vessels;\n",
        "23. Recognises that the shortage of entrepreneurs and staff is becoming a problem for the IWT sector, given the aging of current personnel and a lack of appeal to newcomers;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to continue their efforts to harmonise manning requirements and boat masters' certificates, and to promote the mutual recognition of qualifications, e.g. via the European Qualifications Framework (EQF);\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission, the River Commissions and the Member States to develop, in cooperation with the sector, modern and market-oriented training programmes for the sector, where possible using common training standards, also cooperating with maritime training programmes such as \"Leadership\", to attract newcomers to work in an international environment and to offer attractive career perspectives;\n",
        "26. Stresses the importance of enforcing existing social legislation, to safeguard good working conditions;\n",
        "27. Notes there is still a lack of awareness of the possibilities of carriage of goods by IWT in particular as regards the flexibility and sustainability potential of IWT;\n",
        "28. Recognises that, in order for it to be fully utilised and successful, the economic value of and possibilities for IWT need to be explained and advertised; calls therefore for support for existing IWT promotion offices and the creation of new ones in Member States with IWT potential, which can advise and encourage transport users to use inland shipping, and for support for authorities in the identification of problems and definition of policies;\n",
        "29. Proposes that this European network for promoting IWT should be integrated into a European network for promoting intermodality, using existing structures and experience gained in promoting other modes of transport, in particular such as already exist at European level in relation to promoting short sea shipping;\n",
        "30. Calls on the Member States and stakeholders concerned, in the absence of dedicated Community funding, to undertake to ensure the financial sustainability of this network;\n",
        "31. Notes the importance of a European Market Observation System involving all actors, providing comparable market information, notably to allow timely and responsible investment decisions, to identify strong and weak points and to discover possible new markets;\n",
        "32. Points out that the growth and prosperity of IWT must be the focal point for future discussions on the institutional framework; stresses, in this connection, that it is important to take account of the existing competences of all relevant parties, to make use of the expertise of international organisations and to avoid additional bureaucracy;\n",
        "33. Calls for intensified and enhanced cooperation between the River Commissions and the Community, to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding, containing at least the following:\n",
