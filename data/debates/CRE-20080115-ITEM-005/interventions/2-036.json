{"speaker": "Stephen Hughes (PSE). –", "english": "Stephen Hughes (PSE). – Madam President, I would like to speak about needlestick injuries, because I was responsible for the 2006 report on this issue. I wonder whether the Commissioner would agree with me that, where a risk is identified that needs to be tackled at European level, then there is a need for the Commission to ask expeditiously.\nIf he does agree, I wonder whether he can explain why it took a full year for the Commission to manage and assess the first round of consultation with the social partners on needlestick injuries, even though there were only 10 responses in that consultation.\nI wonder whether he can also assure us that work on this issue will proceed faster in the year ahead. One million workers a year are affected by needlestick injuries. That means around one and half million will have been affected since the report was completed by Parliament. Could the Commission please act a little faster in future?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stephen Hughes (PSE). – Madam President, I would like to speak about needlestick injuries, because I was responsible for the 2006 report on this issue.
