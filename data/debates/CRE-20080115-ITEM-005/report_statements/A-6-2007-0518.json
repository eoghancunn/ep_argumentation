    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the Commission's ambitious target for an average of a 25% reduction in workplace accidents across the EU; recognises that the figure may vary from country to country due to differing points of departure, but considers that it is still important to have clear and well-targeted measures together with a timetable and financial commitments which can then be measured and assessed; in the absence of these, calls on the Commission to undertake to report back to the European Parliament at the half-way stage of the strategy's period on its progress;\n",
        "2.   Calls on the Commission and Member States to take due account of inequalities not just between Member States but also within individual Member States, and to make a commitment to reducing them;\n",
        "3.   Notes the Commission's proposals to use non-binding instruments where binding laws are not feasible or appropriate, allowing Member States the flexibility to find solutions that deliver the best health and safety outcomes in their particular circumstances;\n",
        "4.   Welcomes the Commission's greater emphasis on regulatory simplification and reduction of administrative burdens, and points out that while simplification provides enhanced benefits to citizens, it helps employers and employees alike to concentrate on the practical management of health and safety to secure better health and safety outcomes; considers it to be of paramount importance that such simplification in no way undermines the level of protection offered to workers;\n",
        "5.   Calls on the Commission to give priority in its strategy to those activities and/or industries which involve particular risks (e.g. metal-working, construction, electricity, forestry etc.);\n",
        "6.   Calls on the Commission to involve the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work in Bilbao more closely in this process, and in particular to ask it to submit an assessment of which industries have the highest risk of industrial accidents and occupational diseases and how this can be effectively counteracted;\n",
        "7.  Considers the Commission's strong focus on assisting SMEs to meet their health and safety obligations to be excellent and fully supports its approach;\n",
        "8.  Regrets that the Communication is silent on targets for the reduction of occupational diseases but understands the difficulty in measuring occupational diseases; therefore calls on the Commission to review the use and implementation of existing statistical procedures in order to correctly identify and measure occupational diseases, and in particular occupational cancers with a view to setting targets for their reduction; suggests that the Commission considers the option of transforming the EU recommendation concerning occupational diseases (2003/670) into a minimum directive;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission to broaden the Community strategy's scope so that it also covers social determinants and not merely occupational accidents or illnesses, given that an individual's state of health is determined by various work-related factors such as type of contract, working conditions and the availability of work; points out that changes in work relations and the decline in job security give rise also to environmental, psychological and social problems that need to be addressed;\n",
        "10. Emphasises the need to mainstream gender when dealing with issues concerning health and safety at work and welcomes the initiative of the Commission calling for the preparation of unique methods of impact assessment in OSH with regard to gender specificity; however, criticises the Commission for failing to take adequate account of gender mainstreaming in its communication, either in its \"Objectives of the Community Strategy 2007-2012\" or in any its \"Impact Assessments\"[11];\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission to assess the availability of gender-disaggregated statistics at Community level on work-related fatal and non-fatal diseases;\n",
        "12. Urges the Member States to implement existing OSH directives in a more gender-sensitive way and to implement gender impact assessment of these directives;\n",
        "13. Stresses that the rehabilitation and reintegration of workers after ill health or an accident at work is vital and applauds the special focus on rehabilitation and reintegration called for in the national strategies; it is important that governments ensure in their health and safety strategies the obligation of job retention (through training, reallocation of tasks, etc) for people who have experienced a physical or mental illness during their working lives;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission to collect more figures and data on workers with chronic diseases and to analyse their working conditions and to draw up a charter for the protection of the rights of cancer patients and people with other chronic diseases in the workplace and, with a view to requiring companies to make it possible for patients to continue in employment during their treatment and to return to the employment market after it has finished;\n",
        "15. Expresses deep concern regarding the excessively high rate of accidents among temporary, short-term and low-qualified workers, which in some Member States is at least double that of permanent workers, while recognising the correlation between these employment categories and their employment in higher risk industries such as construction; points out that Council Directive 91/383/EEC of 25 June 1991 supplementing the measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment relationship establishes as a general rule that temporary workers have the same occupational health rights as other workers but that the directive fails to lay down specific mechanisms to make this principle workable in practice; calls on the Commission to address these shortcomings as a matter of urgency;\n",
        "16. Also notes the increasing number of atypical employment contracts and stresses that their conditions must not pose risks to the health and safety of employees and contractors;\n",
        "17. Asks for measures to observe the safety and health rights for women in atypical workplaces such as those who care for sick people at home;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to fully take account of the implications of demographic change on occupational health and safety; in particular, invites them to reinforce preventive measures and to adopt measures intended to compensate physical decline, notably through ergonomics and workplace design, and through measures and incentives designed to maintain the motivation, capacities and health of ageing workers;\n",
        "19. Notes the scientifically proven link between growing stress at the workplace and the diseases it gives rise to, particularly chronic illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and musculoskeletal disorders;\n",
        "20. Considers that it is of the utmost importance to ensure better application of the existing legal instruments on OHS and therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to use all available means in order to achieve this; measures to be considered should include: a)      minimum requirements for the quality of preventive services and work inspection, b)     tougher sanctions, c)      better assessments of legislative implementation, d)     exchange of best practice, e)      strengthening the culture of prevention and early warning systems including broadened access of society to information for occupational and safety conditions at the work place, f)      greater involvement of employees in the workplace, g)      stimulating the employers to fulfil their engagements in the field of occupational safety and health at work, h)      strengthening the use of social dialogue agreements;\n",
        "21. Considers that the Commission is severely lacking in resources in order to properly check the effective transposition and implementation of adopted directives on occupational safety; considers it should make use of all available means at its disposal, including a more widespread use of infringement proceedings;\n",
        "22. Notes that OHS protection should apply equally to all workers in the European Union, that OHS protection is ultimately founded on the fundamental right to physical integrity, and that opt-outs from OHS protection legislation jeopardise the health of workers and equal opportunities, and may trigger a race to the bottom;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to give the same commitment to impact assessments on health and safety at work as to those on the environment;\n",
        "24. Considers labour inspections to be an essential part of implementing health and safety legislation; therefore calls on the Commission to: a)      provide SLIC with the necessary resources to ensure it can perform effectively, following an examination of how it can be best effective and provide the best value, b)     further develop knowledge sharing systems to ensure effective responses to requests for information and cooperation, c)      initiate evaluation research on the efficiency and impact of inspection activities as proposed by the SLIC, with a view to putting into place common quantitative and qualitative inspection objectives, thereby encouraging the use of inspectorates as facilitators in creating an efficient and effective health and safety culture throughout the workforce, d)     introduce ways and means of evaluating national inspection systems, notably by setting scoreboards, and calls on Member States to: e)      provide adequate staff and financial resources for their national inspectorates, f)      increase the density of labour inspectors, to ensure at the very least a ratio of 1 to 10000 workers, in line with ILO recommendations, g)      increase the quality of labour inspectors through providing more multi-disciplinary training in areas such as psychology, ergonomics, hygiene, environmental risks and toxicology, h)      focus inspections on priority areas, sectors and undertakings with high risks of accidents and with high levels of vulnerable groups such as migrant workers, temporary agency workers, low-skilled, young and ageing workers and workers with disabilities;\n",
        "25. Recognises that prevention is of central importance and calls upon the Commission to implement the following measures in the strategy: a)      ensure that employers recognise and fulfil their responsibilities in providing appropriate preventive services in all workplaces, while acknowledging that a responsible attitude from employees to their own health and safety is also important, b)     encourage prevention services to be fully multidisciplinary and reflect the hierarchy of measures provided for in the framework Directive 89/391/EEC, c)      stress that risk assessment should be a continuous ongoing process and not a one-off obligation, with full involvement of the employee, d)     ensure that as far as possible preventive activities are carried out in-house, e)      ensure that health surveillance goes hand in hand with prevention, f)      adapt its health and safety at work legislation on a regular basis to reflect technological advances;\n",
        "26. Underlines the importance of Member States ensuring that access to technical documents and norms concerning health and safety at the work place on national level is free of charge;\n",
        "27. Congratulates the Commission on its proposals on education and training contained in its Communication and considers this to be a key factor in developing a preventive culture and that furthermore it should be a continuous and ongoing process adapted to the new technological situation at the workplace, which also applies to those workers that return to the workforce after illness or career breaks due to family care responsibilities;\n",
        "28. Considers that tailored vocational training and retraining in the field of health and safety at work must be offered to employees and health and safety representatives with specific attention paid to sub-contracting, temporary work, part-time work, women, and migrant workers; national and EU funds must continue to be used in this respect;\n",
        "29. Considers that employers should be obliged to facilitate medical examinations for day workers and people with part-time employment contracts;\n",
        "30. Calls on the Commission to fully use the existing Community funds (notably the ESF) on issues related to H&S (prevention and development of a prevention culture, awareness raising, vocational training, lifelong learning, rehabilitation and reintegration of workers having suffered from an occupational accident or disease) and addressed in particular to SMEs; Other Community funds (for example, from the 7thFramework Programme on Research) and national funds should be allocated to research on occupational diseases;\n",
        "31. Considers it important, bearing in mind the increased risk to which workers are exposed in the mining, metallurgical, steelmaking and shipbuilding sectors, for the Member States and the Commission to allocate the requisite funds for the necessary investments to guarantee health and safety at work;\n",
        "32. Asks the Member States and the Commission to ensure a systematic gender-sensitive approach, when developing national and Community OHS strategies and when collecting statistics, conducting surveys and carrying out OHS research; calls on the Member States and the Commission to make use of the funding possibilities provided in this regard by the PROGRESS programme, in particular under the section concerning gender equality;\n",
        "33. Invites the Member States to assess the adoption of financial incentives to promote H&S in the work place, notably tax rebates or preference in call for tenders for safe enterprises and H&S certified businesses, introduction of a \"bonus-malus\" system in insurance policies and social security contributions, and financial incentives to replace obsolete or unsafe equipment;\n",
        "34. Furthermore, suggests that Member States consider the possibility of incorporating certain health and safety standards when awarding public contracts;\n",
        "35. Considering the ongoing social and economic changes, which influence and change also the labour market, calls on the Commission to encourage good employment policies and decent work conditions and to encourage employers to promote healthy lifestyles at the workplace through occupational health promotion campaigns, enforcement of smoking bans at the workplace and schemes to support smoking employees to quit smoking and to ensure responsibility and policy coherence with other areas, especially public health;\n",
        "36. Calls on the Commission to initiate a revision of Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and women who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding;\n",
        "37. Considers that the health problems related to exposure to asbestos are well known and that the European regulation on asbestos is acceptable; underlines the fact that asbestos-initiated diseases in Europe are forecasted to be very high for many years ahead; therefore calls on the Commission to organise a hearing on how to tackle the huge OHS problems related to existing asbestos in buildings and other constructions such as ships, trains and machinery; also calls on Member States to draw up national action plans on phasing out asbestos, including obligations to map asbestos in buildings and provide for the safe removal of asbestos;\n",
        "38. Regrets that, despite repeated and specific requests from the European Parliament, the Commission has yet to bring forward a legislative amendment to Directive 2000/54/EC to address the serious risks to health care workers arising from working with needles and medical sharps; calls on the Commission to expedite the completion of the impact assessment via the Tender (2007/S 139-171103) and expects a suitable amendment to the directive to be adopted well before the end of the legislature in mid-2009, in line with the European Parliament resolution T6-305/2006; calls on to the Commission to implement appropriate prevention and screening measures to reduce the risk of contracting blood borne diseases such as hepatitis C;\n",
        "39. Calls on the Commission to take the lead in developing and agreeing an EU code of practice on the prevention of healthcare associated infections;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Commission to improve health and safety in healthcare settings, including care homes, by initiating measures to encourage routine screening of healthcare staff to enable early detection and treatment to reduce occupationally acquired or occupationally communicable infections, such as MRSA;\n",
        "41. Welcomes the requirement for Member States to draw up national strategies; stresses that these strategies should cover the same period of time and begin on the same year so as to facilitate the comparison of both the national strategies and their results and that they should also set clear and measurable targets and have a special focus on SMEs and on vulnerable groups such as migrant workers, young and ageing workers, women, temporary agency workers and workers with disabilities;\n",
        "42. Underlines the fact that it is essential that the workplace be made accessible and safe for workers with disabilities through the provision of reasonable accommodation, the provision of special equipment adapted to individual needs and through the provision of those health services needed by people with disabilities, specifically because of their disability, including services designed to minimise and prevent further disabilities;\n",
        "43. Asks both the Commission and the Member States to apply and enforce the framework directive and the existing health and safety provisions fully and irrespective of their legal status to all workers and amend current legislation for certain at-risk professions if it has proven ineffective including those often ignored such as farm labour, healthcare workers, professional drivers, domestic workers, home workers, and the military where appropriate; as well as ensuring the full application and enforcement of the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Directive 2000/78/EC); also asks them to consider all available options to extend EU health and safety provisions to the self-employed and to sheltered employment services offered to people with disabilities;\n",
        "44. Calls on the Member States to give serious consideration to the different risks relating to occupational safety and health for female and male employees and to make provision for different social and physical infrastructure to counter those risks;\n",
        "45. Stresses that the need to analyse the risks that women and men face and take appropriate measures does not mean the reintroduction of protective policies of exclusion, nor does it mean developing different jobs for women and men;\n",
        "46. Considers that an employer's safety obligation should not just be to those he is legally bound to by an employment contract but also in subcontracting relations and that to this effect Member States should consider limiting the number of chains in the subcontract sequence and to impose joint liability on the principal contractor for the subcontractors' obligations towards their workers;\n",
        "47. Awaits the outcome of the second phase of consultation of the social partners on musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and asks the Commission to consider coming forward with proposals for a Directive, given the increasing occurrence of MSDs and that the current legislation would appear to be inadequate as it does not address all work situations or cover all risks concerning work-related MSDs; notes that scientific principles have to be fully taken into account;\n",
        "48. Awaits the outcome of the second phase of consultation of the social partners on the revision of the 2004 carcinogens directive and considers that the preferred option should be to amend that directive to include substances toxic for reproduction and to propose a revision of the binding occupational exposure limit values (BOELVs) for carcinogens and mutagens listed in the directive and to establish new BOELVs for some carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxins not yet included in the directive with crystalline silica being a priority;\n",
        "49. Recalls that threats to health and safety at work are not limited to manual labour; calls for more attention to the causes underlying the development of mental illnesses and to mental health, addiction and psychological hazards at the workplace, such as stress, harassment and mobbing, as well as violence and further calls for greater emphasis to be placed on employer policies for the promotion of good physical and mental health;\n",
        "50. Considers it essential for there to be greater coordination with the new European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki and for a number of issues arising in connection with the relationship between Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)[12]and the other directives concerning health at work to be clarified;\n",
        "51. Calls on the Commission and Member States to take due account of the simultaneous implementation of the Community strategy and the REACH Regulation: the strategy should seek to complement the REACH Regulation on protection against chemical hazards and should take advantage of the opportunity to enhance preventive action against chemical hazards at the workplace in connection with the implementation of REACH;\n",
        "52. Welcomes theconclusion of the framework agreements between the social partners on stress at work and on harassment and violence in the workplace; regrets, however, that thelatter agreement does not explicitly cover the issue of third party violence; therefore calls on the social partners to conclude a multi-sector agreement on this issue and the Commission to come forward with proposals, should such an agreement not be attainable; notes that studies show that temporary and short-term workers are specially vulnerable to becoming victims of harassment and violence at the workplace; calls, therefore, for agreements to take particular account of these groups;\n",
        "53. Highlights the difficult working conditions for many lorry drivers driving through Europe due to insufficient access to adequate rest facilities: Article 12 of Regulation 561/2006, on driving and rest time explicitly recognises the importance of a sufficient number of safe and secured rest facilities for professional drivers along the EU motorway network; therefore urges the Commission to follow up the pilot project for secured parking areas initiated by the European Parliament taking account of the recommended measures in the opinion from the European Economic and Social Committee TEN/290-CESE on safe and secure parking places;\n",
        "54. Calls on the Commission to undertake research into the feasibility and benefits both to health and safety at work and to society as a whole of requiring all new buildings intended to be workplaces to install fire sprinklers where it is safe to do so;\n",
        "55. Stresses the importance of a continuous dialogue between all interested parties including the public authorities, employers, employees, their representatives and civil society as a key tool in the effective development of high health and safety standards; this dialogue should lead to a better knowledge of the real risks for the health and safety of workers as well of the specific needs and requirements of certain groups of workers at business and sector levels and to an exchange of good practices;\n",
        "56. Urges Member States to ensure proper representation of women in decision-making in relation to OHS at all levels;\n",
        "57. Considers the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as one of the effective tools to improve the competitiveness, better occupational and safety at work, better working environment and in this aspect encourages exchange of good practices at local, national and European levels among the Member States and globally at multinational level as well as further applying of CSR on voluntary bases, but as an integrated part of business strategies for development;\n",
        "58. Considers that employee representation is of major importance to any workplace health and safety policy; considers the positive correlation between the existence of health and safety representatives in the workplace and improved performance cannot be underestimated and calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the participative approach and ensure as many workers as possible have access to health and safety representatives;\n",
        "59. Stresses that permanent employment is an important contributory factor to health and safety at work;\n",
        "60. Considers that excessive working hours/insufficient rest periods are a key factor in increased levels of accidents and illnesses at work and calls for a proper balance of work and family life;\n",
        "61. Congratulates the Bilbao Agency and the Dublin Foundation for the work carried out to date and takes the view that the expertise and powers of these bodies must be fully exploited; they should continue to be used as instruments for awareness-raising, collection, analysis and exchange of information, exchange of good practices and investigation to anticipate new and emerging risks, whether they are caused by social change or linked to technical innovation;\n",
        "62. Considers that it is vital to identify and monitor new and emerging risks – e.g. nanotechnologies and psychosocial risks, in good time; therefore encourages the Bilbao Agency's risk observatory to expand its work on risk assessment and prevention (concerning information flow) and expects the Commission to act on its findings and come forward with the necessary proposals when new risks are identified;\n",
        "63. Recommends to the Member States that they implement the necessary measures so that work in harsh or dangerous conditions is reflected in the social protection rights of the persons concerned, both while they are working and after retirement;\n",
        "64. Recommends that the Bilbao Agency conduct specific research into the particular problems and risks facing temporary and agency workers as well as those in subcontracted undertakings in order to facilitate the Commission and the Member States in combating the risks faced and properly implement the existing legislation concerning these groups, while recognising the type of work engaged in by these groups, such as construction, in certain Member States is by its nature more prone to accidents;\n",
        "65. Takes the view that in a global environment, it is necessary to cooperate with international organisations (WTO, WHO, ILO) and to ensure that international conventions and agreements on OHS are adopted and implemented by all parties; considers that this is an important factor in order to maintain the EU's competitiveness and to avoid EU undertakings being transferred outside the EU in search for a more permissive H&S legal environment; considers, furthermore, that this is a question of protecting human rights and should therefore be addressed when negotiating with third countries;\n",
        "66. Therefore calls on Member States to respect international provisions on H&S and in particular to ratify ILO Convention C-187 and to implement recommendation R-197;\n",
        "67. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
