    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Recalls that the Commission has for a long time been committed to giving local authorities a role as full partners in development aid, its latest commitments being: for ACP countries, the Cotonou Agreement; for all developing countries, the moral underpinning of the 2005 European Consensus on Development;\n",
        "2.  Recognises that the involvement of local authorities in development policies is essential for achieving the MDGs and ensuring good governance; believes that ownership of development policies is a significant step towards transparency and democracy in development aid and enables more effective and more viable projects and programmes to be devised on the basis of the beneficiaries' real needs;\n",
        "3.  Stresses the importance of North-South and South-South partnerships between local authorities and their representative associations in contributing to the strengthening of good governance and the achievement of the MDGs;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Commission to support and strengthen direct cooperation by European local authorities with their international partners; calls, in particular, for steps to be taken to ensure the continuity, including in financial terms, of the solidarity networks set up by the URB-AL, Asia URBS and other programmes, due to end in 2007 at the latest, which all represent commitments made to the populations;\n",
        "5.  Stresses that the principles of ownership, participation and good governance call for a multi-stakeholder approach in which the various development partners, whether third countries, local authorities or non-State actors, act in a complementary and coherent manner;\n",
        "6.  Stresses that local governments should enlist the support of the other local stakeholders (universities, social agents, development NGOs, companies, etc.) and stimulate citizens' participation in public life;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the local stakeholders to work together with international organisations to monitor industry and agriculture with the aim of preventing child labour and cooperating in the construction and maintenance of adequate school facilities with trained teaching staff and free transport and meals, so that all children are able to attend school;\n",
        "8.  Considers it important, however, to make a clear distinction between the specific role of local authorities and that of 'non-State actors', in terms of their sphere of competence, legitimacy and democratic control, experience in management of local affairs and involvement in the implementation of public policies;\n",
        "9.  Welcomes the political recognition and the specific funds granted to local authorities by the above-mentioned instrument for development cooperation (DCI): (a) local authorities are involved upstream in the definition of the cooperation strategies of developing countries, the elaboration of geographic and thematic programmes, their implementation and their evaluation; (b) up to 15% of the thematic programme 'non-State actors and local authorities' may be allocated directly to local authorities; (c) European local authorities will be integrated in a structured political dialogue with the European institutions and the other Northern development stakeholders;\n",
        "10.  Calls on the Commission to refer, in future development cooperation financing instruments and legislative texts, to the role of local authorities and their representative associations as 'political partners' and to ensure that they are involved in all phases of the cooperation process  and have direct access to European funding;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission to specify in the country strategy papers the procedures and mechanisms for more closely involving local authorities, their representative organisations and civil society partners in all phases of the cooperation process (dialogues and formulation of strategy papers, programming, implementation, reviews, evaluations) and for EC delegations to be informed thereof in order to ensure their implementation;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission and the Council to recognise associations of Southern local authorities as effective interfaces between local authorities on the one hand and the governments of the Member States and the EU on the other, in defining strategies and implementing development policies;\n",
        "13. Regrets that, to date, local authorities in developing countries have only been involved in the implementation of projects and not in the elaboration of development policies, including in ACP countries, despite the revision of the Cotonou Agreement, which places political dialogue with local authorities at the heart of the partnership; undertakes, therefore, to carry out a detailed political follow-up with associations of elected representatives of the implementation of the DCI within both the EU and developing countries, in particular by examining country strategy papers, and to inform local authorities of new opportunities open to them and, in the event of difficulties on the ground raised by local authorities, to forward information to the Commission;\n",
        "14. Stresses, in this connection, that the Commission's above-mentioned Introductory Note of 23 December 1999 put forward an Operational Guide for delegations in all developing countries, which clearly explained how to involve local authorities and non-State actors in each phase of the cooperation process, advocated that decentralised stakeholders be 'involved upstream in policy formulation and programming', and which remains a useful guide for the implementation of new development instruments;\n",
        "15.  Welcomes the fact that, in its above-mentioned Communication of 25 January 2006, the Commission reaffirms that local authorities are full stakeholders in development and proposes 'involving non-State actors and local authorities in the development process, including through dialogue and financial support'; stresses that, in accordance with the new DCI provisions, this will mean providing for their involvement in the devising of national strategies and geographic programmes, given that this is where European cooperation policy guidelines are defined; regrets therefore that, in the same Communication, the Commission restricts the possibility of local authority involvement and considers it as secondary, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in relation to geographic programmes; considers, therefore, that cooperation between local authorities and the central government will make development aid more effective  and enable more effective use to be made of the funding earmarked as well as allow aid to reach those most in need;\n",
        "16. Stresses the need to establish ongoing dialogue and consultation between the EU and local authorities and their representative associations at all levels - national, regional and global - in particular by involving them as observers in forums for dialogue between the EU and partner countries, such as the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the ACP-EU Council of Ministers, on the same terms as the representatives of non-State actors;\n",
        "17. Calls for local authorities and their representative associations to be allowed to benefit from direct and appropriate funding: (a) under DCI geographic programmes, in view of their role in local governance and the importance of their participation in the achievement of the MDGs; (b) in the 'non-State actors and local authorities' thematic programme, given that the enhancement of their capacity for dialogue and participation in the cooperation process (organisation and representation, establishment of consultation, dialogue and lobby mechanisms) in Europe and developing countries calls for financial support that is more in keeping with their new responsibilities;\n",
        "18.    Calls, therefore, on the Commission for the revision of the coming development instruments in 2008/2009:\n",
        "19. Stresses the importance of a structured dialogue between European local authorities and Community institutions, as defined by the DCI, so that European local authorities are provided with a framework in which they can effectively cooperate and dialogue with development institutions and other stakeholders;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to establish a partnership with a platform of associations representing local authorities active in the field of cooperation, modelled on Concord (European NGO Confederation for Relief and Development) for NGOs, to facilitate dialogue and cooperation with European institutions, coordinate cooperation between local authorities and assist local authorities in implementing development policies, and in particular strengthen the capacities of its members;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to set up an international monitoring centre for local democracy and decentralisation, in partnership with local authority organisations, to:\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission to promote structural measures aimed at providing an impetus and support for decentralisation and local capacity building in partner countries, together with greater democracy and citizens' participation;\n",
        "23.  Proposes using the mechanisms for revision of cooperation strategies, including that of the Cotonou Agreement, to monitor progress made in the involvement of local authorities in the cooperation process and to seek to remove legal, political and organisational constraints standing in the way of the involvement of local authorities in the cooperation process; 0 0   0\n",
        "24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the parliaments and governments of the Member States.\n"
