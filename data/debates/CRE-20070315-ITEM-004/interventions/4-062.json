Due to the wide range of objectives set within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and given the delays in the implementation of these goals, this report is of high importance in order to foster the involvement of local authorities as essential partners in all phases of the cooperation process, with a view to achieving these goals. In line with the subsidiarity principle, local actors are the best partners in order to ensure that the development aid is appropriately geared to the real need of the local communities. Their role has been up to now far too limited despite the long political recognition of the added value they can bring to development policies. In this respect, I also warmly welcome the proposal to set up an international monitoring centre for local democracy and decentralisation to monitor the progress of the involvement of local authorities in both the implementation of projects and in the elaboration of development policies.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – First of all, I would like to warmly welcome the content of the own-initiative report of our colleague Pierre Schapira on the importance of the role of local authorities in achieving the goals of development cooperation.
