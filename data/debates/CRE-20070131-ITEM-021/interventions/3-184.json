{"speaker": "Linda McAvan,", "english": "Linda McAvan, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ries, who has produced a good report and worked in a very collaborative fashion. I should also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs. We have all worked together and I think, Commissioner, you will see that we have a general consensus that something must be done. We are grateful to the Commission for putting this issue at the top of its working agenda.\nThe EU cannot do everything. Mr Bushill-Matthews said that. Responsibility is at national level, but there are three areas where the EU could make a difference. The first has already been mentioned: food labelling. What we in the PSE Group want is mandatory back-of-pack labelling of the eight key nutrients. We do not want labelling where the industry itself decides which nutrients it is going to make consumers aware of. Many retail companies and food companies are doing this already and they want a level playing field as well. Many of them want mandatory labelling on the back of the pack, and I think it is something you should be looking at in the revision of your regulations, Commissioner.\nWe want front-of-pack signposting and clear systems, and we want this to happen soon. As regards advertising, we must not play lip-service to tackling advertising to children. We have to do something real about it. In the UK something real is happening. Our regulator is now stopping advertising of foods that are high in fat, sugar or salt to children, and I think we should look for this across Europe.\nFinally, a key area you could work in, Commissioner, is that of product reformulation. This week is National Salt Awareness Week in the UK. Many food manufacturers have reduced salt successfully in foods in the UK. We want to see more action on that level and we want to see more action on trans fats. Mrs Ries mentioned this. Trans fats are dangerous. They have no nutritional value. They are banned in New York. Denmark has tried to take action. We want you to stop the action against Denmark and to take action at EU level to do something about trans fats. What is the point of adding things to food which have no value?\nI welcome the written declaration that I, Mr Higgins, Mr Jørgensen and Mr Bowis have launched this week calling for the EU to act on trans fats. I hope you will look at that, Commissioner.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Linda McAvan, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ries, who has produced a good report and worked in a very collaborative fashion.
