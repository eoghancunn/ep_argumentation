        "28. Agrees with the view that lifelong learning plays an important role first and foremostfor enhancing social inclusion and employability, but also in the individual’s personal development and in overcoming the mismatches in the labour market and achieving the Lisbon goal of a higher participation rate for those over 50 years of age, as well as for competitiveness;\n",

        "31. Highlights the fact that a low level of qualification, which is the current situation of a third of the European workforce (72 million workers), implies a high risk of unemployment, and by training the individual will continue to possess or acquire the competences necessary to gain employment and improve the quality of his or her work. Stresses the importance of recognising and validating skills acquired through non-formal and informal learning,which provides a basis for the development of lifelong learningboth in the national vocational qualifications frameworks and inthe European Qualifications Framework;\n",
        "32. Stresses the importance of all citizens having equal access and opportunities to take part in lifelong learning programmes, and regrets in this context the fact that those with the lowest levels of initial education, women, immigrants, older people, people in rural areas, and the disabled are the least likely to participate in society. They must be offered different, suitable programmes and methods. In this context, takes the view that special emphasis should be placed on education and training in new technologies for workers and the unemployed, and calls on the Member States to support the use of new information and communications technologies for educational purposes, as they play a key role in ensuring equal opportunities for everybody, facilitating participation in lifelong learning, and for those with the lowest levels of education receiving particular promotion and funding;\n",

        "34.  Stresses the importance of actively involving the social partners and other stakeholders, including social NGOs,as it is only through functional social partnerships that employers and employees are able to acton the same level.In Member States without a developed structure of social partnership its creation should be given support;\n",
        "35.  Underlines the importance of ESF and other structural funds in order to achieve the goal of lifelong learning for all and urges the monitoring of the Structural Funds to ensure that more is allocated to those who need lifelong learning the most.Regrets that in some Member States insufficient priority and funding are being dedicated to increasing access to adult learning opportunities, especially for older and lower-skilled workers; calls on the Member States to use the Structural Funds more actively , and in particular the European Social Fund; calls on the Commission to reinforce the specific programmes in this area;\n",
        "36. Stresses that improving the delivery of adult learning, the provision of information and making it easier to combine work with family life are essential to raise participation and are stimulating if they are combined with incentives. Measures to promote effective delivery include the availability of learning sites, facilitating learning at the workplace by adjusting working hours, childcare facilities locally, distance learning services for the disabled or vulnerable in remote areas, information and guidance on lifelong learning measures and on job opportunities, tailored programmes and availability of flexible teaching arrangements, must also be generally recognized and should contribute to professional advancement;\n",
        "37. Urges the Member States to take appropriate measures to tackle the low employment rates of older workers, in particular those who have had atypical career paths or lack ICT skills, and to put in place the necessary conditions to provide lifelong learning services at every level to facilitate progress in employment, whether it be first time entry, a return to employment or the wish to prolong working lives; considers it no less important to encourage companies, and create incentives to this effect, to employ or appoint older employees for longer, since as a rule they are highly competent, experienced, reliable and highly trained;\n",
        "38. Calls on the Member States to ensure that workers who are obliged to change their job after an accident at work or illness can participate in continuing training and improve their career prospects;\n",

        "43. Considers that adult education should achieve high skill levels in all sectors by means of high-quality educational and cultural activities and training models, so as to ensure that individuals' knowledge and skills match the changes in what is required of workers and the changes in the organisation of work and in working methods;\n",
        "44. Urges coordination, cooperation, efficiency and transparency between legislative measures and the institutional frameworks, networks and partnerships of bodies or associations involved in adult learning, using local, regional, national, European ( public or private ) financial resources;\n",
        "45. Considers it essential that financial incentives be offered to allow people free access to training and education and the ensuing benefits; points out that such financial incentives could take the form of tax incentives, allowances, grants, co-financing, or reductions in taxation or social security costs for employers establishing appropriate working condition for adult learning;\n",
        "46. Appreciates the importance of in-house training and stresses that high priority must be given to small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-businesses and new enterprises, as they are the least able to afford to train their staff;\n",
