{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). –", "english": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). – Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for all the work she has done in preparing this own-initiative report. The corresponding Commission report is clear in reiterating that finning is prohibited within the Community, and in its conclusion that the percentage equivalence ratio of shark fin to body weight does not need to be altered. The rapporteur disagrees with this percentage ratio figure, and she is of the opinion that it should be increased from the level of 5% to 6.5%. This is the main issue of disagreement with the Commission report, and with some of us.\nMrs Miguélez Ramos argues that some scientific evidence favours her 6.5% ratio position, but let me say respectfully that other scientific evidence supplied by at least equally reputable sources supports the view that the 5% figure is in fact more than adequate. The latter scientific evidence further supports the view that if the ratio is indeed increased, this will result in the enhancement of the very practice we want to stop, i.e. finning. Such a practice, coupled with the general failure of implementation of the relevant Community regulation, will, in my view, lead with mathematical accuracy and in the not-too-distant future, to the endangerment of the very existence of certain shark species. In this respect, please note that an increase from 5% to 6.5% may seem small at first glance, but in reality it is not. It in fact represents an increase of 30%. In other words, potentially 30% of the shark catches could end up in finning.\nMuch as we wish to help increase the profits of our fishermen, it is our primary concern and duty to prevent the extinction of any shark species. I therefore urge you to support Mr Davies’ amendment tabled on behalf of the ALDE Group and aimed at maintaining the ratio at 5%, as proposed by the Commission and as supported by the Commissioner in his speech here tonight.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). – Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for all the work she has done in preparing this own-initiative report.
