{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . Madam President, I should like to thank honourable Members for their contributions. The only problem that has been raised substantively relates to the whole issue concerning 5% versus 6.5%. In this regard, I should say that the ratio between fin weight and body weight varies significantly depending on the shark species concerned. Scientific information was already available at the time the regulation was adopted, especially as regards the blue shark. The Council, however, did not consider that a species-dependent approach was appropriate, and the maximum 5% fin- versus live body-weight ratio set in the regulation was certainly not presented as being based on scientific considerations alone.\nThe 5% fin- to body-weight requirement represents the only current restriction on a number of shark species caught in fisheries, notably the blue shark. This should not be reviewed, at least until other management measures are in place to reduce their fishing mortality. I have no problem with further research, but this has to be done before any amendments are proposed. Again, I have no problem with regular reviews. I have made reference to an overall consideration of a Community plan of action for sharks, when we will have ample time to discuss this and other issues concerning conservation of sharks.\nOn the point raised by Mr Davies concerning the plan of action, the EU has not yet formalised a plan of action for sharks. Nevertheless, many of the actions that would constitute such a plan of action are already incorporated into Community legislation or other initiatives under the CFP. The EU has taken considerable management action with regard to sharks, for example the improvement of data collection for large pelagic shark species, the establishment of catch limits for certain shark species, skates and rays in the North Sea, deepwater sharks in the north-east Atlantic, prohibiting trawl fisheries within littoral areas in the Mediterranean, banning the use of driftnets that may catch large pelagic sharks, prohibiting shark finning and establishing specific conditions under which only the removal of fins of sharks may be authorised – which is what we are discussing today – and the control and limitation of fishing capacity.\nIt is important to note that many of these measures apply to EC vessels, irrespective of whether or not they operate in EC waters. Such measures should also be promoted in the international context, especially in other FMOs where we support measures to ensure appropriate management in respect of high-sea fisheries.\nThe Commission’s departments are currently reflecting on whether a formal plan of action for sharks should be developed in the very near future and I am favourably inclined to doing so. However, considering the importance of the work to be done, the necessary collection of information, reflection and consultation and assessment of possible measures, it would not be realistic to set the finalisation date of any comprehensive Commission proposal for a plan of action for sharks within the time limit indicated in Amendment 8.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission .
