{"speaker": "Chris Davies,", "english": "Chris Davies, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, we can argue whether a 5% ratio of fin weight to body weight is appropriate or whether a larger proportion is needed. I have no doubt that an increase would be wrong, but no doubt the Spanish and Portuguese fishing interests would argue the other way. I hope Parliament will be able to support my proposal for a study based on best scientific evidence before any decision is made. I hope it will do that not simply because it represents a compromise in those positions but because it is the most appropriate way forward.\nSo far as I am concerned, the whole shark fin regulation has always been too weak. It was far too weak when we introduced it. Enforcement is problematic to say the least and, as in so many aspects of fishing, varies from one Member State to another. It certainly needs to be reviewed at regular intervals. The idea that we should just have one review and that is the end of it, as originally intended, is simply nonsense. I hope the Commissioner will support the idea of more regular reviews, just as I support him in opposing the idea that quotas should be set for long periods of time.\nThe real issue here is so much bigger. We face the prospect of the extinction of many shark species – slow-breathing creatures that have lived on this planet for many millennia longer than our own species. The risk is that with this particular regulation we are simply playing at the edges.\nWe are killing too many sharks. We have to stop that. We need the Commission to come forward with a shark management action plan. We have heard from the Commissioner why it will take time to do that, but I seem to remember joining with other Members of Parliament in calling for this some three years ago. I hope that the Commissioner will be able to finish this debate by telling us exactly how much work has already been done over the past three years in preparing the groundwork for publication of the shark management action plan. My impression is that absolutely nothing has been done. I hope the Commissioner can correct that impression.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Chris Davies, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, we can argue whether a 5% ratio of fin weight to body weight is appropriate or whether a larger proportion is needed.
