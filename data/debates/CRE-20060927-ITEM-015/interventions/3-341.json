{"speaker": "Catherine Stihler,", "english": "Catherine Stihler, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I am delighted that the UK Government was one of the key supporters of Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 concerning the disgusting practice of removing shark fins on board vessels. The regulation is designed to prevent shark finning, where shark carcasses are thrown overboard after high-value shark fins have been removed. You could call this ‘slit and chuck’. Without their fins, the sharks suffocate to death.\nThe practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species. Only today American researchers using fish auction records from Hong Kong have calculated that the trade in shark fins kills 26 million to 73 million sharks a year. Against this background, I am appalled and disappointed that this report threatens an increase in shark finning.\nParagraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5% fin- to live-weight ratio to 6.5%, particularly for blue sharks. Paragraph 3 of the report incorrectly implies that ICES and ICCAT support an increase in fin- to live-weight ratio for the blue shark. A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005, but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion. The same goes for ICCAT, where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the ratio.\nAmendment 1 is placed first on the voting list, and I recommend support for it. I fear that the European Parliament may not give its support to any of these amendments, a retrograde step, and I ask colleagues to say no to ‘slit and chuck’.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Catherine Stihler, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I am delighted that the UK Government was one of the key supporters of Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 concerning the disgusting practice of removing shark fins on board vessels.
