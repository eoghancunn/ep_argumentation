{"speaker": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I also welcome the Commissioner's statement at the beginning that he wants at least to remain at the 5% level of finning for the present. I believe – along with Mr Stevenson, and we have tabled an amendment to this effect – that instead of leaving it at 5% we need to reduce it to 2%. To take it up to 6.5% would only encourage the catching and finning of more and more sharks. Over 70 million sharks are taken each year and we really need to reduce the number. To increase it to 6.5% would be crazy.\nWe in Europe very much want a sustainable fisheries policy. We also want high welfare standards. If you increase the percentage of shark fins that can be landed, the chances of increasing the number of sharks caught and of finning are greater. We need to set an example to the world. In most parts of the world the percentage of fins that can be landed by fishing is lower. I therefore urge the Commissioner to go further and reduce the percentage of fins that can be landed.\nHowever much more valuable shark fins are than the rest of the body, it is absolutely right that the whole of the body should be landed and used. It is crazy to carry on as we do when nearly 50% of the 130 species of shark are now endangered.
