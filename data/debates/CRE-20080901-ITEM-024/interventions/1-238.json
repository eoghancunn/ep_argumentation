Likewise I think that we can also avoid reference to tax competition where we are divided but which is not core to this report. Therefore I think we can achieve some harmony amongst ourselves.\nOn all these fronts, colleagues and Commissioner, I do not think that inaction or tentative action is an adequate response. 2.5% of GDP is at stake. That is a huge chunk of the tax base. As our colleague, Mr Sánchez Presedo, points out, that is possibly 5% of tax.\nIf any politician here or in any Member State campaigned on the basis of putting up tax by 5% to pay for nothing, they would not get very far. So, and I say this to Member States in particular, getting prickly about exchange of information, doing the minimum, being fearful, is just the same as taxing 5% for nothing, for that is what it costs the honest taxpayer.
