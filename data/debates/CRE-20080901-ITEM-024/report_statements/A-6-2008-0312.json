    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Notes that the purpose of the EU fiscal fraud strategy must be to tackle tax losses due to fiscal fraud by identifying the areas in which improvements to both EC legislation and administrative cooperation between Member States can be made, which effectively promote the reduction of tax fraud, to the greatest extent possible without creating unnecessary burdens both for tax administrations and tax payers;\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Member States finally to take the fight against fiscal fraud seriously;\n",
        "3.  Recalls that the establishment of a VAT system based on the ‘origin principle’, which implies that transactions between Member States liable to VAT would bear the tax charged in the country of origin instead of being zero-rated, remains a long-term solution for combating tax fraud effectively; notes that the ‘origin principle’ would make it unnecessary to exempt goods traded in the internal market from VAT and to tax them subsequently in the country of destination; recalls that in order to be operational, a VAT system based on the ‘origin principle’ requires tax approximation between countries to avoid tax competition, as well as the establishment of a clearing system, as originally proposed by the Commission in 1987;\n",
        "4.  Regrets the blockading attitude of some Member States in the last ten years, which has thwarted any effective EU strategy to counter fiscal fraud;\n",
        "5.  Regrets that in spite of repeated analyses, demands, and objections, the Council has not yet adopted an effective strategy for the fight against fiscal fraud;\n",
        "6.  Urges the Commission not to desist from tackling the problem head-on, in spite of repeated failures in past decades;\n",
        "7.  Acknowledges that estimates of overall (direct and indirect) tax losses due to fiscal fraud range from EUR 200 to 250 billion, which is equal to 2 to 2,25 % of GDP in the European Union, EUR 40 billion of that being due to VAT fraud, estimated to comprise 10 % of VAT receipts, 8 % of the total excise duty receipts on alcoholic beverages in 1998 and 9 % of the total excise duty receipts on tobacco products; regrets, however,that no precise figures are available because national reporting standards vary so widely;\n",
        "8.  Calls for a uniform data survey in all the Member States as the basis for transparency and national measures against tax fraud;\n",
        "9.  Regrets, as a result of the lack of data collected at national level, that neither the real extent of the problem can be properly assessed, nor the monitoring of changes, whether positive or negative, properly evaluated;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to consider a harmonised European system for collecting data and producing statistics on fiscal fraud, so as to reach an assessment of the full extent of the phenomenon that is as accurate as possible;\n",
        "11. Recalls that the elimination of the informal economy can not be realised without the implementation of appropriate incentives; suggests, moreover, that Member States should report, via the Lisbon scoreboard, the extent to which they have succeeded in reducing their informal economies;\n",
        "12. Notes that VAT-related tax fraud is a matter of particular concern for the functioning of the internal market in so far as it has a direct cross-border impact, involves substantial amounts of lost revenue and directly affects the EU budget;\n",
        "13. Reiterates that the current VAT system, established in 1993, was intended only to be a transitional system and that Parliament has requested that the Commission put forward proposals aimed at making a final decision on the definitive VAT system by 2010;\n",
        "14. Asserts that the free circulation of persons, goods, services and capital within the internal market since 1993, as well as advances in new technology of small, high-value goods, have combined to make it increasingly difficult to combat VAT fraud, this being exacerbated by the complexity and fragmented nature of the current system which makes transactions difficult to track and thus more open to abuse;\n",
        "15. Notes the increasing occurrence of missing-trader fraud and the deliberate abuse of the VAT system by criminal gangs who set up such schemes to take advantage of the failures in the system; and highlights the VAT carousel fraud case launched by Eurojust, involving 18 Member States and tax fraud amounting to an estimated EUR 2,1 billion;\n",
        "16. Supports the Commission in its efforts to bring about a fundamental change to the current VAT system; welcomes the fact that Member States do now regard this as a matter of some priority and urges Member States to be prepared to take substantive measures in this context;\n",
        "17. Considers the current system to be outdated and in need of radical overhaul without over-burdening honestbusinesses with red tape; believes that maintaining the status quo is not an option; Reverse Charge mechanism\n",
        "18. Notes that in a reverse-charge system VAT is accounted for by the taxable customer instead of the supplier; recognises that that mechanism has the advantage of removing the opportunity to engage in missing-trader fraud, by designating the taxable person to whom the goods are supplied as the person liable to pay the VAT;\n",
        "19. Notes that the creation of a double-VAT system would run counter to the efficient operation of the internal market and would be the source of a more complex environment that could discourage business investment, which would be overcome in the long term only by a generalised, mandatory reverse-charge system, as opposed to an optional or selected supplies-only system;\n",
        "20. Notes, furthermore, that the reverse-charge system does not allow for fractionated payment and total VAT is paid only at the end of the supply chain, removing the self-policing control mechanism of VAT; warns that new forms of fraud may appear including increased tax losses at the retail level and the misuse of VAT identification numbers, and that combating such fraud through the introduction of additional verification could result in additional administrative burdens for honest traders; consequently urges caution and serious consideration before the introduction of a reverse-charge system; notes, nevertheless, that the application of a threshold in order to limit the risk of untaxed final consumption helps combat fraud and considers the EUR 5 000 threshold suggested by the Council to be reasonable; Pilot Project\n",
        "21. Notes,  while remaining wary and critical, that a pilot project may help Member States better to understand the inherent risks of the reverse-charge mechanism, and urges the Commission and the Member States to lay down appropriate guarantees to ensure that neither the Member State participating nor any other Member State is exposed to major risks during the operation of the pilot project;\n",
        "22. Believes that the best solution to tackle VAT fraud related to cross-border supplies is to introduce a system in which the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies is replaced by taxation at the rate of 15 %: notes that the operation of that system would be better served if the variety and complexity of reduced rates were substantially simplified, minimising the administrative burden on both businesses and tax authorities; notes that individual reductions of VAT rates put in place before 1992 should be carefully examined and assessed with respect to whether their persistence is justified on economic grounds;\n",
        "23. Recognises that because of differential VAT rates, the taxation of intra-Community supplies would require rebalancing payments between Member States; considers that such rebalancing should be made through a clearing house that would facilitate the passing of revenue between Member States; stresses that the operation of a clearing house is technically feasible;\n",
        "24. Believes that a decentralised clearing house system may be more appropriate and could be developed more rapidly, in so far as it opens up possibilities for Member States bilaterally to agree details of importance, taking into account their individual balance of trade, similarities of operating the VAT system and their control mechanisms, and mutual trust;\n",
        "25. Emphasises that it should be the responsibility of the tax administration of the Member State of supply to collect the VAT from its supplier and to make a transfer via the clearing system to the tax administration where the intra-Community acquisition has taken place; recognises that it is necessary to build mutual trust between tax administrations;\n",
        "26. Stresses that Member States cannot combat cross-border tax fraud in isolation; believes that exchanges of information and cooperation between Member States and with the Commission have been insufficient to combat tax fraud effectively in either substance or speed; considers that direct contact between local or national anti-fraud offices is neither developed nor sufficiently implemented, leading to inefficiency, under-use of the arrangements for administrative cooperation and delays in communication;\n",
        "27. Insists that in order to protect fiscal revenue of all the Member States in relation to the internal market, Member States should take comparable measures against fraudsters, in particular in terms of sanctions and criminal proceedings, regardless of where losses of revenue take place; calls on the Commission to propose possible mechanisms to promote such cooperation between Member States;\n",
        "28. Welcomes the Commission's proposals for the amendment of the VAT Directive and the VAT Administrative Cooperation Regulation to speed up the collection and exchange of information on intra-Community transactions from 2010 onwards; recognises that the proposed reporting rules of one month will add an administrative burden to businesses that provide only services which are presently not subject to that rule, but accepts that this is necessary in view of the possibility of carousel fraud in some services;\n",
        "29. Urges the Council to adopt proposed measures quickly and invites the Commission to submit further proposals on the automated access by all other Member States to certain non-sensitive data held by Member States on their own taxable persons (business sector, certain data concerning turnover, etc.), and on the harmonisation of the procedures for the registration and de-registration of persons liable for VAT to ensure the swift detection and de-registration of fake taxable persons; stresses that Member States must take responsibility for keeping their data up to date, in particular, as regards de-registering and the detection of fraudulent registrations;\n",
        "30. Recalls that tax havens represent a barrier to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, as they put downward pressure on tax rates and, in general, on tax revenues, thereby exacerbating the effects of tax competition, which erodes the fiscal sovereignty of Member States;\n",
        "31. Stresses also that in times of budgetary discipline any erosion of the fiscal base provoked by tax havens or unrestrained tax competition will jeopardise Member States’ ability to comply with the reformed Stability and Growth Pact; and that a decrease in public revenue jeopardises the European Social Model;\n",
        "32. Stresses that removing tax havens requires, inter alia, a three-pronged strategy: tackling tax avoidance, widening the scope of the Savings Tax Directive and requesting that the OECD, through its members, sanction non-cooperative tax havens;\n",
        "33. Regrets that the Member States are hindering reform of the Savings Tax Directive by their continual new objections and delaying tactics and urges the Commission to put forward its proposals as soon as possible in spite of the signs of resistance;\n",
        "34. Points out that reform of the Savings Tax Directive must tackle its various loopholes and deficiencies, as they facilitate tax evasion and fiscal fraud operations;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission, in the context of reform of the Savings Tax Directive, to examine options for reform, including the widening of the directive's scope to cover all legal entities and all sources of financial revenue;\n",
        "36. Urges the European Union to make the elimination of tax havens at a worldwide level a priority, considering their detrimental effects on the tax revenue of individual Member States; invites the Council and the Commission to use the leverage of EU trade power when negotiating trade and cooperation agreements with the governments of tax havens, in order to persuade them to eliminate tax provisions and practices that favour tax evasion and fraud; welcomes, as a first step, the recommendations of the Council of 14 May 2008 to include in trade agreements a clause on good governance in tax matters; and asks the Commission to put forward immediately such a clause in the negotiations of trade agreements in the future; 0 0     0\n",
        "37. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
