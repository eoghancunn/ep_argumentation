    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Considers that the integration capacity of the European Union means in particular that it must be in a position, in the light of budgetary realities, to pursue the objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion; considers therefore that it is necessary at the time of the accession of every candidate country to decide whether the EU is capable of integrating the state in question;\n",
        "2.   Considers that institutional, financial and political reform is also necessary in the context of a review of the EU financial framework; in this connection, believes that a comparison should be made between the effects of the various main funding instruments (European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) on the development of EU-27, thus enabling appropriate budgetary decisions to be taken;\n",
        "3.   Considers that future enlargements must not lead to ever more regions ceasing to be eligible for cohesion policy funding under the current Objective 1 as a result of the statistical effect and without existing disparities really being eliminated;\n",
        "4.   Stresses that an honest and efficient cohesion policy is impossible without an increase in EU spending to 1,18 % of EU GNI, as was stated by Parliament in its resolution of 8 June 2005 on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013[9];\n",
        "5.   Regrets, therefore, that, in its Communication of 8 November 2006, the Commission does not offer any in-depth analysis of the financial consequences of future enlargements;\n",
        "6.   Calls on the Commission to present a detailed impact analysis in order to enable due assessment of the full effects on structural policy of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria;\n",
        "7.   Calls also on the Commission, in connection with forthcoming enlargements, regularly to calculate, showing separate figures for each state, the regional policy expenditure which the EU would be likely to incur, using the current as well as the amended and extended criteria, and what consequences this would have on the existing eligibility for funding of the regions; in this respect, notes that the databases and analytical instruments of ESPON could also be used; believes that consideration should also be given to improving the integration of the various EU funding instruments;\n",
        "8.   Considers that there is a need for ongoing studies that are based on experience gained with previous enlargements and that include the socio-economic improvements that will take place during the current programming period, in order to develop scenarios for the future financing of EU cohesion policy;\n",
        "9.   Stresses the importance of a very strict approach in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the use of the Structural Funds entailing sound management and appropriate monitoring in order, in the interests of Union citizens, to optimise the cost-benefit ratio of the EU's cohesion expenditure;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to devote a chapter in its new, 4th cohesion report to its view of the sustainability of current cohesion policy and to the future measures that might, where appropriate, impact on cohesion policy;\n",
        "11. Considers that, in view of the current state of the EU's resources system, it would be difficult to finance any future enlargement without jeopardising the effectiveness of current cohesion policies;\n",
        "12. Urges the Commission to issue a communication setting out a proposal for a graduated model for cohesion policy, making it possible to draw a further distinction between pre-accession assistance and membership and enabling potential accession candidates to receive effective support for regional development, subject to their political progress, prior to possible membership of the European Union;\n",
        "13. Calls for a graduated approach to Turkey in particular, concentrating more closely on the funding of specific thematic areas (such as industry clusters, institution-building and equality) and regions, so as to avoid the unthinking adoption of the usual accession-related financial measures and achieve more targeted effects on cohesion and growth;\n",
        "14. Notes that a graduated approach to regional policy dependent on the political progress of the candidate state could be presented as a special form of EU membership or an enhanced 'EEA+' membership;\n",
        "15. Asks to be involved in the co-decision procedure for the evaluation and reform of pre-accession assistance from 2010 onwards;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission to define in more detail what it means by 'reinforcing the neighbourhood policy', and in this context to give more thought to structural funding instruments;\n",
        "17. Considers it essential for the effectiveness of cohesion policy that the individual responsibility of the Member States should be increased in future by means of higher national rates of co-financing, particularly in regions that have already received EU funding in many programming periods;\n",
        "18. Proposes, in the context of the debate on future cohesion policy, that the EU should make greater use of the leverage effect of loan financing - particularly in regions that have already received EU funding for many years - in order to improve the effectiveness of Community support, albeit without replacing it;\n",
        "19. Considers in this connection that more favourable conditions should be set for the financing of loans and grants for the least developed regions of the EU;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to devise proposals for a future cohesion policy tailored more closely to the actual needs of the regions, since regions which have been receiving aid from EU funds for 10, 20 or 30 years have clearly achieved a different level of development than those which have not yet received any funding; believes that greater differentiation may possibly be the answer to the future challenges facing EU cohesion policy;\n",
        "21. Expresses concern at the fact that in some regions EU aid is poorly targeted, as a result of which the situation in those regions is failing to improve despite many years of financial support, meaning that Community resources are being wasted; calls for the introduction of a maximum period of time during which regions may receive structural funding, with a view to avoiding situations in which regions that have received EU support for many years still remain at the same low level of development;\n",
        "22. Calls for more use to be made of private funds as a source of co-financing structural funding, and for the private co-financing of projects and programmes under the Structural Funds to be significantly simplified in line with best practice;\n",
        "23. Calls for future structural funding to be geared so as to avoid displacement effects as well as the EU funding of company relocations, and considers that the Commission must look critically, in the context of cohesion policy, at whether subsidies given to firms are effective in influencing business decisions regarding location, taking into account the size of the firms in question;\n",
        "24. Notes that the success of cohesion policy is linked to national economic policies and that in this connection the implementation of the National Action Plans for the Lisbon Strategy has a particular influence on the success of cohesion policy;\n",
        "25. Calls, therefore, on the Commission and Council to consider linking the award of funds under future cohesion policy to a favourable sustainable national growth policy, to be defined by measurable quantitative and qualitative indicators covering more than just per-capita GDP, so as to boost the effectiveness of cohesion policy;\n",
        "26. Urges the Commission to ensure that, in the framework of future programmes for regional competitiveness and for territorial cooperation, funding is concentrated more closely on the Europeanisation of the regional economy and on infrastructures of European importance;\n",
        "27. Calls for greater use to be made of the Structural Funds in future in order to cushion the effects of demographic change and resulting regional migration;\n",
        "28. Considers that greater use should be made in future of the European Social Fund as a horizontal instrument, among other things, to help regions cope with the social challenges of globalisation as well as the effects of demographic change;\n",
        "29. Stresses that the results of cohesion policy can only be reviewed if the award of Structural Funds takes place in a transparent manner, and therefore calls for the European Union to employ very stringent transparency criteria for the award of funding;\n",
        "30. Calls for tougher sanctions in the event of proven abuse of funding and more effective procedures for the recovery of funds;\n",
        "31. Notes that successful measures to combat corruption, and the building of administrative capacity to implement Structural Fund programmes efficiently and transparently, are crucial preconditions for the receipt of structural funding; calls for consistent and rigid application of the control instruments;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider all these points when conducting its mid-term review of the EU's current financial framework;\n",
        "33. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions.\n"
