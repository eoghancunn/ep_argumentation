    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Is firmly convinced that the aim must be to develop high-quality global accounting standards;\n",
        "2.   Notes that the IASCF is a private self-regulatory body which has been given the role of lawmaker for the EU by Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002; underlines that the IASCF/IASB lack transparency, legitimacy, accountability and are not under the control of any democratically elected parliament or government, without the EU institutions having established the accompanying procedures and practices of consultation and democratic decision-making that are usual in its own legislative procedures; welcomes, however, that the IASCF/IASB have sought to improve these deficiencies, for example through twice-yearly meetings at which the IASCF reviews the IASB's work, through impact assessments for new standards, through the introduction of formalised feedback statements for comments received in public consultations, etc.;\n",
        "3.  Considers that, lacking satisfactory solutions to the set up and oversight of the IASCF/IASB, a debate should be launched on the conditions for integrating the IASCF/IASB into the system of international governance e.g. the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (, the World Bank;\n",
        "4.   Stresses the need for more representatives with a European background within the international standard-setting bodies, in order to legitimate a truly international approach and to meet the need for a balanced consideration of the weight of the Community, constituting as it does by far the largest economic area and the area with the most entities applying IFRS; believes that all trustees of the IASB should come from nations that have signed up, or intend to sign up, to IFRS;\n",
        "5.   Notes the increasingly theoretical dimension of IASB projects, the complexity and theoretical nature of which are such that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, are not always able to follow them;\n",
        "6.   Notes, furthermore, that practical business aspects are not adequately reflected by the IASB; considers that, from a user's perspective, the financial statement presentation for accounting does not always lend itself to other uses, e.g. for the purposes of providing financial information to investors, performance monitoring or financial management;\n",
        "7.   Believes that there should be an open debate about accountancy standards; to this end, believes that the IASB should strengthen its due process as regards stakeholders so that the views of all IFRS users and investors are taken into account;\n",
        "8.   Takes the view, however, that governance and accountability must be improved through the following measures: (a)    by setting up a public oversight body involving all IASCF/ IASB public stakeholders including in particular legislators and supervisors; and setting up a body allowing representative market participants, including preparers and users from jurisdictions where IFRS is mandatory, to deliver annually a report on the functioning of international accounting standard setting to the governing bodies of the IASCF/IASB; (b)    such a body could be responsible for selecting and appointing the trustees in a transparent procedure ensuring both the competences of the candidates and a balanced representation of stakeholders; this would help make the appointment procedure more transparent and significantly enhance the legitimacy of the trustees; (c)    a guarantee that the composition of the IASB, the Standards Advisory Council (SAC) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) is improved and that the trustees ensure that the appointment procedure is transparent and due account is taken of the interests of various interest groups; (d)    increased involvement of the trustees in supervising the IASB and its work plan, in particular as regards the way in which the work plan is drawn up and the way in which mandates are granted to the IASB; (e)    that the IASCF constitution should ensure that the IASB develops accounting solutions that are not only technically correct but also reflect what is necessary and possible from the point of view of all users (investors and supervisors) and preparers; (f)     carrying out impact assessments for all projects, so as to check the costs and benefits (including those for user firms) of draft texts and, in particular, to highlight the implications for financial stability;\n",
        "9.   Notes that in the abovementioned combined statement the Commission seeks – as it did when it concluded a roadmap with the US authorities in April 2006 – to pre-empt solutions where it would be preferable, in the interests of effectiveness and legitimacy, to have an open consultation process and debate, to which this resolution could be a contribution;\n",
        "10. Urges that improvements to accountability and governance of the IASCF/IASB must not create excessive bureaucracy and ensure that technical issues are not unnecessarily politicised;\n",
        "11. Considers that the IASB, before embarking on the development of a standard, must take account of actual needs and of the relevant information which users (auditors, investors and supervisors) feel they require;\n",
        "12. Urges the IASB, before adopting a new standard, to carry out impact studies among all interested parties, taking account of regional diversity and market structures;\n",
        "13. Considers that, in this field, the Commission’s right of initiative should be combined with an appropriate prior consultation process;\n",
        "14.  Agrees with the Council that the measures decided on to improve the IASB governance structure must be implemented in accordance with an appropriate work plan; the same applies to the measures proposed by the Parliament;\n",
        "15. Considers that the Parliament should be involved in good time in drafting the work plan and in setting the priorities and direction of new standard setting projects; calls in this regard for an early phase consultation of the Parliament;\n",
        "16. Takes the view that the funding structure of the IASCF/IASB, currently largely based on voluntary contributions e.g. from undertakings and audit firms, gives rise to questions; calls on the IASCF/IASB notably to examine how the funding system can be amended to ensure, firstly, that all user groups are adequately involved in funding and, secondly, that no conflict of interests arises between financers and users and thirdly, that there is better and easier access to the accounting standards; calls for the Community to examine under what conditions and in what form it might consider contributing to that funding;\n",
        "17. Takes the view that transparent and stable funding for the IASCF/IASB is of crucial importance for the Community; asks the Commission to aim at a uniform funding-method involving publicly traded companies within all Member States, possibly administered by a central agency;\n",
        "18. Considers it essential that the Community express itself more coherently to ensure it has maximum influence at all stages of the process of drafting, interpreting and implementing accounting standards;\n",
        "19. Notes the contribution IFRS has made by making financial statements easier to compare across countries, across competitors within the same industry sector and across industry sectors;\n",
        "20. Notes the merits of IFRS, which do not just concern technical accounting aspects but also bring benefits to capital markets and to the European Union as a world leader;\n",
        "21. Notes that the Roundtable for the consistent application of the IFRS in the EU[5]launched by the Commission at the beginning of this legislative period did not live up to expectations surrounding its ability to give clear expression to the Community point of view and interests;\n",
        "22. Stresses that consistency in adoption and application is essential to the success of the IFRS, but recalls that these are principle-based standards and that, therefore, consistency should not be pursued to the detriment of professional judgement;\n",
        "23. Agrees with the Council on the point that the conclusions of the abovementioned Roundtable  must be taken into account to a much greater extent in the IASB work on standards;\n",
        "24. Notes that there are numerous players involved in the Community endorsement procedure; points out, in particular, that the Commission receives input from a number of players whose competences clearly overlap; points out that this overlap offers potential for enhancing efficiency and transparency;\n",
        "25. Considers that the tools the Community has for making its views known (Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC), EFRAG) do not allow it to deal on an equal footing with states whose structures are founded on the centralised powers of regulators and supervisors (e.g. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and SEC for the USA, Accounting Standards Board(ASBJ) and Financial Services Authority for Japan);\n",
        "26. Takes the view that creating a more streamlined EU structure, taking into account national structures for accounting issues could, especially if, where appropriate, some existing bodies were abolished, contribute to simplification and thereby also strengthen the role that the EU should play at global level; calls on the Commission to develop and put forward a proposal, in consultation with the Parliament, the Member States and Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) to establish a EU structure constituting a legitimate international partner and guaranteeing uniform interpretation and application of standards;\n",
        "27. Expresses satisfaction with the way in which it has exercised its authority in this field and points out that, within the framework of the revised comitology procedure, the Parliament will be even more involved in the development and endorsement of international accounting standards; notes, however, that Parliament is formally involved only in the last phase of the endorsement procedure; calls for a guarantee, as a time-saving measure, that the Parliament will already be involved in the procedure when the IASB work programme is drawn up and a draft new accounting standard is considered, in order to avoid a EU version of IFRS or the need for subsequent modifications;\n",
        "28. Believes it would be to the detriment of EU publicly traded companies if carve-outs from  IFRS are used other than as a last resort;\n",
        "29. Asks that an accounting standard should be drawn up and modified only when it has been ensured that there is a clear and beneficial need for it, and following a proper preliminary consultation process;\n",
        "30. Takes the view that particular attention should be paid to at least the following aspects: (a)  IASB framework (conceptual basis of the IASB work): points out in this connection that financial statements are drawn up not only for capital market investors but also for a range of other players such as creditors, employees, public authorities, owners, customers, etc.; (b)  IAS/IFRS branding (presentation of financial statements): points out in this connection that the IASB should bring about solutions that take account of the needs of the various jurisdictions which have made IFRS mandatory; (c)  IAS 32 and IAS 39: calls on the IASB in this connection to incorporate in IAS 32 a definition of 'own funds' which will enable all forms of company, including in particular cooperative societies and partnerships, to declare capital provided by shareholders as own funds in the balance-sheet, and to adopt a solution for hedge accounting based on banking organisations’ actual risk management practice; (d)  business combinations (accounting for acquisition of another business): points out in this connection that the IASB should draw up solutions regarding the scope of application of the fair-value principle; (e)  fair-value measurement: takes the view that the IASB should take its decision on the basis of the outcome of the consultations and, given the apparent impact of this, limit the scope of the fair-value principle; (f)   service concessions (agreements under which an entity – the concession operator – by contract with a concession provider – usually a government – receives a right and incurs an obligation to provide public services): points out in this connection that balanced solutions must be found; and (g)  performance reporting (display and presentation of all recognised changes in assets and liabilities from transactions or other events except those related to transactions with owners): points out in this connection that balanced solutions must be found.\n",
        "31. Takes the view that application of the fair-value principle can be costly for companies and can lead to unrealistic valuations e.g. in the absence of actual markets giving assessment can be less indicative of the true value of companies;\n",
        "32. Considers, in view of the potential links between IFRS and taxation, that the drafting, entry into force and interpretation of these standards could have an immense impact on the Member States;\n",
        "33. Welcomes the practice, developed since the beginning of this legislative period by its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of holding an annual hearing with the Chairperson of the IASB and informal meetings with members of the IASCF, and calls, in future for the chairpersons of the IASCF and the IASB to report to the Parliament at least once a year on all matters relevant to Parliament (including work programme, staff decisions, funding and controversial standards);\n",
        "34. Expresses concern, while supporting the IASB's intention to improve existing standards, that making continual adjustments, and even small changes, can be costly and result in expensive changes for large companies; believes that any changes should only happen when deemed necessary following a cost-benefit analysis;\n",
        "35. Notes that the IASB is carrying out broad-based consultation and field tests on its exposure draft on a standard for SMEs; requests that more serious attention be paid to the results obtained from such consultations and field testing than has been the case with  this exposure draft; underlines that this is necessary if the EU ever should begin considering taking account of the IFRS for SMEs or adopting EU standards for SMEs with the aim of converging with IFRS for SMEs;\n",
        "36. Considers that there is a widely shared view among SMEs that the standard IFRS proposed by the IASB is far too complicated for SMEs and, in addition, refers in many places to the full IFRS; takes the view that the obligations regarding appendices are too comprehensive and that the effort required is disproportionate in relation to the requirement to provide information; is concerned that the draft was designed with relatively large SMEs in mind (over fifty employees) and asserts that most SMEs are smaller in size; notes that SMEs are also concerned that the IASB intends to change the standard every two years; nevertheless, notes it could be a useful optional transition for larger, expanding SMEs, but underlines that this shall not be a waystation for enforced harmonisation;\n",
        "37. Underlines that no political mandate has been conferred on the IASB to develop IFRS for SMEs; points out that the Community endorsement procedure applies only to international accounting standards for publicly traded companies and is not envisaged with regard to the IFRS for SMEs;\n",
        "38. Notes that the endorsement procedure applies only to international accounting standards and interpretations for publicly traded companies; notes further that the endorsement procedure may not be used for the recognition of IFRS for SMEs;\n",
        "39. Would propose to assess first whether EU SMEs will derive any benefits from a standard developed by the IASB; notes that generally the IASB considers itself as a standard setter in the interest of capital market investors; acknowledges that the IASB confirms in its 'basis for conclusions' that SMEs face different requirements to those for capital market investors; questions whether the balance relating to SMEs is currently sufficient in the IASB; acknowledges though that from other parts of the world there may be a request to develop a standard for SMEs and proposes that a more precise assessment of this demand be undertaken; underlines that this is without prejudice to the EU acceptance of a subsequent standard;\n",
        "40. Takes the view that promoting (or encouraging) the voluntary use of IFRS is not without risks; takes the view that, should a few Member States decide to apply the final IFRS for SMEs in the form decided on by the IASB, this could lead to fragmentation of the internal market and might even prejudice accounting for SMEs across the entire EU;\n",
        "41. Points out that the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives provide the legal framework for the annual accounts of European SMEs and that it still has to be clarified how the IFRS for SMEs proposed by the IASB relates to the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives; considers that the Fourth and Seventh Company Law  Directives could be the basis for accounting requirements for EU SMEs, including partnerships;\n",
        "42. Considers that the EU should carefully assess the respective benefits of committing to an IFRS standard for SMEs or developing its own independent and comprehensive solution for SMEs; takes the view, furthermore, that any such EU solution could fit into the IFRS conceptual framework without obliging SMEs to use the full IFRS; considers, moreover, that the fact that the application of the fair-value principle to financial assets and liabilities does not always produce realistic valuations must be taken into consideration;\n",
        "43. Takes the view that accounting requirements for EU SMEs must be tailored to the needs of users; advises, against this background, that user needs be analysed in detail once again;\n",
        "44. In the light of the foregoing, encourages the Commission to continue its activities with regard to the simplification of company law, accounting and auditing for SMEs via the relevant legislative acts, in particular the Fourth and Seventh Company Law Directives;\n",
        "45. Points out that accounting rules exert a very strong influence on the whole field of commercial law, and that a new standard will have a wide-ranging effect here, e.g. will have a major impact in practice on national legislation on company taxation; notes that an international standard based on the fair-value principle is opposed to the principle of capital maintenance which predominates in other jurisdictions, and is not always in the best (tax) interests of SMEs;\n",
        "46. Takes the view that a standard for SMEs must take into consideration the fact that there are different forms of undertaking in the EU (such as partnerships and cooperatives); believes, therefore, that a standard must contain a clear definition of 'own funds' that takes account of the particular needs of SMEs;\n",
        "47. Regrets that the draft IFRS for SMEs do not take adequate account of the fact that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are mainly personal shareholders, creditors, business partners and employees rather than anonymous investors as in the case of public companies, and that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are interested in a long-term business relationship rather than a short-term investment;\n",
        "48. Calls on the Commission to arrange a proper consultation procedure for a EU accounting framework for SMEs along the lines of normal legislative proposals, and to withdraw its commitment to implementing and adopting an IFRS SME standard as well as preventing parallel application in the EU as long as the EU internal process has not been concluded; encourages the Commission to consider the opportunity for reduction of administrative burden for SMEs in the field of accounting and auditing;\n",
        "49. Acknowledges, however that there is an overall need for simplification of accounting and auditing measures for SMEs, while recalling that SMEs are creators of jobs and a motor of economic growth;\n",
        "50. Recalls that the ultimate aim of all international stakeholders must be the adoption of IFRS; acknowledges the tension between the intention of achieving maximum convergence and the desire to preserve the EU's full competence to deviate from the consensus that is globally achievable; emphasises that deviations from global standards should be restricted to the minimum necessary both in the EU and in other parts of the world; takes the view that third countries should deal with EU as a whole and not treat the 27 Member States differently and that the ongoing processes of convergence with existing systems can only be accepted as intermediate stages;\n",
        "51. Notes the importance and desirability of the establishment of global standards and convergence and recognises that global convergence of accounting standards is proceeding at an ever-increasing pace;\n",
        "52. Supports the idea of convergence and equivalence; emphasises, however, that convergence with certain third-country standards must be based on a prior assessment of the merits and impact of such a change on EU preparers and users of financial statements and especially on SMEs, and calls on the IASB to bear this in mind when proceeding; believes that convergence would be sufficient if a company's accounts produced in accordance with IFRS could be accepted and recognised under US GAAP without any significant extra cost to companies;\n",
        "53. Notes that the work on convergence is progressing, and sees a danger that it will be mainly large third countries' economic and company law frameworks which are taken into account in this process while EU frameworks play a lesser role;\n",
        "54. Notes that on 20 June 2007 the SEC submitted a proposal to the effect that financial statements by foreign issuers should be approved without reconciliation being required, provided that they had been prepared on the basis of the English version of IFRS adopted by the IASB; stresses that the IFRS standards incorporated by the European Union into existing law must be recognised by the SEC;\n",
        "55. Welcomes the progress made in the EU-US Accounting Roadmap and the recent announcement from the SEC to allow foreign private issuers to submit financial statements in IFRS without reconciliation to US GAAP; supports the approach outlined by the Commission in its letter to the SEC of 26 September 2007;\n",
        "56. Recalls that the EU's determination to require all publicly traded companies to use IFRS in their consolidated financial statements from the beginning of 2005 was a key element in the increased global interest in IFRS;\n",
        "57. Recalls that on 30 April 2007 the President of the United States of America, the President-in-Office of the European Council and the President of the European Commission signed Joint EU-US statement following the annual summit which on the issue of financial reporting contains the following: 'Financial markets. Promote and seek to ensure conditions for the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and International Financial Reporting Standards to be recognised in both jurisdictions without the need for reconciliation by 2009 or possibly sooner';\n",
        "58. Recalls the outstanding issue of competence between different jurisdictions applying  IFRS regarding the definitive interpretation thereof, which harbours the risk of conflicting interpretations; points out that only European authorities and courts may make a definitive interpretation of the European IFRS and calls on the Commission to ensure that this remains the case; the Commission, working together with the Member States and the European Parliament, must develop a system which will guarantee that IFRS is interpreted and applied uniformly within the European Union; o o        o\n",
        "59. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, CESR, the IASCF and IASB.\n"
