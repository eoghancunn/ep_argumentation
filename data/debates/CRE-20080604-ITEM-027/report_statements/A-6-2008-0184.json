    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Stresses the importance of effective import and export rules and procedures for the implementation of trade policy;\n",
        "2.   Points out that the effectiveness of any trade policy measure depends largely on the Union’s ability to ensure it is properly enforced; this concerns, in particular, trade defence measures and all kinds of tariff preferences that the Union grants to its various partners; a measure that is unenforceable, or difficult to enforce, from the customs standpoint is a measure that is ineffective from the trade standpoint, since it can lead to serious distortions of competition and huge economic, social and/or environmental collateral damage;\n",
        "3.   Deplores the fact that the ‘customs feasibility’ of certain trade policy initiatives is not always properly assessed and taken into account; draws attention, for example, to the problems encountered in 2005 in implementing the Memorandum of Understanding with China on textile imports;\n",
        "4.   Stresses the need for better cooperation between the Commission departments responsible for trade policy and those responsible for customs policy, in particular by including the latter more systematically in the teams which negotiate trade agreements;\n",
        "5.   Calls on the Commission to pay particular attention to the problems encountered by SMEs, in particular by facilitating the process of adapting their IT systems to those employed by customs administrations, at the lowest possible cost, and by simplifying the procedures for securing 'authorised economic operator' status;\n",
        "6.   Welcomes the admission of the European Community to the WCO as a full member with effect from 1 July 2007, a step which formally recognises its international competence in the sphere of customs policy and which can help to strengthen its internal cohesion; calls on the Commission to support the WCO;\n",
        "7.   Points out the particular importance of the rules concerning the tariff classification, value and origin – preferential and non-preferential – of goods;\n",
        "8.   Encourages the Commission to strive continuously to improve these rules, both at Community level and in the multilateral contexts of the WTO and the WCO, making them more transparent, predictable, simple and effective;\n",
        "9.   Deplores the persistent deadlock in the multilateral harmonisation exercise concerning non-preferential rules of origin, which began as early as 1995 on the basis of the Agreement on Rules of Origin (ARO) concluded in the Uruguay Round; believes that such harmonisation would, inter alia, enable trade defence measures throughout the world to be applied more effectively and fairly and would provide a better framework for origin marking practices; calls on the Commission to take all possible measures with a view to restarting and concluding these negotiations on the basis of the principles laid down in the ARO;\n",
        "10. Notes the efforts made by the Commission with a view to modernising and simplifying the rules on preferential origin;\n",
        "11. Deplores the fact that Parliament is not more closely involved, so as to enable it to exercise the right of prior scrutiny it enjoys under the comitology procedure, in considering the draft regulation on the reform of the rules of origin of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), currently under consideration by the Member States in the context of the Customs Code Committee, in spite of the importance and great political sensitivity of this reform; notes, however, that the Commission is due to deliver a presentation on the subject to the parliamentary committee responsible;\n",
        "12. Notes the strong objections from certain Community industrial sectors, such as textiles, clothing and agri-foodstuffs, with regard to the uniform application of the value-added criterion; calls on the Commission and on the Member States to take account of these justified criticisms as far as possible;\n",
        "13. Notes that it is important in general terms to ensure that the preferences granted to countries benefiting from preferential arrangements in certain sensitive sectors do not, by virtue of excessively flexible rules of origin, lend themselves too easily to being exploited by very competitive third countries;\n",
        "14. Deplores the fact that European firms are making little use of Community 'customs warehousing' and outward and inward processing procedures owing to their complexity;  calls on the Commission to consider simplifying the 'procedures with economic impact', introducing more flexible procedures and a paperless system;\n",
        "15. Attaches the utmost importance to the trade facilitation negotiations under way since August 2004 in the WTO; points out the considerable benefits that are expected from an ambitious agreement in terms of reducing transaction costs, improving the competitiveness and international attractiveness of developing countries and promoting trade;\n",
        "16. Acknowledges the risk that the outcome of the negotiations on trade facilitation could impose obligations on developing countries to undertake expensive programmes that they can ill afford; regards it as essential, therefore, that, as part of the eventual outcome of the negotiations, the developed countries give a clear commitment to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries in order to enable them to meet the compliance, adjustment and implementation costs of any future multilateral framework;\n",
        "17. Underlines the eminently cooperative nature of these negotiations, which do not lend themselves to any cross-sector bargaining involving other issues in the Doha Round; considers that the issue of trade facilitation could be concluded and implemented separately, without disrupting the Round, and therefore calls for it to be removed from the Single Undertaking;\n",
        "18. Also supports the Commission's ambitious plans to include a chapter on facilitating trade and customs cooperation in all the new free trade agreements it negotiates, in line with its Communication of 4 October 2006 entitled 'Global Europe: Competing in the World – a contribution to the EU's growth and jobs strategy' (COM(2006)0567);\n",
        "19. Reiterates the need to establish at European Union level a plan to combat counterfeiting and piracy, and stresses the need for enhanced cooperation on this subject within the Commission, in other words between the departments responsible for intellectual property rules, trade policy and customs policy, with the Member States' customs authorities and between those authorities;\n",
        "20. Welcomes the compromise reached by the Member States and the Commission on a negotiating mandate for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which is an important element of the Union's global trade strategy and will provide a high-level international framework for strengthening the enforcement of intellectual property rights and protecting producers against industrial theft and consumers against the health and safety risks associated with many counterfeit products;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure that goods imported with a view to being placed on the European Union market comply with European consumer protection standards, particularly as regards health and safety, to prevent the circulation of products or substances which could be dangerous for consumers;\n",
        "22. Acknowledges the legitimacy of concerns relating to the security of people and goods, but stresses the need to strike a fair balance between control and facilitation; regards, however, the role of customs in the full application of Community measures concerning health, the environment and consumer protection as a priority that must not be compromised by customs facilitation measures;\n",
        "23. Supports the SAFE Framework of Standards (to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade) adopted by the WCO Council in 2005; fully endorses the opinion expressed by the WCO that ‘it is an unacceptable and an unnecessary burden to inspect every shipment’ and that priority should be given to managing risks effectively by means of efficient automated systems;\n",
        "24. Deeply deplores the adoption by the US Congress in July 2007 of the so-called HR1 legislation and the unilateral introduction by the United States of a scanning requirement for all shipping containers bound for that country as from 2012; doubts that such a measure will be effective and that it is compatible with WTO rules; fears that once implemented, it will curb the development of transatlantic trade;\n",
        "25. Notes that secure trade is particularly important in an ever more integrated global economy; urges the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) and the Commission to continue their efforts to ensure that the US legislation requiring the scanning of all US-bound cargo is modified in line with a risk-based approach; calls on the Commission to raise the matter in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) and other bodies and persuade the US to change its decision; calls for support to be given to mutual recognition of 'authorised economic operators' and of security standards agreed by the WCO (C-TPAT, SAFE framework);\n",
        "26. Points out that the compatibility of the Union’s customs system with WTO rules was essentially confirmed on appeal by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in the aforementioned Case WT/DS315, and welcomes this result;\n",
        "27. Notes, nevertheless, that both our trading partners and European economic operators themselves continue to call for greater harmonisation between national administrations in the implementation of Community customs legislation;\n",
        "28. Notes that pernicious discrepancies are sometimes found between Member States, for example with regard to the levying of VAT on imports, conditions for access to certain simplified procedures, the frequency of physical checks on goods and penalties;\n",
        "29. Considers that every effort must be made to ensure equal treatment for economic operators throughout the Community customs territory, as it is an essential prerequisite as regards preserving the integrity of the internal market and protecting the Union's financial interests, maintaining its powers in the area of external policy – particularly trade policy – and ensuring compliance with its international commitments;\n",
        "30. Expresses its support for all measures seeking to increase cohesion between national administrations, encourage synergies, establish new communication and information-sharing systems, develop best practices and exchange staff and experiences with a view to enabling these administrations to function as one in the application of Community legislation;\n",
        "31. Stresses the crucial importance, in this respect, of instruments such as the Community's integrated tariff (Taric), European binding tariff information (EBTI) and the common risk management framework; calls on the Commission and the Member States to continue to perfect these instruments and ensure they function properly;\n",
        "32. Stresses the need to standardise the law of evidence or establish common minimum rules and ensure uniform implementation by the 27 Member States of Community customs regulations (and in particular Regulation (EC) 1383/2003);\n",
        "33. Calls on the Commission to incorporate in its proposals precise rules on the administrative and penal sanctions for infringing the customs provisions laid down in Articles 27(a) and 280 of the EC Treaty as they would be amended by the Lisbon Treaty;\n",
        "34. Criticises the reluctance of the Commission and the Member States to envisage, at this stage, new structures to ensure that Community customs legislation is applied in a uniform manner; calls on the Commission and the Member States to seriously consider the possibility of establishing a unified European Union customs service to enable customs rules and procedures to be implemented more effectively throughout the European Union's customs territory; o o         o\n",
        "35. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the World Customs Organisation, the World Trade Organisation and to member countries and candidate countries.\n"
