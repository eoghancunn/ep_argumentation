{"speaker": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE). - (HU) Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps not everyone knows that the first organ transplant in the world was performed in Vienna in 1902 by a person of Hungarian origin, Imre Ulmann. This particular link with the Austrian capital has existed since then, and so strongly that, even though personnel and technical resources are roughly the same, Hungarian lung transplants are still carried out in Vienna. And why not? It costs three times as much and even then the number of patients is even limited. There is no doubt but that transplant coordinators have to be appointed in the intensive care units of European hospitals. The number of these in Hungary is at present precisely zero, while Spain reportedly has 156. As regards heart transplants, my own country has outstanding results, performing well in international comparisons, but we are at the bottom of the list in Europe. The reason is the lack of donors, lack of equipment, air travel, and the human resources required. Hopefully this report will help to address these anomalies since the problem lies not in our hearts but in our minds. Thank you, and I propose that the report be adopted.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Péter Olajos (PPE-DE). - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
