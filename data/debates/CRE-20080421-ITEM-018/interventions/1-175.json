It is also a subject which in my view ought largely to be dealt with at Member State level. But a European approach may make sense, chiefly when it comes to quality criteria and information-sharing. We need to take a tough line on illegal organ trafficking. Mr Adamou’s own-initiative report makes a significant contribution here and I thank him for it.\nSome members have advocated the introduction of an ‘opting out’ system, but I have grave reservations about that. We cannot force anyone to make a choice about organ donation when the sector itself has not yet weighed the issues clearly and responsibly. I am glad that the resolution now before us makes this point a matter for the Member States.\nLastly, I endorse the amendments tabled by Mrs Sinnot, Messrs Liese and Bowis and others regarding the proven benefits of using adult stem cells.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Johannes Blokland (IND/DEM). - (NL) Mr President, previous speakers have already made the point that organ donation is an emotive subject.
