{"speaker": "Neena Gill (PSE),", "english": "Neena Gill (PSE), in writing . – This is a crucial report and a real opportunity to save lives. Chronic shortages of organs across Europe are causing 60 000 unnecessary deaths.\nTherefore, urgent action is needed:\n1. Removal of restrictions in organ donation and increased cooperation across Member States and the number of quality safe organs available for transplantation. What is required is a Commission directive that adds value and sets common EU-wide quality and safety standards which complement existing arrangements in Member States.\n2. Encourage Member States to adopt a system of ‘opting out’ rather than ‘opting in’ to organ donation. This would enable greater awareness of shortages, and would allow more people to actively consider their position on the issue.\n3. I fully support the emphasis in this report on illegal trafficking of organs. I am especially concerned that it is often the poorest who are targeted for donating organs. We must end this cruel exploitation of poverty and protect the innocent victims who are tricked into losing their organs. This is not just a problem in developing countries but also in eastern Europe. I want to see strong measures put in place through Europol and Interpol to curb this illegal trade.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill (PSE), in writing . – This is a crucial report and a real opportunity to save lives.
