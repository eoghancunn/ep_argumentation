{"speaker": "Irena Belohorská (NI). -", "english": "Irena Belohorská (NI). - (SK) Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate Dr Adamos Adamou on this report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Not a single Member voted against it; nor did anyone oppose it any of the committees that were asked for their opinion. That this unique level of consensus was achieved is also due to the frequent and long debates on this report organised by the rapporteur, and I would like to thank him for that.\nOur task in the area of organ transplantation is twofold. On the one hand, we want to help people for whom transplantation offers the only possibility of staying alive, and on the other hand, it is our duty to prevent organ trafficking, which is one of the most serious criminal acts. We know that trade in organs is at present particularly active in the poorer parts of the world, where organ donation is providing the poor with the only possibility of survival.\nI therefore find it shocking that in today’s European Union, based on values, morals and ethics, some people are asking for this trade to be legalised. Since there is a vast difference between the supply of organs – from either live or deceased donors – and the demand for organs, it is important to increase the number of donors.\nIn the Health Programme 2008-2013 the Commission includes evaluation of post-transplant results among its health safety priorities, which means that grants can be awarded for these purposes. Although I very much welcome the possibility of financing projects from grants, I have a few reservations.\nI know that this debate is not about the Health Programme 2008-2013 but I must emphasise the following aspect. As far as the projects concerned, I was surprised at the mathematical discrepancy between the number of projects approved and the number of projects completed: in 2004, 72 projects were approved and 9 were completed; in 2005, 61 projects were approved and 7 were completed; in 2006, 87 projects were approved and not a single one was completed; and in 2007, 6 projects were approved and none was completed. Are there any mechanisms available to verify the effectiveness of the projects cofinanced by the European Union?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Irena Belohorská (NI). - (SK) Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate Dr Adamos Adamou on this report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
