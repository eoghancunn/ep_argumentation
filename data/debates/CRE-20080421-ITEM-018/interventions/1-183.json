I would like the system of organ donation to be, as Mr Matsakis has said, a system into which everyone has opted in to donate, unless they have requested to opt out. That would help with the supply side, particularly for the young and those from an ethnic minority, where shortages are most acute. Such a system would help save European lives. While I welcome the Commission’s action plan, let us make sure that it is not too little, too late.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). - Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report.\nTonight, there are 700 people in Scotland waiting for an organ transplant: that is 700 families waiting for calls that could guarantee their loved ones’ survival.\nThe need for consensus on this sensitive subject is essential, and it is a sad day when Member States cannot agree on this.
