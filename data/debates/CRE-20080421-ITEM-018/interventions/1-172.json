{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). -", "english": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). - Mr President, to be reprieved from death and disease through the gift of an organ is a wonderful thing, but we have a shortage of organs. Adult stem cells are a promising development, worthy of mention. Many people who would otherwise have needed a transplant are being taken off the list, as their own stem cells are being used to repair their damaged organs. Also, in a research setting, new organs have been made for animals, using their own stem cells. Such replacement organs do not present rejection problems for the recipient.\nI would like to thank the rapporteur for supporting the amendments on equality in organ donation for people with disabilities. Research by the Disability Rights Commission suggests that people with disabilities are four times more likely to die from a treatable disease, with organ failure being one of these conditions. We must fight such institutionalised discrimination and ensure fair, free and equitable access to organ donation for all.\nI also want to congratulate Mr Derek Rowe and all those at Irish Air Ambulance who, despite receiving no support from the Irish Government, will finally have the first air ambulance operational in Ireland by the end of the year. They have based it on the Cornwall Air Ambulance. The very first mission of the Cornwall Air Ambulance involved a person who had drowned and donated four of their organs – organs that would have been lost without an air ambulance.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). - Mr President, to be reprieved from death and disease through the gift of an organ is a wonderful thing, but we have a shortage of organs.
