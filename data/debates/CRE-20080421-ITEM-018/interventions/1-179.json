{"speaker": "Gyula Hegyi (PSE). -", "english": "Gyula Hegyi (PSE). - (HU) An unreasonably large number of people die or suffer because there is no organ available in time for transplantation. But many people do not consider use of their organs after death an ethical problem, if they know that this can be done, but because of inadequate information they do not donate their organs. Naturally everyone must make their own decision, and no one can overrule them or force them. It is important, however, that citizens in our various countries understand that, with different rules in different Member States, if they do not make provision for donating their organs, some countries will permit transplantation while others do not. I welcome the European Parliament’s proposal for a legal representative to decide on the use of organs after death if the deceased person has made no other provision. The illegal trade in organs is a most loathsome crime associated with organ transplants. Robust action must be taken against it, and, especially when those who are termed allies of the west pursue it, covering up these crimes would be a collective shame.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gyula Hegyi (PSE). - (HU) An unreasonably large number of people die or suffer because there is no organ available in time for transplantation.
