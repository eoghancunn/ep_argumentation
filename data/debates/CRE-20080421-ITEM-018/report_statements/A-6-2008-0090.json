    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Welcomes the Commission Communication \"Organ Donation and Transplantation: Policy Actions at EU level\" which proposes a very much appreciated integrated three-pillar approach;\n",
        "2.   Looks forward to the Commission proposal for a Directive setting quality and safety requirements for organ donation, procurement, testing, preservation, transport and allocation across the EU and the resources needed to meet these requirements; stresses, nonetheless, that the forthcoming legislative framework should not create an additional administrative burden for Member States or service providers, nor should it jeopardize the use of existing good practices or those practices adapted to the prevailing conditions and circumstances in individual Member States, or contain requirements which would lead to a decrease in the number of potential and actual donors;\n",
        "3.   Points out that the new legislative document should complement and reinforce efforts made by Member States to achieve an active and efficient method of coordination without preventing the introduction or maintenance of more stringent measures;\n",
        "4.   Underlines that the Directive should accommodate the progress made by medical science;\n",
        "5.   Expresses its concern over the insufficiency of available organs for transplantation to meet patient needs; considers reducing the organ (and donor) shortage as the main challenge that EU Member States face with regard to organ transplantation; recalls that currently many thousands of patients in Europe are registered on waiting lists, which have a significant mortality rate;\n",
        "6.   Notes that the allocation of organs should be based on the medical capacity of the patient to accept an organ; is of the opinion that discrimination on the basis of disabilities which have no bearing on the patient's chances of accepting an organ should not be tolerated;\n",
        "7.   Points out that organ donation is a gift; therefore stresses that, while finding an answer to the severe organ shortage in Europe is extremely important, the free choice to donate or not to donate an organ needs to be respected and protected as well;\n",
        "8.   Takes note of the important differences with respect to the source of organs (deceased or living donors) within the EU, the large differences between Member States' success in increasing their donor pool, the discrepancies between Member States when it comes to quality and safety requirements, the different organisational approaches to organ donation and transplantation and the differences in education and training of medical and paramedical professionals; considers that discrepancies can be partly explained by a combination of economic, structural, administrative, cultural, ethical, religious, historical, social and legal factors, although the critical factor seems to be how the whole process leading to donation and transplantation is organised;\n",
        "9.   Strongly believes, therefore, that there is significant potential for sharing expertise between EU Member States which can increase donor rates and equalise access to transplantation across the EU; hence, looks forward to the Commission's Action Plan for strengthened cooperation between Member States in order to: ·increase organ availability, ·enhance the efficiency and accessibility of transplantation systems, ·increase public awareness, ·guarantee quality and safety;\n",
        "10. Consequently, stresses that the establishment of well-structured operational systems and the promotion of successful models in and between Member States, and where appropriate at international level, are of the utmost importance; suggests that operational systems should comprise an adequate legal framework, technical and logistic infrastructure, psychological and organisational support and an appropriate organisational structure, at hospital and supra-hospital level, equipped with highly qualified staff, coupled with clear provisions on traceability and a fair, effective and equitable allocation and access to transplantation system;\n",
        "11. Points out that Member States are responsible for their own legal model; notes that in the EU two models exist, each with different variants; considers it unnecessary to adapt or harmonise legal systems; invites Member States to introduce into their legislation the possibility to appoint a legal representative who can decide on donation after one's death;\n",
        "12. Calls on Member States to achieve the full potential of post mortem donations; therefore urges Member States to invest to the full in improving their organisational system by: ·sensitizing, educating and training medical and paramedical staff, ·supporting hospitals financially to appoint \"in-house transplant coordinators\" (doctors working inside the intensive care units who are supported by a medical team); their task would be to actively identify potential donors and approach their families, ·implementing quality improvement programmes in every hospital or cluster of hospitals across Europe where there is proven evidence of potential for organ donation;\n",
        "13. Asks Member States, with a view to increasing organ availability, to evaluate the use of \"expanded\" donors (older donors, donors with certain diseases) taking into account quality and safety aspects;\n",
        "14. Considers that transplants can be carried out using a sub-optimal organ; it would then be for the transplant team, acting in consultation with the patient and/or his or her family, to make decisions about the use of organs for individual patients on the basis of a risk-benefit analysis;\n",
        "15. Also notes that, in order to ensure swift identification of organs, it is important to encourage those who are not suitable donors to carry a card to that effect;\n",
        "16. Asks Member States allowing living donation to take into account quality and safety aspects; stresses, however, that living donation should be seen as complementary to post mortem donation;\n",
        "17. Recognises that when the donor pool is expanded, doctors may be concerned about the increased likelihood of rejection of the organs and gradual decline of the function of the grafted organ, and therefore asks the Commission and Member States to support methods to prevent and treat organ rejection so that the “expanded” organ pool can be used with confidence by doctors;\n",
        "18. Recognises that biotechnology is already offering solutions to the risk of rejection of transplanted organs, for example through treatments that reduce rates of rejection, which will in turn support the availability of more organs, by allowing doctors to treat or even prevent rejection; argues that this would help support the “expanded” donor pool, by reducing the risk associated with expanded organ programmes;\n",
        "19. Asks Member States to remove, before January 2010, legislation that reserves donor organs for use solely within that country;\n",
        "20. Asks Member States to take the necessary measures in the areas of education and training, teamwork and remuneration of transplantation surgeons;\n",
        "21. Stresses the importance of financing organ procurement and transplantation under a dedicated budget line, so as not to make transplantation a disincentive for hospitals;\n",
        "22.  Underlines the need to ensure that organ donations stay strictly non-commercial;\n",
        "23. Endorses measures which aim at protecting living donors, from a medical as well as a psychological and social point of view, and ensuring that organ donation is made altruistically and voluntarily, ruling out payments between donors and recipients, any payment being confined solely to compensation which is strictly limited to making good the expense and inconvenience related to the donation; asks Member States to ensure that the anonymity of deceased donors and living donors not genetically or emotionally linked to recipients, where national legislation permits such donations, is preserved; urges Member States to define the conditions under which compensation can be granted;\n",
        "24. Urges the Member States to adopt or maintain strict legal provisions in connection with transplantation from unrelated living donors, in order to make the system transparent and exclude the possibility of illicit organ selling or coercion of donors; thus, donations by unrelated living donors could only be made under the conditions defined in national law and following authorisation by a suitable independent body;\n",
        "25. Urges the Member States to ensure that living donors will not be discriminated against, in particular by insurance systems;\n",
        "26. Urges Member States to ensure the reimbursement of the social security costs of living donors;\n",
        "27. Considers that, in the future, provided that  traceability is guaranteed, biotechnology may offer the possibility for researchers to grow organs from existing tissues and cells, either from the patients themselves or from other tissue donors; asks the Commission to promote such research, which is often carried out by Europe’s emerging SME biotech companies within the cultural and ethical frameworks laid down in the Member States and in the Charter on Fundamental Rights and the Convention on biomedicine of the Council of Europe;\n",
        "28. Takes note that, although several Member States have introduced compulsory registration of transplant activities and some voluntary registers also exist, no comprehensive system exists to collect data on the different types of transplantation and their outcomes; strongly recommends the creation of national follow-up registers of living donors, transplanted patients and transplant procedures; points out that the registers must be regularly updated; stresses that the comparability of the data between EU Member States is important;\n",
        "29. Asks the Commission to recommend to the Member States certain guidelines as far as registration is concerned to ensure that the registered person submits certain information about his medical history and to ensure the quality and safety of the donor's organs, since registration is not only the simple act of registering by name but implies consequences for both the donor and the recipient;\n",
        "30. Invites the Commission to facilitate the development of a core of technical and ethical standards for the management of the safety, quality and efficacy of organ donation in the context of donation and transplantation that can serve as a model for Member States; asks the Commission to establish an EU mechanism which would promote coordination activities between Member States in relation to organ donation and transplantation;\n",
        "31. Considers that an additional benefit of collaboration between EU Member States which is insufficiently emphasised in the Commission's Communication is the potential value of organ sharing between EU Member States in terms of medical and technical opportunities, always taking account of the geographical limitations to such exchanges and the potential effects on organ viability; underlines in this respect the good results of international systems; believes that organ sharing can be very helpful particularly as far as difficult transplant procedures are concerned (e.g. highly sensitised or urgent patients and patients with special conditions, for whom it is difficult to find a suitable donor);\n",
        "32. Invites the Commission together with the Member States to conduct a study on all matters concerning organ transplantation for non-EU residents in Member States and to develop a code of conduct containing rules and conditions under which organs donated by deceased EU donors may be allocated to non-EU residents;\n",
        "33. Emphasises that good co-operation between health professionals and responsible authorities is necessary and provides added value; asks the Commission to facilitate alliances between national transplantation organisations in Member States involving cooperation at legal, ethical and technical level; recognises that there are situations in transplant medicine that cannot be adequately addressed in Member States with a limited donor pool; believes that small Member States, in particular, could clearly benefit from European co-operation;\n",
        "34. Calls for a European donor card, complementary to existing national systems;\n",
        "35. Considers that international co-operation to promote availability and safety of organs is desirable; points out, in this regard, that general rules governing best medical practice, diagnostic techniques and conservation would be useful; asks Member States to actively promote such cooperation and to apply this system of general rules;\n",
        "36. Underlines the importance of increasing public awareness on organ donation and transplantation since it can facilitate the identification of organ donors and thus increase organ availability; hence, calls on the Commission, Member States and civil society to structurally enhance the promotion of organ donation, inter alia among youngsters in schools; in this regard, suggests using well known personalities (e.g. sportsmen and sportswomen) and educational packs;\n",
        "37. Points out that information on organ donation and transplantation should be provided in a transparent, unbiased and non-directive manner, addressing the scope of organ donations, i.e. that donation might include multiple-organ donations as well as tissue donations;\n",
        "38. Underlines that the free choice to donate or not to donate an organ needs to be respected and that organ donation must be considered as a gift from one human being to another; points out that this needs to be reflected in the language used, avoiding economic terminology which suggests that organs may be treated as a commodity of the internal market;\n",
        "39. Calls on the Commission to take into consideration the further development and expansion of the existing European web page on organ donationwww.eurodonor.org(and/orwww.eurocet.org), as well as that of the WHO (www.transplant-observatory.org),  to cover all EU Member States, in all official EU languages, with the aim of providing all relevant information and data on organ donation and transplantation;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Commission and Member States to promote the World Donor Day and recommends actions that underline the good results and importance of transplantation;\n",
        "41. Is convinced that a very effective way of increasing organ availability is to provide more information to the public also at the local and regional level; calls on the Commission, the Member States and the organisations of civil society, churches, religious and humanist communities to take part in this effort to raise public awareness of the possibility of organ donation whilst taking into account the cultural particularities in each Member State; underlines the important role played by registered donors in promoting organ donation among family members and friends and encouraging them to become donors themselves;\n",
        "42. Acknowledges that it is important to improve the communication skills of health professionals by, for instance, developing information guidelines; stresses the need for a professional attitude towards communication, as well as support from experts in that field; special attention should be paid to both the content of the message and the best means of dealing with the most controversial topics; stresses the importance of regular meetings with media representatives to promote the good results and importance of transplantation;\n",
        "43. Favours the establishment of a transplant \"hotline\" with a single telephone number which is managed by a national transplantation organisation, where such an organisation exists, and manned 24 hours/day by appropriately trained and experienced professionals who can provide relevant and accurate information rapidly (medical, legal) to all actors concerned;\n",
        "44. Asks the Commission to support research into organ donation and transplantation across national boundaries to address the impact of ethnicity, country of origin, religion, level of education and socio-economic class on the decision to offer organs for donation; asks the Commission and Member States to disseminate rapidly the outcomes of research with a view to informing the public and altering misperceptions;\n",
        "45. Recognises that it is vitally important to ensure the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation; points out that this will have an impact on reducing transplant risks and will consequently reduce adverse effects; acknowledges that actions on quality and safety could have an effect on organ availability and vice versa; asks the Commission to help Member States develop their capacity in creating and developing national regulations and a regulatory framework to enhance quality and safety, without this having a negative impact on the availability of transplant organs;\n",
        "46. Acknowledges that post-transplant and post-donation results should be monitored and evaluated; stresses that a common methodology of data analysis should be promoted, on the basis of the best practices currently employed by Member States, in order to allow optimal comparability of results across countries;\n",
        "47. Asks Member States to increase the monitoring times for transplant patients (currently between nine and twelve months) to several years and preferably for as long as the patient lives and/or the graft still functions;\n",
        "48. Calls on the Commission to allocate funds within the Seventh Framework programme to promote research on better and more sensitive diagnostic techniques which will enable early and effective detection of harmful conditions such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and others, since an important aspect of organ transplantation is to secure safety from various detrimental factors and agents existing in the organs of the donor;\n",
        "49. Points out that there is a link between organ shortage and organ trafficking, in that organ trafficking undermines the credibility of the system for potential voluntary and unpaid donors; emphasises that any commercial exploitation of organs is unethical and inconsistent with the most basic human values; stresses that organ donation out of financial motivation degrades the gift of an organ to a mere commodity which constitutes a violation of human dignity and contravenes Article 21 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and is prohibited according to Article 3(2) of the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights;\n",
        "50. Asks the Commission, in relation to third countries, to fight against the practice of organ and tissue trafficking, which should be universally banned, including the transplantation of organs and tissues from minors, from the mentally disabled or from executed prisoners; calls on the Commission and the Member States to raise the awareness of the international community on this issue;\n",
        "51. Considers that, in order to fight against organ trafficking in the poorer parts of the world, a long-term strategy must be adopted so as to abolish the social inequalities lying at the root of such practices; stresses that, in order to combat the practice of organ selling for money (especially in countries of the developing world), mechanisms of traceability should be put in place so as to prevent these organs entering the European Union;\n",
        "52. Calls on the Commission and Member States to take measures to prevent 'transplant tourism', by drawing up guidelines to protect the poorest and most vulnerable donors from being victims of organ trafficking, adopting measures that increase the availability of legally procured organs and by exchange of waiting list registrations between existing organ exchange organisations to avoid multiplied listing; asks the Commission to promote via the Justice, Freedom and Security area a common approach which aims at compiling information on national organ trafficking legislation and to identify the main problems and potential solutions; points out to this effect that a system of traceability and accountability of human material has to be established;\n",
        "53. Urges the Member States, where necessary, to amend their criminal codes to ensure that those responsible for organ trafficking are adequately prosecuted, including sanctions for medical staff involved in transplantation of organs obtained from trafficking, while making every effort to discourage potential recipients from seeking trafficked organs and tissues; this should include the consideration of criminal liability of European citizens who have purchased organs inside or outside the Union;\n",
        "54. Calls on the Member States to take the necessary steps to restrain healthcare professionals from facilitating organ and tissue trafficking (i.e. referring a patient to a foreign transplant service, which might be involved in trafficking) as well as health insurance providers from facilitating activities that directly or indirectly promote trafficking in organs, for instance, reimbursing costs incurred in obtaining an illegal organ transplantation;\n",
        "55. Considers that the Member States should ensure the training of their law enforcement agencies as well as medical staff on trafficking in organs in order to report each known case to the police;\n",
        "56. Asks Member States to sign, ratify and implement the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and the Palermo Protocol if they have not already done so;\n",
        "57. Asks the Commission and Europol to improve monitoring of cases of organ trafficking;\n",
        "58. Asks the Commission and the Council to update the Action Plan on Trafficking in human beings and include in it an action plan for the fight against trafficking in organs, in order to enable closer cooperation among the authorities concerned;\n",
        "59. Calls, in addition, for the action plan to make reference to data which are correct and verified concerning the quantities, types and origin of illegally-trafficked organs; 0 0     0\n",
        "60. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the WHO, the Council of Europe and the Parliaments of Member States.\n"
