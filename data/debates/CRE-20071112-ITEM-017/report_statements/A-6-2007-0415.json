        "19.Encourages Member States to modernise and improve their physical education policies - principally to ensure that a balance is struck between physical and intellectual activities in schools - to invest in quality sports facilities and take appropriate measures to make sports premises and sports curricula at schools accessible to all students, with proper regard being paid to the needs of disabled students; suggests that support is forthcoming for a wide range of sporting activities so that every student has a real opportunity to participate in different sports; calls on the Member States to support the requirement to increase the time spent on physical education in schools; to promote the legal recognition of institutions and organisations which contribute to better integration of sports activities in schools and preschools; favours granting incentives to sports clubs having collaboration agreements with schools, educational establishments, youth centres, and other community or voluntary organisations involved in lifelong learning projects;\n",
