        "2.   Recalls the decisions of the European Council in October 2005 which set out the challenges which the European Union should take account of in a globalising world; believes that the Annual Policy Strategy does not reflect the urgency with which such challenges should be addressed or provide the necessary vision for encouraging economic reform to meet them;\n",
        "3.   Given that the year 2007 will be the first budget of a new MFF, considers that this budget should be strategic in nature, looking at those areas of external and internal policies where funding can make a significant difference and which provide real value for money;\n",
        "4.   Notes the Commission's strategic objectives as set out in its APS document \"Boosting trust through action\"; although sharing its analysis, strongly criticises the Commission for its complacency and laid back attitude in setting out the nature of the challenges facing the European Union; believes, for example, that insufficient attention has been given by the Commission to the vast and very rapid changes underway in the global economy, notably in emerging economies such as China and India;\n",
        "5.   Intends to make the best possible use of resources a fundamental issue for the 2007 budget, taking into account the coherence between various actions, their effectiveness and their added value for citizens; believes that the three main strands of the 2007 budget should be setting policy priorities; ensuring qualitative value for money; and beginning preparations for the review in 2008/2009, this because the 2007 budget and its implementation will enable the effectiveness of the new financial framework to be assessed;\n",
        "6.   Considers with regard to setting policy priorities that under reduced ceilings compared to initial expectation, the 2007 budget should concentrate on a limited number of priorities, in particular:\n",
        "7.   Considers that it is its responsibility as budgetary and discharge authority to ensure that the funding allocated to the EU budget is spent with a view to ensuring qualitative value for money, in particular to optimise the resources made available under limited ceilings; therefore intends to address the 2007 budget with a cost-benefit approach by developing a qualitative scrutiny of the budget through annual assessment, in close co-operation with the sectoral committees;\n",
        "8.   Recalls the importance of a mid-term review of the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF) with the aim of adjusting the financial framework to enable the EU to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world more effectively; believes that the 2007 Budget as the first under the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 offers an important opportunity to set a direction for implementation of the new programmes and thereby lay the grounds for the comprehensive review of the MFF planned for 2008;\n",
        "9.   Recalls that the  MFF should not be considered as a multi-annual budget; therefore asks the Commission to present a Preliminary draft budget (PDB) which leaves a sufficient margin for manoeuvre for the 2007 annual procedure in respect of the co-decided programmes;\n",
        "10. Underlines that the foundation of the EU is based on a number of core values such as peace, freedom and democracy and the need to promote international relations in order to foster these goals; takes the view that the essence of these values is sometimes obscured by the multitude and diverse character of the different types of international agreements and instruments and believes that the EU, in political terms as well as in terms of budgetary guidance, should now develop a coherent and over-arching strategy to better define its strategic priorities; this should include devoting special attention to how new programmes function and how they are relevant to the strategic objectives; looks forward to a report from the Commission on effective external action, within the existing rules of the Treaty;\n",
        "11. Firmly believes that partnerships that share fundamental core values must be recognised and promoted as such; underlines the crucial importance it attaches to the  re-launching of a deepened and more strategic partnership with the United States on many global issues, on the basis of shared objectives between the two continents;\n",
        "12. Welcomes the inclusion of enhanced policy coherence and reinforced aid effectiveness among the Commission's priorities in the field of external action;\n",
        "13. Highlights its concern about the further development of avian influenza in and outside the European Union; stresses the need to cooperate closely with the FAO, the WHO, the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) and with the countries in the affected regions;\n",
        "14. Reiterates its support for the European Neighbourhood Policy which it considers crucial, especially in terms of promoting democracy and positive change through a set of policies which establish clear benefits, also in economic and trading terms, for reforms undertaken and progress made; is convinced that actions in this area, leading over time also to economic development, will have important benefits for the partner countries and the EU alike;\n",
        "15. Believes that it is important to ensure sufficient funding for development policy and poverty alleviation measures, including the Millennium Development Goals; strongly emphasises that sustainable solutions are also dependent on sufficient internal progress in the countries concerned, including respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights; underlines the crucial importance of paying special attention to the coherence and complementarity of national and Community programmes in order to maximise overall impact and effectiveness; requests a detailed examination of programmes on democratisation and human rights as well as the functioning of some NGOs;\n",
        "16. Reminds the Commission and the Council of their commitment to provide the Sugar Protocol countries with adequate and appropriate funding for accompanying measures to help address the transitional challenges they face as a result of   the EU internal reform of the sugar regime and the relevant WTO ruling;\n",
        "17. Stresses that developments in the Middle East and particularly Palestine should be carefully assessed during the budget procedure and draws particular attention to the likelihood of chaos that would follow a collapse of the Palestinian Authority and the need for sound financial and fiscal management concerning EU aid, whether disbursed directly or through the trust funds established; wishes to make absolutely clear that the budgetary authority must be consulted in advance before any substantial financial commitments can be entered into;\n",
        "18. Is determined to develop the established political dialogue on CFSP in a constructive manner and urges the Council to use this context to practise a more open, transparent and accountable CFSP; in particular insists on being fully involved and consulted annually 'ex-ante' on forthcoming actions and choices; reiterates its preparedness to review the CFSP nomenclature in order to adjust it to the political needs and the Union's role; asks the Court of Auditors to provide a special report on the cost-effectiveness of CFSP joint actions;\n",
        "19. Underlines that European citizens need freedom, justice and security in their everyday lives; stresses that the EU budget for 2007 should contribute to safeguarding these privileges for the European Union both externally and internally, including at economic and social level;\n",
        "20. Welcomes the fact that, in the context of external security, the Commission has included energy policy as one of the main priorities for 2007; recognises the fundamental importance of sustainability, competitiveness, andsecuringenergysupply as well as energy efficiencyofthe European economy and stressesthe importance of diversifying  gas and oil supply and of exploring all possible means of enhancing the European Union’s self-sufficiency in energy; stresses the high levels of energy import dependence in the EU; calls for a coherent European energy strategy that includes dialogue with major supply partner countries; calls on Member States to implement fully existing Community legislation on the liberalisation of energy markets, the improvement of energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy sources and research on the production and use of bio-fuels and alternative sources of energy;\n",
        "21.  Emphasises the importance of environmental issues relating to energy; stresses the importance of meeting the Kyoto target of an 8% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 in this context;\n",
        "22.  Welcomes the start of the new freedom, security and justice programmes for 2007‑2013 in the area of justice and home affairs; emphasises that, in the face of modern, globalised crime, concerted EU action is a necessary component of policies to ensure a safe society founded on the rule of law;\n",
        "23. Stresses that the objective of the integration of migrants and border management is of importance in the years to come; intends to provide sufficient means in 2007 to ensure the extension of the Schengen area;\n",
        "24. Recalls that communication is a key factor in helping European citizens understand the EU better; points out that scarce resources should be used to develop an efficient and coherent communication policy across the EU institutions; is convinced that the potential for synergies between the communication activities of the Commission and Parliament has still not been fully developed;\n",
        "26.  Underlines the importance of SMEs which contribute considerably to innovation, growth and prosperity in the EU;  underlines the importance of continued simplification of the regulatory regime in particular for SMEs;\n",
        "27.  Urges the Member States and the Commission to pay special attention to those areas that form the basis of a healthy modern economy, such as knowledge, skills, research and development, innovation, information society technologies and energy; recalls the importance of strengthening the capacities of the knowledge-triangle (education, research and innovation) and reinforcing the links among them; calls for all policies in Member States and at EU level to be geared to supporting research and innovation wherever possible; strongly supports the measures for the development and completion of the European information society as it promotes inclusion, better public services and quality of life;\n",
        "28.           Considers that, in the context of the new generation of programmes, financial instruments need to be rethought in a more fine-tuned way and endowed with adequate financial resources, which is vital for supporting an industrial policy geared towards EU-wide prosperity and competitiveness, including SMEs, which would successfully capitalise on research output through industrial applications (i.e. technology transfer from universities and research centres into industrial application);\n",
        "29. Stresses that, in the face of increasing global competition, the capability of employers and employees alike as well as of companies as a whole to adjust sufficiently to current changes will be decisive; believes that in this context the development of policies of and for the future is of vital importance and that the Globalisation Fund, as currently under discussion, might be a first step in the right direction; believes that the setting up of a new European Institute of Technology may undermine or overlap on existing structures and may therefore not be the most effective use of funds in this context; believes that the employment potential of innovative enterprises could help the EU to overcome certain difficulties posed by global competition; calls for elimination of the barriers to the mobility of researchers and for the creation of an open and competitive labour market for researchers;\n",
        "30. Recalls that bringing the EU closer to citizens is the main aim of the communication policy; considers that forms of information and dialogue for those who at the moment feel excluded from the European debate should be introduced, and that the dialogue and understanding between European citizens should be promoted through successful EU programmes, such as Erasmus and Leonardo (Life-Long Learning), and through language training;\n",
        "31. Recalls that strengthening economic and social cohesion is one of the fundamental objectives of the EU as laid down by the Treaty establishing the European Community; points out that 2007 will be the first year the new Member States will receive full support from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund; considers, therefore, that enhancing cohesion should remain a priority for 2007 and that sufficient financial resources should be allocated to Cohesion Policy during the 2007 budgetary procedure;\n",
        "32. Emphasises the importance of budgeting for real requirements in the field of payments under the Structural Funds; stresses the need for provision to be made for a level of payments sufficient to avoid jeopardising the realisation of programmes; considers that payments should correspond to the most reliable estimates, in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and good budgetary practice;\n",
        "33. Underlines that the December 2005 agreement of the European Council has clearly shown that the battle for resources has begun; highlights that Council figures would mean a decrease of resources available between 2007 - 2013 by over 15% as compared to what the Commission thought necessary in its original proposal; therefore believes it to be absolutely necessary in this situation to start looking at the quality of European Union expenditure;\n",
        "34. Shares the Council's assessment of the importance of good collaboration between the two arms of the budgetary authority and the Commission; agrees with the Council in particular that all appropriations need to be reviewed in detail for each policy sector and in this context reaffirms the importance of reallocation in order to allow the budgetary authority to make the necessary financial adaptations to meet present and future needs; supports the necessity of having high-quality activity statements and financial information on spending proposals in good time;\n",
        "35. Believes that the beginning of the new financial perspective offers a significant opportunity for reassessment; considers that if a programme is known not to be successful or is no longer a priority, it should be deleted; believes it important to keep an open mind with regard to introducing new programmes if they are needed for the EU to keep up with the pace of globalisation; stresses that the EU institutions must root out fraud and unnecessary bureaucracy wherever it is found;\n",
        "36. Proposes to ask for cost-benefit studies to be carried out on specific areas of the budget by using part of the resources allocated to the parliamentary committees in order to assess the regularity (compliance with the Financial Regulation, financial reporting system) and the performance (efficiency of resources, effectiveness of the projects, administrative cost) of the policies as implemented, and to draw the political conclusions of such evaluations;\n",
        "37.      Stresses that the Commission should take immediate action to simplify and improve effectiveness of administrative management with regard to the implementation of Community programmes for its own services, Member States and final beneficiaries, especially as regards small-scale projects; considers that a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the administrative management of Community legislation should be made on each of these four levels;\n",
        "38. Shares the Council's view that the financial framework setting up mid-term political priorities needs to be adjusted to a fast-developing world in order to allow the EU to maintain its political and economic position both at internal level, so as to meet the Lisbon objectives, and at external level, so as to meet the Millennium Goals, to achieve a successful Neighbourhood Policy and to take leadership in the globalisation process; furthermore stresses that at internal and external level, the Common Agricultural Policy should be adjusted to the future needs, and draws attention in this context to compulsory co-financing, increased market orientation, a level playing field and the abolition of export subsidies as favourable options;\n",
        "39. Considers that the 2007 budget, as the first budget of the next period, represents an opportunity to launch the new programmes within the scope of adjustments to new needs which might appear in the first part of the period;\n",
        "40. Believes that the review of all aspects of EU spending and resources planned for 2008 will offer a real opportunity to have a close look at the ways in which public money is spent; issues a reminder that Parliament should be involved in all potential changes in this field, in view of its rights and institutional prerogatives; underlines that only a comprehensive reassessment of revenue, notably the introduction of a system of real Own Resources, and expenditure, notably the introduction of co-financing of direct payments in agriculture and a shift in policy towards rural development, will enable the European Union \"to shake up the system\" in order to meet the challenges of our fast-changing world; looks forward to the report on reform of the system of Own Resources to make it more transparent, progressive and fair;\n",
        "41. Underlines that the 2007 budget procedure can offer a real opportunity for fine tuning as well as leverage for setting priorities; considers that the annual budget procedure could be used as a means for the Parliament to secure its priorities in ongoing legislative procedures and in particular in the conclusion of the multi-annual programmes in the context of a new multi-annual financial framework;\n",
        "42. Stresses that following the outcome of the negotiations on the next MFF, the Committee on Budgets should ensure that the new provisions contained in the IIA are implemented in the 2007 Budget;\n",
        "43. Reiterates that the proliferation of agencies, as seen over the past ten years, will undoubtedly have negative consequences for the funding of the operational programmes; considers a value-for-money approach towards the decentralised agencies as opposed to centralised activities an absolute necessity;\n",
        "44. Notes that the Commission plans to request 890 additional staff, of which 250 new posts are related to the next enlargement to Bulgaria and Romania, to deal with the extension of its tasks following enlargement; insists on the fact that this request should be well justified in the PDB, in particular for the posts allocated to new programmes;45.  Notes the Council request for administrative savings; is ready to cooperate with the Council on means to ensure the value for money of Community programmes, as highlighted in its Guidelines for the budget 2007;\n",
