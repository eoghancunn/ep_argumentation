{"speaker": "Neena Gill (PSE). –", "english": "Neena Gill (PSE). – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Elles for the Annual Policy Strategy report. I would like to highlight three areas. Speaking as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, firstly, I would like to say that I support the rapporteur in urging the Commission and Member States to focus on areas that are the bases of healthy and thriving modern economies: research and development, innovation, knowledge, skills, telecommunications and energy. Effective investment in those areas pays excellent dividends in the long run. The EU cannot be short-sighted and still compete globally and reverse the brain-drain leading to slower economic growth than might otherwise be the case.\nSecondly, I also back the rapporteur when he calls for Member States to implement existing and proposed legislation to help complete the single market. The Lisbon Strategy has not been sufficiently prioritised, despite the fact that it seeks improvement in areas where citizens want progress, like creating growth in jobs. As President Barroso told this House in his first address in July 2004, we must show our citizens that Europe can deliver what it promises.\nThirdly, speaking as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I have to say that I disagree with the emphasis the rapporteur has placed on our strategic partnership with the United States. I believe the EU must build solid and constructive relations with all global players to an equal extent, especially since a very disappointing cut in funding in Heading 4 has been proposed by the Commissioner in the PDB. That means that our traditional priorities and commitments are being reduced. As well as that, there will be no extra money for new agreements that we have entered into, including an increasingly important strategic partnership with India.\nSince resources are scarce, I ask the Commission to make sure that no money is wasted. So can the Commission guarantee that the appropriate measures and mechanisms are being put in place, as Mr Virrankoski highlighted, to ensure effective implementation and full take-up? We do not want to return millions of euros to the Member States at the end of the year.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill (PSE). – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Elles for the Annual Policy Strategy report.
