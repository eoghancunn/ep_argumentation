{"speaker": "David Martin (PSE),", "english": "David Martin (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . – Mr President, the global challenges facing the European Union have never been greater, yet we will have to face these challenges with limited resources. It is therefore vital, as the Commission rightly says, that these resources are clearly targeted at our priorities.\nThe Committee on International Trade fully supports the Commission’s efforts to improve policy coherence between the Community’s external and internal policies. In our opinion, all new policy initiatives regarding the internal market should be carefully assessed in the light of their external impact.\nThe International Trade Committee supports the rapporteur in calling for the Commission to target resources at the new global challenges we face, particularly the rise of India and China. It wishes to emphasise the contribution that a successful Doha Round could make to freeing up resources. Firstly, the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidy by 2013 would bring significant budgetary savings. Secondly, a successful round would lead to growth of the European Union economy as a whole and therefore help the EU budget grow.\nA key component in making a success of the Doha Round is to persuade the developing countries to sign up for Doha. In this respect, the EU has recognised that for them to get something out of Doha, they need to be linked into the world trading system. At the G8 Summit last July, President Barroso promised EUR 1 billion a year in trade-related assistance. If this is not delivered, the cynicism displayed by the developing countries at WTO talks will simply grow.\nThe International Trade Committee believes that this cannot just be a cosmetic re-labelling of existing aid. It has to be genuinely new money. We would like to suggest both to the rapporteur, in terms of the conclusions the committee draws from this report, and to the Commission, that the latter should report to us annually on how it is spending the EUR 1 billion that Mr Barroso promised on trade-related assistance, so that we can see that being delivered on a transparent basis.", "lang": "EN", "original": "David Martin (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . – Mr President, the global challenges facing the European Union have never been greater, yet we will have to face these challenges with limited resources.
