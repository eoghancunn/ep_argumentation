{"speaker": "Dalia Grybauskaitė,", "english": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission . Mr President, it is not only a case of knowledge but of respect. I wish to thank Mr Elles for a very good start to the process in which we are engaging in the first year of the new financial perspective, after the successful signature and vote today in Parliament. Today we are starting a process in which we will be engaged seriously in preparation for the first year of this financial perspective, a symbolically important year.\nIn the report on the APS, policy priorities have been set and we think that the core goals and priorities of the Commission’s five-year strategic objectives are reflected in the 2007 budget proposal. On prosperity, growth and employment, about 43% of our preliminary draft budget is to be devoted to the Lisbon Strategy through Headings 1a and 1b.\nThe Commission is also committed towards close cooperation with the EIB on new financial instruments to increase the leverage effect of the EU budget for Lisbon-related priorities, including trans-European networks and support to SMEs.\nOn solidarity, security and freedom, which are important priorities mentioned in the APS, we have already included EUR 291 million for solidarity and management of migration, including the External Borders Fund and the Fund for Integration of Third Country Nationals.\nThe Commission proposes a 17% increase for environmental policies, including the extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme to the new Member States.\nOn external relations, we agree that Europe, as a world partner, needs to support this area financially. The key action for 2007 is the start-up of new programmes, such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. We must also continue to strengthen relations with our partners in the developed world.\nOn EU governance and human and financial resources for 2007, I should like to point out that we have already requested 610 new posts in relation to the last enlargement, and 230 to prepare for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. The Commission proposes the redeployment of about 600 staff between its DGs to serve priorities other than enlargement-related needs.\nOn value for money, I am fully in favour of a wider, more macroeconomic approach towards the assessment of how European financial resources are used. I am satisfied that the new part III of the IIA on sound financial management is, and will be, effectively and fully implemented.\nI have proposed the introduction of an early warning system to ensure more accurate forecasts and close monitoring of budget implementation.\nWe will listen very carefully and take into account all your opinions expressed today and in the future. We are always ready to cooperate with you and the Council in an open-minded manner, and we hope to have a very good result: a favourable budget by the end of this year.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission .
