{"speaker": "Jürgen Schröder (PPE-DE),", "english": "Jürgen Schröder (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development . – Mr President, let me make some remarks from the point of view of development cooperation. In my view, the Commission is seeking to amalgamate various budget lines. If it succeeds, it will no longer be possible for this Parliament to take decisions on how much is allocated to important sectors such as combating HIV/AIDS. Parliament should not allow its powers to be curtailed in this way.\nSecondly, the Commission’s APS document does not refer at all to the Millennium Development Goals or sectors important for poverty reduction, particularly education and poverty diseases.\nWhat is more, I have to insist that the ‘simplification’ of the legislative context for external action for the period from 2007 to 2013 must not result in a loss of transparency in the use of development policy resources and that the breakdown between budget lines for geographical regions and thematic sectors for the 2007 budget must allow for at least the same level of visibility as the 2006 budget.\nIn addition, let me mention the importance of the Commission monitoring the Member States and their official development assistance levels, because of the problem of some Member States overstating ODA levels by taking into account funds that are not actually part of ODA. Linked to the ODA level is aid effectiveness and quality. The Commission must continue to implement the Paris Agenda on aid effectiveness and show the public that EU development aid makes a difference.\nFinally, I want to underline the need always to put the fight against poverty at the top of the EU agenda and, therefore, the need to strive for a substantial share of aid to go to the LDCs.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jürgen Schröder (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development . – Mr President, let me make some remarks from the point of view of development cooperation.
