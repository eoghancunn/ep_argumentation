{"speaker": "Sharon Bowles,", "english": "Sharon Bowles, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . − Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that, in the current turmoil, the interconnection between all institutions is plain to see. It is equally plain and logical that regulation has to be targeted at function and not at entities. It would be wrong if one private company had to abide by different rules from others just because it was owned by private equity.\nThere are two sides to everything. Amid the frequent criticism again this week of short selling, let us not forget the stock lenders. Attention by investors – even supervisors – to the lending policies of pension funds and others is relevant, and not just the activities of share borrowers. We have visited this matter before in the context of voting borrowed shares. ‘Two sides’ also means that enhancing transparency will only be effective if it is accompanied by due diligence, and not undone again by excessive disclaimers. Finally, voluntary codes do have a role, and reach parts which we cannot regulate. However, they are not just a private matter for the industries concerned, and need exposure, easy access and active review and monitoring.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Sharon Bowles, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . − Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that, in the current turmoil, the interconnection between all institutions is plain to see.
