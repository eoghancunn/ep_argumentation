Hence I am also saying this because the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Schulz, has tried repeatedly in plenary to drive a wedge between the groups on precisely these issues. Good/bad, left/right, state/market thinking does not equate with the reality of people’s lives today, but emanates from an old electoral rhetoric based on class war, which I had hoped had been conquered in the EU, and today’s debate has so far also thankfully shown this.\nReason has triumphed and a realistic step forward can therefore be taken, a response given to the financial turbulence and people’s questions answered. We have an enduring financial crisis. We therefore need action. We cannot ignore the agenda. We need more European Union, more transparency, more supervision, more European and global regulation. We need risk-based equity capital and we must ensure that we do what we admit to in these reports and that what we demand in both reports is implemented by all those involved.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Othmar Karas (PPE-DE). - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to say that both reports – the Rasmussen report and the Lehne report – as well as the social agenda with its 19 items that we debated last time, and the Council and Parliament resolutions on Georgia show what we are capable of when we are all pulling together, despite our different opinions.\nI am saying this, therefore, because I am glad that the socialist election campaign machine, the superficial populism and the mutual recriminations have been dispensed with and the business of democratic parliamentarianism, responsibility for taking the necessary action and a frank and realistic debate will hopefully win through tomorrow.
