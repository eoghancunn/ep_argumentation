{"speaker": "Vladimír Špidla,", "english": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Honourable Members, I would like to thank you for this debate, which has been very thorough and extremely interesting. I should like, if I may, briefly to go over some points that emerged in the debate, which I feel are particularly relevant and important.\nIt is quite clear that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are, according to the majority view in the debate, very much a unique issue. They are not ordinary services, as they guarantee rights and as they are geared towards people who are, or who may be, too weak or vulnerable to look after themselves and their rights. There was also clearly a strong emphasis on the subsidiarity principle, and on the fact that proposals for different solutions were coming in from all sides. It was also clear that there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the legal definition of these services, in particular concerning the principles governing the internal market.\nHonourable Members, I feel that all of these issues are important and that we must continue to pay attention to them. The Commission intends to take the following steps: to draw up a European strategy on SSGIs, which will be adopted in the autumn of this year. In this communication the further steps that the Commission intends to take will be put forward. The Commission is assessing legal feasibility and the right political opportunity to propose legal instruments in this area. The communication will be issued in conjunction with the two-year report on SSGIs. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the situation of SSGIs in Europe. It describes progress in modernising these services, emphasises the significance of the sector from a socio-economic perspective and describes the development of legal measures at this time.\nHonourable Members, I share your view that social services in the public interest are a fixed element in our social model, that they are set to develop very rapidly, that fresh challenges lie ahead and that debate is needed. Thank you.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission .
