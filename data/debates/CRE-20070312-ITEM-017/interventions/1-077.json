{"speaker": "Jean Lambert,", "english": "Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, I would like to pick up on a point that has been raised by one or two colleagues – that many of the users of social services are not, as it were, everyday consumers. They are people in particular social need and therefore, that is why we look at social services as having a different mission, and possibly a different organisation, to general consumption. It is one of the reasons why we took these services out of the Services Directive, because we did not consider that they operated to the same market rules as travel agencies, construction companies or anything else in the general services sector.\nIt is true that we talk about subsidiarity in connection with these services, and many of us were very happy that they stayed with the Member States who have the right to decide how they will organise them and what they will deliver. But those services are under pressure from at least two directions. Firstly, they are under pressure internationally through GATS, and that is why we have retabled an amendment which came from the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Secondly, they are under pressure from market pressures within the European Union, which gradually begin to erode and undermine the rights of Member States to decide exactly how they will organise and finance their services.\nThat is why many of us in this House think that not only do we need legal clarity, but we also need to look towards legal protection, because at the moment, all that Member States can operate with is the Treaty. At times, because they have chosen to operate their services in a particular way, they find unintended consequences through market pressures.\nAs regards this report, my group feels that the original built a very beautiful frame for social services, but we feel that at the moment all it contains is a sketch rather than certainty and a clear picture, or a clear view, from this Parliament. We have basically said that we want to continue consultation for a further three months and then Parliament will have to decide what it wants to do: whether it wants to maintain decisions that we have taken in earlier reports such as that by Mr Rapkay, or whether we are going to row back and deny a legal protection that many of us believe our social services need.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, I would like to pick up on a point that has been raised by one or two colleagues – that many of the users of social services are not, as it were, everyday consumers.
