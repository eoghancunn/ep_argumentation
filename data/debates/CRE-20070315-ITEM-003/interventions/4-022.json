The report deals with the singular difficulties that many islands face in competing successfully with their counterparts on the mainland.\nThe report usefully identifies categories of islands: some are large – 5 island regions have populations exceeding 500 000 and account for 75% of the European island population – whilst the remainder are much smaller.\nI am more familiar with the problems faced by smaller islands, such as those off the coast of my native Scotland. For example, only this week it has been reported that twice as many young women than men are leaving the Hebrides. If this continues, the population will not be sustainable from 2019.\nAs Mr Musotto’s report outlines, there are also common difficulties faced by islands, for example higher prices, difficult terrain, remoteness and poor infrastructure. I support the call for these problems to be recognised in regional policy.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, an island holiday may be the stuff of dreams in terms of getting away from it all, but living and working on islands can pose many difficulties, and we should acknowledge this in our policy-making.\nI congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, on his report, which outlines the natural and economic constraints faced by islands in the context of regional policy.
