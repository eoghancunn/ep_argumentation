{"speaker": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). –", "english": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Florenz’s report. I strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking.\nI was delighted when Scotland led the UK in introducing a smoking ban in March 2006, and I am pleased that bans are now in place in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAs a Scottish ban has now been in place for some time, we have evidence on what kind of health impact it has had. Recent figures from Scotland show that, since the smoking ban was introduced, there has been a 20% reduction in heart attack admissions to hospital.\nWe also continue to raise awareness of the health risks associated with smoking. For this reason, on 14 November 2007, I am launching a written declaration in the European Parliament calling for more research and resources for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a common and costly lung disease whose advanced stage is chronic respiratory failure. It is an under-recognised, under-diagnosed and under-treated disease, neglected by health care providers and the public. The rise of COPD makes it all the more important that the EU adopts comprehensive smoke-free policies and Mr Florenz’s report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Florenz’s report.
