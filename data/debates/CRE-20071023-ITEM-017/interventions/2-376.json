{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). –", "english": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). – Mr President, this motion for a resolution is balanced, precise and comprehensive, and the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, deserves our honest congratulations on his work.\nMy only criticism of this resolution is that it has come too late. The supporting scientific evidence and the undisputed need for the policy options contained in this document have been clear for all to see for many years. It is sadly certain that the delay in making significant progress towards achieving a Europe free from tobacco smoke will have brought about the deaths from a preventable cause of hundreds of thousands of EU citizens.\nWho is to be blamed for this massive sacrifice of human life? I will mention only two of the main guilty parties so as to shame them, even though not in a sufficiently drastic fashion.\nFirstly, the tobacco industry. It has spent millions of euros on campaigns of lies and misinformation. It has manipulated the media, politicians and even scientists in order to buy more time, and this it has done purely and simply for financial gain, knowing full well that thousands of lives were at stake.\nSecondly, the governments and some political parties of many EU Member States. They have bowed to the power and influence of the tobacco barons and have continued to hold back on taking effective measures to protect their citizens against the plague of smoking. Even straightforward measures, such as increasing tobacco taxation and making free treatment of tobacco addicts widely available, have been suppressed.\nI support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and I urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco-related diseases of so many lives.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). – Mr President, this motion for a resolution is balanced, precise and comprehensive, and the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, deserves our honest congratulations on his work.\nMy only criticism of this resolution is that it has come too late.
