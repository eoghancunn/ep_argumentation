{"speaker": "Romana Jordan Cizelj,", "english": "Romana Jordan Cizelj, on behalf of the PPE-DE group . – ( SL ) Rooting out poverty within the millennium development framework is a huge and demanding task. It includes not only tasks from the social sphere, but also a wider spectrum of topics that enable the human race to develop sustainably. Efficient utilisation of the 10th European Development Fund can substantially contribute to realisation of this objective.\nI agree with the rapporteur that education and healthcare are two of the basic areas involved in improving the quality of life of the poorest populations. We must adequately increase the share of funds assigned to these two areas in the European Union’s development assistance, including also the 10th European Development Fund.\nHowever, at a time of global challenges such as climate change, this is not enough. Nowadays, in parallel with economic growth and growth in GDP, greenhouse gas emissions are also growing. It is because of this, despite economic progress in other areas, that in some areas the wellbeing of the population is in decline. When we are designing all our development policies, we must define wellbeing within the framework of sustainable development. That is why it is important for the 10th European Development Fund to reflect the balance between the economic, social and environmental components.\nAnother area that I should like to mention is gender equality. Women in society have various roles, from concerns and responsibilities for the family’s basic subsistence to passing on of knowledge and life patterns to their children. Frequently, however, women have no privileges, no possibility of becoming independent and making their own decisions, and do not have equal access to services. That is why I believe that ensuring equal opportunities is one of the fundamental horizontal – I repeat, horizontal – building blocks of any development policy.\nFinally, I should like to say that a policy can be successful only if it obtains suitable support from the population, which is reflected through democratic and honest elections. In future, parliaments should play a much more important role in drawing up, controlling and implementing development policies – not just the European Parliament, but also Member State parliaments.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Romana Jordan Cizelj, on behalf of the PPE-DE group . – ( SL ) Rooting out poverty within the millennium development framework is a huge and demanding task.
