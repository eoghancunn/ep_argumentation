{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I am happy to be here for the debate on Mr Bono’s report and I should like to thank him for his contribution and the committee for its work. I am sure, as he said, that culture is important to our lives and it is more and more central to the future of the European Union.\nI would like to add that it defines our Community much more than business or geography. We also need to understand that culture makes a contribution; culture creates; culture is something positive, not consuming our budgets or conflicting with our needs but bringing a lot of enrichment, including jobs and growth. This was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year’s summit conclusions, in the study we presented some time ago, and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation.\nI would like to underline just three specific ideas or items from your report, because there are many and I will not comment on all of them.\nFirst, you ask us to establish a European vision of culture, creativity and innovation. The European agenda we have now agreed does exactly that. We are strengthening the cooperation between Member States, including the promotion of creative industries. This is one of three pillars. Part of that work will need to look at how to measure more accurately the contribution these industries make to the economy and how best to support them.\nSecond, you ask us to look at the external dimension. This is one of the three priorities of the agenda and we are very active now in encouraging our partners, our Member States, to ratify the UNESCO Convention – because not all Member States and also other countries in the world have done so – and also in ensuring its implementation. And we are increasingly including cultural elements both in our development cooperation and in our bilateral relations with emerging economies.\nThird, I agree with you that full attention has to be paid to implementing Article 151 fully in EU policies. I have established really good contacts and cooperation with my colleagues, including Commissioner McCreevy on the internal market, on the various aspects of copyright protection. I am confident that, with the help of all of you, we will achieve the objectives laid down in this Treaty article.\nYou also mention the mobility of artists and cultural workers, which is very high on our agenda, especially this year. Member States have already constituted a working group on this topic and the Commission is implementing the pilot action on the mobility of artists proposed by this Parliament last year.\nThe Commission will support all these efforts, in particular with a study to better understand the links between culture, creativity and innovation, as well as another study on how to have an environment conducive to the development of creative and cultural industries, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises and risk-taking.\nThe results of these initiatives will feed into a Green Paper on cultural and creative industries, which the Commission plans to publish in 2009.\nI am looking forward to the debate.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I am happy to be here for the debate on Mr Bono’s report and I should like to thank him for his contribution and the committee for its work.
