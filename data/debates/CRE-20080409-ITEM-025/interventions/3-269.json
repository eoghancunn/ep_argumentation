Culture is now referred to in terms of means towards economic growth, and many studies now emphasise the economic impact of cultural activities. In this context, I recall the study The Economy of Culture in Europe made in 2006 by a private consultant, KEA European Affairs, that presents some impressive numbers for the cultural sector; however, these numbers are debatable since MP3 players, mobile phones and publicity are also considered by this study as ‘culture’.\nTherefore, we feel that focusing on such economic aspects may lead to confusion, and important things such as creativity or artistic potential may be put in second place if they do not turn out to be sufficiently profitable.\nI am in favour of a cultural policy that supports cultural diversity, artistic creativity and the development of the artistic potential of individuals and communities: these are all guidelines that I think we should keep in mind for future action.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Nicodim Bulzesc (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I appreciate this report, but I would like to make some remarks.\nThe topic of the cultural industries is closely connected to the topic of the economic value of culture.
