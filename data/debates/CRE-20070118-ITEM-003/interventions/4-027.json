I wish to congratulate you, as we now have some women in the main body of the European Parliament.\nI welcome this report on gender mainstreaming in the committees. Is it unique? It is unique of its kind. I should like to thank the rapporteur in particular for her excellent work.\nIt is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament uses its influential position in the Community to support and promote gender equality through healthy self-examination of its own methods of working. The right to non-discrimination is protected by several European treaties, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Nevertheless, we need to continue developing the legal instruments in order to protect everyone – man or woman – from discrimination based on gender.\nComing from a country, Finland, with a long history of working for equal opportunities for men and women, I was very pleased with the findings of the report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. It showed that most of the committees, at least, attach some importance to gender mainstreaming.\nHowever, I would underline that we still have a long way to go. I support the ideas put forward by Ms Járóka, for example that all committees should have female members.\nEven though the number of women in the European Parliament continues to increase, inequality continues to exist when it comes to the really important positions in the political bodies, such as committee chairs, etc. I therefore urge each and every committee to put gender mainstreaming into practice in its own work, since this is one way of enabling women to take part fully in the decision-making processes of the EU.\nFinally, I should like to emphasise the need for specific data broken down by gender. After all, that is the only way really to evaluate how we are doing and what still needs to be done. Such gender-based statistics are very important for our future work.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I am very proud that we now have the first female first-Vice-President.
