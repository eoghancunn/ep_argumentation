{"speaker": "Charlie McCreevy,", "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, let me start my remarks with the situation on financial markets. We are in the most serious crisis in living memory. What started as a sub-prime crisis has now moved way beyond this to embrace the whole economy. Fears about the ability to raise financing are creating even greater lack of confidence among all economic actors. Unless there is a rapid unfreezing of lending, we face a continued downward spiral with obvious impact on economic activity. Freeing up lending is the number one priority today. The measures taken by central banks today will be an important contribution to unblocking the flow of lending.\nOne thing we have seen over the past few weeks is that no economy or financial market is immune from what is taking place.\nAt ECOFIN yesterday the concern of Finance Ministers was evident. We recognised the need for governments to intervene to shore up the financial markets, whether it be by capital injections, guarantees or other means. There is no silver bullet here. Strong, fast responses are essential.\nFor its part, the Commission is showing its capacity to respond quickly. I will be bringing to the college next week amendments to the deposit guarantee scheme which will increase the minimum level of protection, as well as requiring Member States to put in place procedures for rapid pay-out.\nAt Ecofin yesterday it was agreed that Member States would increase the current level to at least EUR 50 000, with many going beyond this to EUR 100 000. This reflects to a degree the differences in average savings in Member States.\nIn addition, we are urgently putting into place changes to our accounting rules to ensure banks in the EU can avail themselves of the same flexibility that is offered to banks in the United States, namely the option for individual banks, if they wish, to move assets from their trading books to their banking books. This is a comitology measure to which I hope Parliament will be able to give its agreement as a matter of urgency. In the mean time, I would hope that national supervisors would apply these new provisions already so that banks who wish to could avail themselves of this new possibility for their third-quarter results. In addition there is the IASB’s acceptance of the US SEC’s clarification of the use of fair-value accounting when there is no active market information. This is also highly relevant for banks and should be used for third-quarter reporting.\nWe are, of course, continuing to work for the rapid implementation of the Ecofin road map to strengthen the European Union’s capacity to prevent and manage future financial crises. Overall the implementation of these initiatives is on track.\nIn times of crisis, politicians need to be seen to do things so as to reassure the public. Things are no different here in Brussels, except that our margin for manoeuvre is more limited. We do not have access to the financial resources that are necessary to combat this crisis. It is central banks and finance ministers who control the purse strings. What we have do is endeavour to maximise a common approach by Member States. There can be no doubt that, by working together, Member States are in a much stronger position to counteract the downward spiral we are currently in. We must continue to assist Member States to work towards common goals and shared approaches. Where we have the tools, we will continue to move forward quickly with any necessary measure.\nTurning now to your report on the ‘Lamfalussy follow-up and future structure of supervision’, I would like to congratulate the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee – in particular Mrs van den Burg and Mr Dăianu – for their excellent work in producing such a thought-provoking and wide-ranging report. It highlights many of the challenges facing us now in the context of the current financial crisis. Innovative and well-thought-through proposals for regulatory and supervisory reform are crucially needed in the current situation.\nYou include in your report quite a demanding list of recommendations of where legislative action will be needed. It is heartening to see that so many of the issues you highlight are those that the Commission is also prioritising. In many cases, work is either ongoing or is planned on initiatives corresponding to the recommendations.\nLet me mention here some of our most important ongoing initiatives, such as the Solvency II proposal, the proposals for revisions to the Capital Requirements Directive, which was adopted by the college of Commissioners last week, and the legislative proposal on credit-rating agencies, due shortly.\nThis reflects many of the recommendations put forward in your report.\nThe proposal for amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive covers critical areas and will fundamentally strengthen the regulatory framework for EU banks and the financial system. I hope you will fully support us on this. Reaching agreement by next April is essential.\nSoon we will also go forward with a proposal on credit-rating agencies. The proposal will aim to introduce a legally binding authorisation and robust external oversight regime, whereby European regulators will have to supervise the policies and procedures followed by the credit-rating agencies. The Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) will play a strong coordination role.\nOn the EU supervisory framework, we are working on a revision of the Commission’s decisions establishing the three committees of supervisors. By the end of the year, these committees will be assigned specific, practical tasks, such as (i) mediation, (ii) drafting recommendations and guidelines, and (iii) an explicit role to strengthen the analysis and responsiveness to risks to the stability of the EU financial system.\nAlso, we have now to think about the longer-term vision of European supervision. Current events are showing its limitations today. The European Central Bank’s handling of the crisis has been exemplary. We now have to reflect seriously on how our supervisory arrangements for the cross-border financial institutions are constructed. As President Barroso announced earlier, we want to establish a high-level group to work through the various options and make recommendations on how we should proceed.\nThis takes up the suggestion in your report of a high-level group to tackle European supervisory arrangements.\nI have been around here long enough to know that agreement on reforms to supervisory arrangements will not be easy.\nBut if we do not draw the lessons from the current crisis, then we are doing a great disservice to the European Union. This reflection should not blind us to the necessity to take the pragmatic steps to strengthen supervision that we have put forward in the Solvency II proposal and in the Capital Requirements Directive. Colleges of supervisors are essential.\nThe time ahead will be fraught. All of us have to take our respective responsibilities. Now is the time for us to show that, by working together, we can confront the challenges. I look forward to the strong support of Parliament in this regard.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, let me start my remarks with the situation on financial markets.
