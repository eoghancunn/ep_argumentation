{"speaker": "Glenys Kinnock (PSE). –", "english": "Glenys Kinnock (PSE). – Madam President, I welcome the commitment shown by the Commissioner to these issues and indeed for giving us the clear understanding that it goes beyond just enjoying Oxfam chocolates.\nI would also like to say that, like Linda McAvan, I have many experiences from developing countries, such as Uganda, where last year I met a farmer who had a kilo of coffee beans to sell for 150 Ugandan shillings. Subsequently I paid 1000 Ugandan shillings for one cup of coffee. This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with.\nMy own country, Wales, has now voted to become a beacon of Fair Trade practice. This week our First Minister announced proposals for Wales to become a Fair Trade nation. We are now working to increase awareness of Fair Trade issues amongst the population in Wales. That means working in colleges, schools, the voluntary sector, across business networks and elsewhere, and increasing awareness amongst our population.\nI believe that in 2007 Wales will become a Fair Trade nation and our Fair Trade support will, as others have said, make an enormous difference to the lives of countless poor people and will mean that we will make our contribution to making poverty history.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Glenys Kinnock (PSE). – Madam President, I welcome the commitment shown by the Commissioner to these issues and indeed for giving us the clear understanding that it goes beyond just enjoying Oxfam chocolates.\nI would also like to say that, like Linda McAvan, I have many experiences from developing countries, such as Uganda, where last year I met a farmer who had a kilo of coffee beans to sell for 150 Ugandan shillings.
