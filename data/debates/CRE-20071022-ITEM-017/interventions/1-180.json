In Scotland, we know that better than most. As Ms Harms has said, my Group has a number of difficulties with the pro-nuclear aspects of this report. But my own view is that we must also make sure that we do research into other, non-nuclear sources of power and research into ways to make them better.\nIn paragraph 47, carbon-capture is experimental but it is promising, and in paragraph 47 we call on the Commission to lay down, as soon as possible, clear political guidelines for the promotion of research into carbon capture and storage. Commissioner, I am delighted to hear you are going to do that. It is important because, left to their own devices, the Member States will not come up with it.\nIn Scotland, we had at Peterhead a world-leading proposal for a demonstrator site. Because of political uncertainty entirely caused by the London Government not making it a priority, the project is going ahead – and it is going ahead in California.\nEurope can have a lead in this; we can be globally significant in the research potential that we have, but we must have real action. I am glad to hear that this report has some ideas which the Commission is taking forward.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE). – Mr President, Commissioner, it is good to see you burning the midnight oil along with us.\nIn Europe, we have a vast renewable energy potential.
