Of course it makes the ritual genuflection to climate change hysteria, despite the increasing doubts over the supposed link between CO 2 and climate. However, it also recognises the importance of diversifying energy supplies and of using fossil fuels, including coal, in the energy mix. It emphasises the need for energy security, and in this context rightly points to the need for energy efficiency, for continuing use of domestic resources, including coal, and for nuclear energy – both the current use of fission and the vital research on fusion, which is the great hope for the future.\nThe most remarkable factor in the energy debate is the way that the Greens and their fellow travellers agonise over carbon emissions but oppose the only mainstream low-carbon-generation technology. With oil at USD 90 a barrel, it is time for Ms Harms to recognise that nuclear power is the cheapest, safest, cleanest, most sustainable and most predictable base-load-generating technology available.
