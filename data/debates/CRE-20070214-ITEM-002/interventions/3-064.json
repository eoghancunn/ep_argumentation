All 785 of us have a responsibility to demonstrate that our Treaty commitments to human rights are not just rhetoric.\nWe have established that some Member States’ authorities, unfortunately including Ireland, are colluding in a breach of human rights. If we do not loudly shout ‘stop’, our people will believe they are on their own and that would be disastrous for the cohesion and indeed the future of our democracies.\nWe are not talking about history, nor do we lack evidence. We have it straight from President Bush that he will continue with extraordinary renditions and with secret detention centres. Member States, the Commission and the Council have an obligation to take on board our one hundred or more recommendations on getting to the full truth, preventing abuse of human rights and torture and ensuring our intelligence services are accountable to our parliaments. To be successful in countering terrorism, we have to defend our democratic and our humanitarian values, not abandon them as too costly or inconvenient. Otherwise we concede victory to those who want to destroy those self same values.\nFinally, I want to urge Members in particular to reject amendment 38 from the UEN Group, which seeks to create the fiction that the problem is an outdated Chicago Convention. The problem is a failure by Member States to actually implement the Chicago Convention.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). – Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Fava for an excellent report and his diligent concern to be fair and balanced.
