{"speaker": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). –", "english": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). – Mr President, some people are arguing that we should all support this report because otherwise we are not standing up for human rights. I have to say that I completely and totally disagree with that. I oppose flights of extraordinary rendition anywhere, but I cannot support this report because I believe many of its conclusions are politically motivated.\nLet us be clear. We are talking about conclusions and not findings. This is not an evidence-based report. For example, reference to 147 suspected flights into Ireland or 300 flights into Germany is totally unsubstantiated. If these conclusions were presented before any court as factual evidence, they would be thrown out of court because they would be found to be both inaccurate and speculative.\nThe European Parliament should remember that many of the things in this report are conclusions and not findings. For a report to conclude that all CIA flights should be banned in Ireland and not be banned in any of the other 26 Member States, lacks perspective and is another clear example of how politically motivated this report has become. This report does not look forward. It even fails to call for a review of the 60-year-old Chicago International Convention. However, I do have an amendment on that.\nSome people are saying we should come back in six months’ time with proposals. If we have proposals they should be in the report today. I believe that this report is full of conclusions and not findings, and very unfortunately I will be voting against it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). – Mr President, some people are arguing that we should all support this report because otherwise we are not standing up for human rights.
