Inevitably, some mistakes and excesses may have occurred, but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to illegally torture abductees in third countries, or any proof of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland. Where there is evidence of wrongdoing, such as in Italy, the national criminal justice systems have kicked in and started prosecutions. Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact, but are not necessarily illegal in international law where torture is not involved, and diplomatic assurances to the Member States do offer safeguards in extradition cases to third countries.\nThe report also seeks to extend the powers of the European Parliament into areas like security and counter-terrorism, which are more properly the remit of national parliaments and governments. I particularly dislike the request that the British Government extend consular protection to former UK residents who had not bothered to become citizens, but chosen instead to travel to dangerous parts of the world.
