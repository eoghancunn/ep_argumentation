{"speaker": "Ignasi Guardans Cambó,", "english": "Ignasi Guardans Cambó, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, Europe’s credibility is at stake here today. When we support this splendid report, which closes a year of hard and serious work in the committee, we will be showing a very strong concern, as great as anyone else’s, for security, and for security by all legal means, including the work of secret services, who can operate inside the law. We will be showing a concern for the legitimacy to protect our freedom and to protect the relationship with our closest allies. But we cannot support the idea that the only way to protect our freedom is through a dirty war. We do not like dirty war. That would represent – it has represented – a frontal attack on our values: what we stand for and what we preach.\nWe have gathered together here a great amount of information that proves the existence of an illegal, sometimes criminal, scheme designed to fight terrorism, operating worldwide and assisted by the passivity, if not the active cooperation, of some European Member States, of some governments or of people under their control. The Council itself cannot be excluded from criticism of such passivity. We have not acted as a court. We are a political body and what we will vote on here is a political statement based on facts: facts that have been checked, facts that have been proved and facts that anyone who reads this document will see to be true, not with the sort of truth that can be proved point by point before a court, because we did not have the means to do that. Why not? Because many of the governments involved did not help us to have those means. But the facts are there.\nThis is not inventive imagination. We have met the victims – those who could come, that is, for others are still in jail. Some are innocents in Guantánamo who were taken from their homes after being cleared by a court. So we are making a political statement and sending a message to European governments and to the Member States. We are saying to them here, on behalf of millions of European citizens: you cannot do this in our name. You cannot fight terrorism through a dirty war in our name. Do not do that in our name because you are not representing us when you fight terrorism through these means. That is the statement that this Chamber will be voting on here today. You are free to support it or not, but that is what is going to be voted on here in several hours’ time.\n(Applause from the ALDE Group)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ignasi Guardans Cambó, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, Europe’s credibility is at stake here today.
