{"speaker": "Adrian Severin (PSE). –", "english": "Adrian Severin (PSE). – Mr President, the main merit of the Fava report is that it puts in a clear light our values and our weaknesses. Its main message is that we should never seek more security at the expense of human rights. Moreover, there is no contradiction between defending security and defending human rights. We could, indeed, consolidate our security only if we respect our basic values. The terrorists want to undermine our values and make us abandon our way of life. We can defeat them precisely by defending our values and by refusing to abandon them.\nIt was not possible to prove beyond any doubt that certain violations of human rights took place in specific countries and with the cooperation of specific governments or of specific officials. However, it is beyond any doubt that unacceptable acts could have happened without being noticed by the national institutions concerned, without shaking the public conscience or without being resisted by the European Union Member States, since they apparently lack the capacity to oppose. Thus the report led us to the conclusion that we need better cooperation in the field of intelligence, as well as in the field of direct action against terrorists, in order to increase our strength in coping with security challenges, without decreasing our capacity to respect and promote human rights.\nWe need a better joint educational effort in order to raise the general respect for human rights and to encourage political leaders to look for a better equilibrium between values and Realpolitik . We need more political solidarity among the Member States in order to make them less vulnerable to the pressures of those political players who believe in the power of force. We need a common foreign and security policy that will allow us, at the same time, to deter the terrorists and promote our values in the world. We need a transnational democracy that is able to strike a balance between effective security services and popular oversight of their activities. To sum up, we need more Europe.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Adrian Severin (PSE). – Mr President, the main merit of the Fava report is that it puts in a clear light our values and our weaknesses.
