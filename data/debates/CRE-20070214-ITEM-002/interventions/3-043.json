{"speaker": "Stavros Lambrinidis (PSE). –", "english": "Stavros Lambrinidis (PSE). – Mr President, remarkably, the only governments that have to date officially admitted knowledge of participation in the secret CIA renditions and flights are those of the United States and of Bosnia and Herzegovina – that is it! One therefore has to wonder whether the European Council and Member States will continue to stick their heads in the sand in the event that President Bush makes good on his statement to keep utilising the same illegal operations whenever or wherever he sees fit.\nTo avoid the future occurrence of these or similar illegal activities, practical steps must now be taken. The Council should officially condemn these activities and enquire into Member States’ and its own knowledge and participation. The Commission should examine all agreements and arrangements with third country military and secret services to ensure that they respect human rights and fundamental rights. Member States should establish official inquiries on the CIA flights that landed on their territories, set the actions of secret services under the democratic control of the governments and instruct their airport authorities to check all suspicious private flights.\nFinally, the European Parliament should submit its report to the next European Council meeting and ask that a discussion of its conclusions and recommendations be placed on the Council’s agenda.\nNo one in this Chamber should be anti-American or pro-American, a defender or a detractor of any specific European country or government. We are all pro-European; we are Members of the European Parliament and, as such, we have an obligation to uphold European values and laws against whoever violates them – friend, foe or even ourselves. With this report, Parliament has fulfilled its duty to Europe’s citizens. It is now incumbent upon the Council and the Member States to do the same.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stavros Lambrinidis (PSE). – Mr President, remarkably, the only governments that have to date officially admitted knowledge of participation in the secret CIA renditions and flights are those of the United States and of Bosnia and Herzegovina – that is it!
