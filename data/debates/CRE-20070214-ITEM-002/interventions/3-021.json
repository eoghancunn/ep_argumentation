{"speaker": "Sarah Ludford (ALDE). –", "english": "Sarah Ludford (ALDE). – Mr President, touching as it is to hear Conservative Mr Helmer defend the Labour Government, those who collaborate in refusing to face the facts on the grounds that an inquiry is anti-American will have red faces when the heavy guns in Congress turn their energies to this topic.\nEuropean Commission President Barroso, who of course comes from the PPE-DE Group, the centre-right, wants the themes of accountability and promoting Europe’s values in the world to figure alongside security in the Berlin Declaration marking the EU’s 50th birthday in March.\nThis serious and professional report, for which I thank Mr Fava, the committee chairman Mr Coelho and all the staff, is about accountability for human rights abuses which European governments did collude in or allowed to happen on their territory. It is about security, but built within a framework of law in which the security not to end up as a tortured ghost detainee counts too and it is certainly about promoting Europe’s values in the world, the ones of democracy, human rights and the rule of law to which Member States signed up in the Treaty.\nI agree with US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates, speaking at the recent Munich Security Conference about the West’s defeat of totalitarianism in the 20th century and our opposition to extremist ideologies now. He said: ‘Our most effective weapon, then and now, has been Europe’s and North America’s shared belief in political and economic freedom, religious toleration, human rights, representative government and the rule of law. Those values kept our side united’. Indeed, so why has the Bush Administration – not Americans as a whole – tossed away the moral high ground and dragged America’s reputation into the mud by a programme of kidnapping, forced disappearance, dark prisons, indefinite detention, cruel and inhuman treatment and outsourcing of torture?

Even in Poland, fewer than four out of ten have a mainly positive view of the US.\nEurope has failed a test in the last five years, a test of whether it will practise its values or only preach them.
