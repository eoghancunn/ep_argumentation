    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Points to the historical task, in 'creating an ever closer Union' (Article 1 of the EU Treaty), of creating instruments for freedom alongside the development of instruments for security and justice and for economic and social progress;\n",
        "2. Stresses the need to overcome the crisis in the constitution process, to preserve the central achievements of the constitution, and to establish the Charter of Fundamental Rights as legally binding;\n",
        "3. Welcomes the Commission's proposals on the consolidation and improved transparency of the procedure on compliance with fundamental rights in its legislative proposals and considers this to be the first positive result of the ambitious measures on the protection of fundamental rights announced in Parliament by Commission President José Manuel Barroso on 17 November 2004, and the working parties set up by him to this end;\n",
        "4. Calls on the Commission to make the monitoring process more transparent and to consult with relevant actors in civil society, particularly those potentially affected by the Commission proposal;\n",
        "5. Stresses that the Commission's proposed 'systematic' monitoring makes it absolutely necessary for every legislative proposal to be thoroughly checked and for the result to be substantiated;\n",
        "6.  Calls on the Commission to check the compliance of legislative proposals not only with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also with all European and international instruments regarding fundamental rights and with the rights derived from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of European law;\n",
        "7.  Stresses that genuinely systematic and rigorous protection of fundamental rights calls not just for scrutiny to identify any legal errors in weighing up the respective importance of the freedom of the individual and the requirements of the public interest but, in addition, for political analysis on every occasion to ascertain which of the various solutions that weigh up these interests correctly produces the best balance between determination of the objective and restriction of fundamental rights (optimisation in terms of fundamental rights);\n",
        "8.  Considers it desirable that scrutiny should concentrate on the fundamental rights specifically affected in each case, and considers it essential to state these on each occasion explicitly and individually in recitals;\n",
        "9.  Hopes that specific, practical ways can be found of applying the stated methods by means of which the Commission intends to implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its legislative proposals;\n",
        "10. Points out that systematic internal monitoring to ensure that fundamental rights are upheld when legislative proposals are being drawn up must be the subject of an explanatory report which provides legal grounds for upholding such rights;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission to think over its decision to divide its considerations on fundamental rights into the current three categories in its impact assessment - economic, social and environmental effects - and to create a specific category entitled 'Effects on fundamental rights', to ensure that all aspects of fundamental rights are considered;\n",
        "12. Underlines the Commission's right, throughout the legislative procedure, to withdraw its proposal before it is approved by the Council, if there are changes which violate a fundamental right;\n",
        "13. Rejects the Commission's reservations on bringing annulment proceedings 'on the basis of case-by-case political scrutiny' and strongly emphasises the absolute priority of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms over all political considerations;\n",
        "14. Considers it necessary to extend the procedure on compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the entire legislative procedure and into the comitology system, to strengthen the position of Parliament, to make the role of the prospective Fundamental Rights Agency more precise and to call more frequently on its support;\n",
        "15. Intends to this end to amend Rule 34 of its Rules of Procedure, so as to entrust the Committee on Civil Liberties with the task of monitoring the consequences of legislative proposals, measures and regulations relevant to fundamental rights, and also to amend Rules 91 and 115 of its Rules of Procedure so that Parliament's resolutions can also apply to Member State affairs, enabling it to fulfil its responsibility pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty at an early stage;\n",
        "16. Points out that, even though general consultation procedures exist, independent external bodies and organisations which are specifically concerned with fundamental-rights issues must be more extensively involved; to that end, calls upon the Commission to devise a specific arrangement for enabling those bodies and organisations to be consulted during the procedure for drafting legislative proposals which have an impact on fundamental rights;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Council to strengthen the systematic monitoring of fundamental rights also in areas covered by intergovernmental cooperation, to publish the results and likewise to secure the support of the Fundamental Rights Agency;\n",
        "18. Reaffirms that  Parliament and other European Union institutions, may benefit, within the framework of the legislative procedure, as appropriate and on a voluntary basis, from the expertise on fundamental rights acquired by the Fundamental Rights Agency, as well as in the areas of police and judicial cooperation;\n",
        "19. Recalls that, as agreed with Commission Vice-President Frattini and the Finnish Presidency during the trialogue held in Strasbourg on 15 November 2006, neither the Treaties nor the proposal for a regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights preclude the possibility of Parliament seeking the assistance of the  Fundamental Rights Agency when implementing Article 7 of the EU Treaty; expects that the Commission and the future Fundamental Rights Agency will provide in the multi-annual framework, as well as in the annual work programme, for the necessary financial and human resources, so that the Fundamental Rights Agency can respond adequately to requests from Parliament when exercising its powers according to Article 7 of the EU Treaty;\n",
        "20. Stresses the importance of establishing suitable means of communicating with and informing the general public and the EU institutions concerning the internal monitoring of the upholding of fundamental rights, including by drawing up periodic reports on the subject;\n",
        "21. Requests Member State parliaments, in particular in the fields of police and judicial cooperation and the common foreign and security policy, to verify the compatibility of all decisions and measures with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that the indivisibility of fundamental rights is preserved and the systematic and thorough monitoring of fundamental rights in all the Union's policies can be guaranteed;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Council and the Commission, pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Treaty and Articles 200 and 212 of the EC Treaty, to submit a yearly report on the fundamental rights policy of the Union to Parliament and the national parliaments, and to engage in a systematic, open and permanent dialogue on the safeguarding of fundamental rights in the Union;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission and the Council to report to Parliament on the follow-up given to the reports by the network of national experts;\n",
        "24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States and of the acceding and candidate countries.\n"
