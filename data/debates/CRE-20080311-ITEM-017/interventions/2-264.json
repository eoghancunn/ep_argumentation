I would like to draw attention, in particular, to three measures which were our successful amendments, which are to be particularly welcomed.\nIn paragraph 21 of the report, we recognise that decoupling direct payments has largely been successful, and we are firmly of the view that should be rolled out. Yes, it has to be done properly and sensitively, but it should be pushed forward.\nIn paragraphs 37 and 38 we explicitly recognise that set-aside is an anachronism and should be fully swept away, and where there are spin-off environmental benefits, they be properly dealt with under Pillar 2.\nIn paragraphs 86 to 91 we recognise the importance of niche products for Europe’s agriculture internationally.
