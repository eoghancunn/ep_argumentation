{"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I am glad to see such a big audience here for this debate, because it is an important one. If we were to go on the clapometer in relation to large payments to royalty or individual farmers, they would be quaking in their boots in royal houses across Europe. But it is a more complex debate, as we have heard from our eastern European colleagues.\nAs regards the health check, can I say very briefly that in relation to decoupling and modulation in Ireland, we have fully decoupled, and I think the Commissioner acknowledges that. We want to stick with our historic payments system and we do not like increased modulation. It is robbing Peter to pay Paul, dressed up as something else. We do not really know where the rural development money will end up and we need to look at that very carefully.\nIt is not Article 69 that troubles Irish farmers at the moment, but the WTO. I have in front of me here, and will share with colleagues, the assessment of the latest paper from the WTO. It is in full colour and it is not pretty. If Mr Mandelson has his way, then I am afraid that the beef and dairy, lamb and pigmeat sectors in Europe will be wiped out, and so will the common agricultural policy. The cuts in tariffs range up to 70%.\nNow, perhaps people do not understand the impact of that, but it means that our producers will not and cannot compete with imported food products and products that are produced to very, very different standards.\nThe lamb sector, which Parliament is actually trying to help, will be decimated by the WTO. Can I ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps take this analysis that the Irish Farmers’ Association has completed – and I will raise it again, because it is in full colour – and come back to me and tell me, I hope, that they have got it wrong, although I fear that they have got it right.\nThere is a complete lack of information for this House on the impact of the latest text from the WTO, and I think we need and deserve to have that information. I would just like to say that Irish farmers support the European Union, but over the weekend I had many come to my door who are questioning their decisions in relation to voting on various treaties.
