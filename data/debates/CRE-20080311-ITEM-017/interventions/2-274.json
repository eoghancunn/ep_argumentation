Does it find it healthy for the CAP to fund farmers not to grow food? Does it find it healthy to turn farmland over to biofuels, just when there is a world shortage of cereals? Does it find the CAP healthy when genuine farmers – in the UK at least – are struggling to make a living? Does it know that farmers in New Zealand are not now subsidised but are doing very well and that only 3% of them went under when subsidies were withdrawn?\nSince it sounds to me that the CAP is very unhealthy, is it not time to turn off the life-support machine and let European farmers make their own way?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Derek Roland Clark (IND/DEM). – Mr President, any health check needs measurement and assessment.
