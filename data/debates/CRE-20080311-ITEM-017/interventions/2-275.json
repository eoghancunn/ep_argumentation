There are four quick points I would like to make.\nFirstly, the theory of decoupling is very good but its practice has been disappointing for some in failing to command the higher market returns for producers that were promised.\nSecondly, we must sustain sufficient instruments to safeguard against market and supply crises.

Food security is impossible without guaranteed economic sustainability for producers.\nThirdly, we can do more on CAP simplification to reduce the bureaucratic burden and, yes, to decriminalise farmers who make honest mistakes through minor breaches.\nFourthly, unused agri-budget allocations on market management measures should be available for Article 69 aid to strengthen EU agriculture, particularly where production is marginal and to deal with situations, as in my constituency, where there are high numbers of farmers over 55 years of age with no prospect of alternative employment.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jim Allister (NI). – Mr President, there is much in this report that I agree with.
