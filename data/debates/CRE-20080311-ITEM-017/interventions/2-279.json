{"speaker": "Liam Aylward (UEN). –", "english": "Liam Aylward (UEN). – Mr President, I welcome the proposal to simplify the regulatory burden for farmers in the context of the CAP health check and I would urge the Commissioner to give farmers advance notice of cross-compliance inspections when she is examining how to simplify regulations and make them more flexible.\nI am totally opposed to the increasing of compulsory modulation to 13% over the next few years. This would reduce the direct payment to farmers who have already budgeted for this money.\nThere is danger that sheep farming’s vital role in preserving sensitive environmental and ecological areas will be eroded through land abandonment and that husbandry skills would be lost, and this must be addressed and supported in the CAP health check.\nIt is now clear from the last debate that milk quotas will be abolished from April 2015 and I welcome the Commissioner’s contribution to this debate. It is important that there is a soft landing and I would support an annual increase in milk quotas up to 2015.\nFinally, proposals on the table in Geneva regarding the future of EU agriculture in the context of the WTO are totally unacceptable, particularly from an Irish viewpoint. I welcome the fact that many other EU Member States are also opposed to these proposals and that the Commissioner responsible will take account of these concerns.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Liam Aylward (UEN). – Mr President, I welcome the proposal to simplify the regulatory burden for farmers in the context of the CAP health check and I would urge the Commissioner to give farmers advance notice of cross-compliance inspections when she is examining how to simplify regulations and make them more flexible.\nI am totally opposed to the increasing of compulsory modulation to 13% over the next few years.
