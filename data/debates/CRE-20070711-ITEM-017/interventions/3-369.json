(PT) Madam President, very briefly, I believe, as I have said, that the Association Council with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 24 July will enable us to obtain a clearer idea of the progress that has been made in the country, as part of its candidature for full EU membership. Naturally, we await the progress report to be presented by the Commission in the autumn on the state of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s candidature process.\nThe Presidency and the Member States will certainly consider the Commission’s opinion on this question to be very important. Once the country has met the criteria for opening negotiations, those negotiations should, of course, begin.\nThe question of the country’s name or designation has also been mentioned on a number of occasions. During the first Portuguese Presidency in 1992, I was a member of the team – along with Lord Carrington and ambassador José Cutileiro –dealing with the issue of the former Yugoslavia and the question was already being posed at that time. I see that fifteen years later the problem has not gone away. I do hope that the parties can take sit down together at the negotiating table and work out a mutually acceptable solution.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Manuel Lobo Antunes, President-in-Office of the Council .
