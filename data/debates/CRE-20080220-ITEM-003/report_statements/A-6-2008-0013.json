    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Concludes that, taken as a whole, the Treaty of Lisbon is a substantial improvement on the existing Treaties, which will bring more democratic accountability to the Union and enhance its decision-making (through a strengthening of the roles of the European Parliament and the national parliaments), enhance the rights of European citizens vis-à-vis the Union and ameliorate the effective functioning of the Union's institutions;\n",
        "2.  Welcomes the fact that democratic accountability and decision-making powerswill be enhanced, allowing citizens to have greater control over the Union's action, notably due to the following improvements: (a)  the adoption of all European Union legislation will be subject to a level of parliamentary scrutiny that exists in no other supranational or international structure:\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the fact that the rights of citizens will be strengthened as a result of the following improvements: (a)  the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, setting out a complete list of up-to-date civil, political, economic and social rights, will become legally binding; it will give the citizens of the Union legal certainty, ensuringthat all provisions of EU law, and all action taken by the EU institutions or based on EU law, will have to comply with those standards, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity; (b)  the Union is to apply toaccede to the European Convention on Human Rights, which will make the Union subject to the same external review as regards the obligation to respect citizens' rights, as its Member States; (c)  new provisions will facilitate participation by citizens and representative associations of civil society in the deliberations of the Union; dialogue with social partners and dialogue with churches,religious communities and non-confessional organisations will be encouraged; (d)  the introduction of an EU citizens' initiative will enable citizens to submit proposals on matters where they consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties; (e)  judicial protection of citizens will be enhanced, since the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union will extend to matters relating to freedom, security and justice as well as to acts of the European Council, the European Central Bank and agencies of the Union, while provision will also be made to facilitate access for natural and legal persons to proceedings of the court;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the fact that the Treaty establishes in a clearer and more visible way the values, common to all Member States, on which the Union is founded, as well as the objectives of the Union and the principles governing its action and its relations with Member States: (a)  a clear delimitation of the competences of the Union vis-à-vis Member States is established, under the principle that all competences that are not conferred on the Union by the Treaties remain with the Member States; (b)  there is a greater emphasis on policies that visibly benefit citizens: there are new provisions of general application concerning the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, a high level of education, training and health, the elimination of all kinds of discrimination and the promotion of equality between women and men; new provisions enhance the promotion of sustainable development and protection of the environment, including fighting climate change, and the respect of services of general interest; economic, social and territorial cohesion is reaffirmed as an objective of the Union; (c)  the confusion between the “European Community” and “European Union” will end as the European Union becomes one single legal entity and structure; (d)  a solidarity clause between Member States provides citizens with an expectation of receiving support from all parts of the Union in the event of a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster; (e)  it confirms the specificity of the institutional organisation of the Union, to which Member States entrust certain of their competences that they consider to be better exerted through common mechanisms, while providing, for the avoidance of any doubts, sufficient guarantees that the Union will not become a centralised all-powerful superstate:\n",
        "5.  Welcomes the fact that the new Treaty will strengthen the capacity of the Union's institutions to carry out their tasks more effectively, notably because: (a)  the areas in which the governments meeting in the Council decide by qualified majority voting rather than by unanimity will increase substantially, thus enabling the Union of twenty-seven Member States to function in more areas without being blocked by vetoes; (b)  a new system of double majority voting will facilitate reaching decisions in the Council; (c)  theEuropean Council will become a fully-fledged institution of the European Union, and its six-month rotating presidency will be replaced by a President elected by its members for a two-and-a-half-year term, thus allowing for more coherence in the preparation and continuity of its work; (d)  the number of members of the Commission will be reduced, as of 2014, to 2/3 of the number of Member States, thus making it easier for the Commission to act and making it even clearer that Commissioners are representatives of European interests and not of those of their countries of origin, while a rotation system will continue to ensure equal participation of all Member States; (e)  the Union's visibility and capacity as a global actor will be significantly enhanced:\n",
        "6.  Is aware of the widespread regrets that, following the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, it was necessary, in order to secure a fresh agreement amongst the 27 Member States, to:\n",
        "7.  Endorses the Treaty and stresses the need for all Member States of the Union to achieve its ratification in good time for its entry into force on 1 January 2009;\n",
        "8.  Believes that the Treaty of Lisbon willprovide a stable framework which will allow further development of the Unionin future;\n",
        "9.  Is aware that an amending treaty is inevitably less clear and readable than a codified treaty; calls, therefore, forthe rapid publication of the consolidated Treaties as revised by the Treaty of Lisbon, which would provide citizens with a clearer basic text of the Union;\n",
        "10. Reiterates its request that all possible efforts be deployed, both by EU institutions and national authorities in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation, in order to inform European citizens clearly and objectively about the content of the Treaty;\n",
        "11. Instructs its committee responsible to prepare the necessary changes to its Rules of Procedure and to assess the needs for further implementing measures;\n",
        "12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to the national parliaments of the Member States, to the Council, to the Commission and to the former Members of the Convention on the Future of Europe, and to ensure that Parliament's services, including its external offices, provide ample information about Parliament's position on the Treaty.\n"
