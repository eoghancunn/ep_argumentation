One has nevertheless to recognise that some of them will face strong resistance, but the Commission will certainly promote them.\nIn particular, the Commission fully supports the call for consistency between the WTO and other international organisations, and the calls for more transparency as well as for an increased role for parliaments, particularly in the monitoring and trade policy reviews. The Commission also shares the view that a strong WTO is in the interest of the developing countries.\nI would also like to respond to Ms Liotard’s comments, which go beyond the WTO reform. I cannot go into details at this stage, but I would like to assure you that we already engage with our partners regarding child labour and other related issues, and we support the cooperation between ILO and WTO.\nFinally, I would like to say that I will certainly report your comments to my colleague, Mr Mandelson, to be taken fully into consideration in the discussions with other WTO members.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Androula Vassiliou, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments and suggestions, which will be taken into account in the Commission’s thinking about the WTO reform.\nThe Commission shares many of the concerns expressed during the discussion and actually supports many of the proposals put forward by Ms Muscardini’s report.
