{"speaker": "Caroline Lucas,", "english": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Madam President, the Green Group certainly supports the general lines taken in this report, especially the call for more consistency between WTO rule-setting, the work of UN agencies and the existing social, environmental and human rights covenants. We believe that it must include an observer status for the ILO, as well as measures against social and ecological dumping.\nWe also support the role of parliamentary scrutiny in order to mitigate the WTO’s lack of accountability and legitimacy, as well as the need to develop the WTO dispute settlement on the basis of international environmental and social law, ensuring that it has real sanctioning capacities.\nI am concerned, though, that the report fails to acknowledge that the failure of the Doha Round is precisely rooted in the shortcomings of the WTO as an organisation. These are not two separate things. The stalling of the Doha Round is completely linked to the systematic abuses of its decision-making processes by some powerful countries and the resulting alienation of the weaker countries.\nI think the report also fails to recognise that it required nothing less than a revolution on the part of developing countries in Cancún in 2003 and of some of the emerging countries prior to Hong Kong in order to begin to end the old feudal system on which the WTO has been running for far too long. I think it is clear that we should stop waiting until we have an outcome from the Doha Round and immediately start with the reform of the WTO: reform both of its procedures and also of its policies, because reform of process alone is not enough. We need to look at a whole range of rules that are now completely out of date in the 21st century, facing new challenges like climate change.\nSo we need to look at rules like the one on PPMs, for example: the prohibition of distinguishing between products on the basis of which they have been produced. Such discrimination is crucial if we are able to support and promote things like energy efficiency, for example, and fewer emissions.\nWe also want to see a complete refocusing of the dispute settlement proceedings, and I would commend to my colleagues an amendment that the Greens have put down which asks very specifically for a new way of looking at the dispute settlements mechanism, ensuring that it is rooted in the principles of the UN Charter and that it is separated out of the current WTO form.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Madam President, the Green Group certainly supports the general lines taken in this report, especially the call for more consistency between WTO rule-setting, the work of UN agencies and the existing social, environmental and human rights covenants.
