{"speaker": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). - (MT) Thank you Madam President. I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, as well as the Ombudsman for all his hard work. I believe that what unites us in this debate is simple: it is the defence of our citizens, the fact that we can all agree that we must stand guard over our citizens’ rights; that we act as their shield, and that when they find themselves having to deal with unfair authorities and unjust bureaucratic procedures, they should not be made to feel abandoned. On the contrary, they should have every faith that we stand behind them. Therefore, since these are the common factors that bring us together, let us go on working together. In times like these, when our citizens are feeling rather detached from the European Union, it is essential that the Ombudsman, the Commission and the Committee on Petitions work towards building up the consumer’s trust towards the European Union, brick by brick. Let us go on working together to prove that we are indeed worthy of that trust.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). - (MT) Thank you Madam President.
