{"speaker": "Ria Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Ria Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE). - (NL) Mr President, I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for her excellent report. It beggars belief that today, we are discussing a topic that has been on the agenda since 1957, no less, when the equal treatment of men and women, equal pay for men and women were anchored in the Treaties. We have had European rules and laws for 30 years. We have a 2006-2010 road map from the European Commission, and one of the key objectives, which is also included in the Lisbon Strategy, is to narrow the wage gap between men and women.\nDespite this, the wage gap is not getting smaller. In fact, last Saturday, I read in The Times that the difference in wages between men and women in the United Kingdom has increased to 21.7% in the private sector and to 13.8% in the public sector. There is no sign of improvement – take my own country, for example – in other Member States either. The gender report for the Netherlands from the World Economic Forum shows that the Netherlands is only ranked 88 th on the list of equal pay for equal work.\nAction is therefore called for. On Friday, the ministers from France, the Czech Republic and Sweden adopted a plan of action. How many more plans of action do we need though? Mrs Bauer makes a large number of recommendations in the resolution that she submitted, which is great, but there are two priorities in my view. First of all, we must ensure that equal treatment is applied, and much stricter controls should be put in place in this respect – equal pay for men and women on which all our social security systems are based. Secondly – and I really believe that this should be brought to your attention – there is the pension gap between men and women. We are faced with an ageing population, and if women do not have a pension, then we have a deeply sad situation on our hands. That is what we need to focus on in future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ria Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE). - (NL) Mr President, I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for her excellent report.
