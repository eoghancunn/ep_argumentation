I would like to raise one issue, and perhaps the Commission could address this. We are speaking about equal pay for equal work, and we all want and desire that to happen. What is the Commission’s view of the current job situation? I have a concern that, with so many jobs being lost in countries in the European Union, this issue could get worse rather than better because of people’s desire to earn money, even if it is less than they are truly worth. I would like some comments from the Commission on that.\nI would like to raise an issue of discrimination which certainly exists for men and women: public sector versus private sector workers where there are very different terms and conditions. They enjoy different pension rights and security issues and sometimes the inequalities are not just gender-based, although I appreciate that this report is about gender, and certainly my concern is that in the current situation this problem may get worse, rather than better.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). - Mr President, I would like to thank you for this debate.
