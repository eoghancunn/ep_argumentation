Secondly, a fellow Member recently referred to women as being weak. I would like to say that women are not weak. However, it is the patriarchal structures in society that make women weak.\nThe EU Equal Pay Directive has been in existence for 30 years. Despite this, women are still not worth as much as men – either when it comes to pay or influence – both in society and in the workplace. Despite the fact that women generally have a higher education, they earn on average 15% less than men for the same or similar work. It is thus clear that improving the existing legislation will not be sufficient to solve the pay discrimination. The differences in pay between women and men is ultimately yet another indication of the continued discrimination against women in all of the different areas. It is not enough that we have lower pay for equal work, we are also very often forced to take atypical work or part-time work etc. This pay discrimination haunts women right through their lives, as we also often get poorer pension terms and poorer conditions when we get older.\nIt is high time that we took action together to stop this discrimination against women.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL). - (SV) Mr President, I wish firstly to thank Mrs Bauer for an important and constructive report, which I fully support.
