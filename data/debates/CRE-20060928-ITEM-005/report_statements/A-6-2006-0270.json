    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Draws attention to the genuine progress in terms of effectiveness brought by the proposals set out in the Commission's three recent communications and notes the Council conclusions of 11 April 2006, which take over part of the proposals contained in the three communications;\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Member States and the Commission to work towards aid effectiveness within the wider framework of values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN conventions such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;\n",
        "3.  Considers efforts to select 'lead donors' in specific sector areas at country level to be an interesting way forward;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Member States and the Commission together to make every effort to ensure that the European Union speaks with one voice, in order to establish and sustain a leadership based not only on the size of the amounts allocated to development cooperation but also on increased effectiveness;\n",
        "5.  Considers that, for action against poverty to be effective, a much larger proportion of the public development aid (PDA) granted by international donors should be channelled as a priority towards the poorest countries and populations, and regrets the fact that the Union has no specific targets for doing so;\n",
        "6.  Considers that the fisheries agreements concluded with developing countries should be aimed at improving the ability of those countries to properly manage fisheries in their waters, including to control and monitor fishing activities and to conduct scientific research, rather than simply involve payment for the right to catch fish;\n",
        "7.  Believes that for EU aid to be effective, sufficient policy space for  developing countries must be guaranteed and aid effectiveness should be assessed in terms of concrete progress made towards achieving the MDG;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission and all the Member States scrupulously to abide by the objectives and principles established in the European Consensus for Development, particularly the essential objective of combating poverty;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the European Union to defend and promote this policy, which takes due account of human rights and the right of beneficiary states to define their own policies, within all multilateral bodies in which it is represented and in its bilateral relations;\n",
        "10. Calls on the European Union to incorporate in its development policy the recommendations of the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report,  which state that the destruction of the world's ecosystems will act as a barrier to achieving the MDGs, and to take action to reverse the widespread degradation;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to make every possible effort, together and with the other DAC donors, to support the implementation of the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness within this body;\n",
        "12. Encourages the Member States and the Commission to implement without delay the recommendations made by the Commission and taken over by the Council, which will require making a major effort to change - radically, where necessary - their aid systems and/or their procedures for delivering aid, with a view to significantly enhancing their effectiveness by improving programme coordination and ensuring that measures complement each other and policies are consistent;\n",
        "13. Stresses that aid effectiveness must be pursued through a two-pronged approach: focusing on process issues such as coordination, complementarity, harmonisation and alignment, but also on content and substance; stresses that issues such as the fight against corruption, capacity-building linked to serious efforts to prevent the brain drain and disaster risk reduction are key areas in this context;\n",
        "14. Stresses that better coordination should go hand-in-hand with greater complementarity of action involving a better division of work between the Member States themselves and between Member States and the Commission, with a focus at country level and with partner countries in the lead, in order to tackle the problem of orphan countries and sectors, and emphasises the relevance of the Donor Atlas in this connection;\n",
        "15. Stresses that donor coordination and division of labour must follow the lead of the partner country, the aim being alignment with partner country priorities and procedures;\n",
        "16. Acknowledges that coordination and division of labour cannot be conducted in isolation; therefore the European Union must not focus exclusively on internal division of labour but always have a donor-wide perspective;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Member States concerned not to delay in making the budgetary increases required in order to honour the undertakings they have repeatedly made to meet the PDA target of at least 0.56% of GNP by 2010 and 0.7% of GNP by 2015 - without any creative accounting - with the eminently practical aim of releasing additional funding for an effective, enhanced development aid effort, and reminds them of the vital role that they play in this area;\n",
        "18. Calls on the European Union to note the fact that increasing PDA volumes will be meaningless unless it goes hand-in-hand with a significant improvement in terms of the effectiveness and quality of such aid, and accordingly to help ensure that securing such an improvement becomes an absolute priority in the development cooperation policy of each Member State and of the relevant European institutions;\n",
        "19. Calls on each Member State to draw up on an annual and fully transparent basis a detailed list making a clear distinction between the sums directly allocated to development aid and those earmarked for other measures that do not come directly within this sphere, such as debt relief, on the basis of a common reference document drafted by the Commission; insists that such sum be specifically excluded from calculations of total expenditures of development aid;\n",
        "20. Notes that the discussions on the measures that should be deemed to come within the development aid sphere will be continued in 2007 within the OECD's DAC and concluded at the high-level Summit to be held in Ghana at the beginning of 2008, and emphasises its determination to take an active part in those discussions;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to provide it with details of the procedures for the conferral of the mandate it exercises within the OECD's DAC, on how the position it upholds within the committee is defined and on the rules governing the organisation and operation of the committee;\n",
        "22. Urges the members of the OECD's DAC to set targets for 2010 against the twelve indicators established in Paris - in particular with regard to conditionality, mutual responsibility and predictability - and to set up an effective monitoring mechanism;\n",
        "23. Expresses support for the joint programming initiative proposed by the Commission and taken over by the Council, to be conducted for an initial group of 11 ACP States plus Vietnam and Nicaragua, and takes the view that the programming currently under way for the ACP States could be a good start; underlines, however, the importance of making sure that pilot initiatives do not conflict with ongoing joint measures in the partner countries (such as Joint Assistance Strategies) but rather strengthen existing processes;\n",
        "24. Notes and appreciates the work which the Commission has done in terms of developing performance indicators for its activities, but notes also that most indicators relate to internal assessments, that budgetary support and sectoral programmes are not evaluated by these indicators and that there are as yet no impact and sustainability indicators to evaluate projects once implemented;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission and the Member States jointly to identify performance indicators geared to the MDG indicators, in particular with regard to budgetary aid, so that national parliaments and local civil society, as well as the European Parliament, can trace back the results of EU contributions;\n",
        "26. Stresses that joint programming must foster a partnership based on national ownership and mutual accountability;\n",
        "27. Stresses that both aid and trade measures can and must play an important role in achieving the MDGs;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to undertake a study to examine how Fair Trade could develop into a model for sustainable trade policy which would be capable of stimulating balanced North-South trade, and to identify the obstacles to trade which impact most seriously on the world's poorest;\n",
        "29. Recognises the importance of a stabilisation of commodity prices for developing countries and calls on the Commission to suggest measures in this regard;\n",
        "30. Calls on the Commission to clarify the extent to which beneficiary countries and civil society will be in full control of their development policy with the necessary policy space in connection with analysis, diagnosis and the joint strategic policy in order to foster beneficiary countries' response;\n",
        "31. Believes that national and regional development policies must be democratically set by the beneficiary countries themselves and that democratically elected parliaments should exercise closer scrutiny of programme implementation;\n",
        "32. Stresses the important role played by transparency and action against corruption in enhancing aid effectiveness; draws attention, in this connection, to the recommendations set out in its resolution of 6 April 2006 on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries and reaffirms its support for the ‘Publish What You Pay’ campaign, which is calling on multinationals to publish details of payments made to governments;\n",
        "33. Reiterates its recommendations on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries  and calls on the Commission and the Council to reserve an appropriate percentage of budget aid for civil society watchdogs, to establish an international system of blacklisting to prevent banks from lending money to corrupt regimes, to ban procurement contracts with companies that have been involved in corrupt activities within a developing country, and to urge all Member States to ratify the 2003 UN Convention against Corruption;\n",
        "34. Refers, in addition, to the importance of good governance and of a stable, established rule of law, as well as of transparent and predictable regulatory, legal and institutional structures as necessary prerequisites for a climate that is favourable to economic development;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop decentralised cooperation conducted directly with local entities in developing countries;\n",
        "36. Considers that cofinancing could act as a catalyst for European funding and thereby help to bring about the emergence of a genuinely European development cooperation policy;\n",
        "37. Notes the Commission’s proposal to promote the setting-up of a flexible and sustainable instrument for the achievement of the MDGs and calls for further details to be provided regarding the operation and management procedures for this instrument;\n",
        "38. Regrets, unlike the Commission, that some Member States have failed to make satisfactory progress in honouring their undertakings progressively to untie[8]development aid, despite the fact that this is eagerly awaited by local producers and the general population in southern countries, which could draw great benefits from it; calls on the Member States immediately to untie food aid, and the delivery thereof, for the least-developed countries, as is recommended by the OECD;\n",
        "39. Expresses its concern that the EU budget support policy for developing countries is increasingly subject to the conditionalities of international financial institutions , which forces these countries to fulfil International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions in order to secure EU development aid; considers that this centralised conditionality is in contradiction with beneficiary countries' ownership policy;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that stakeholders in beneficiary countries, including civil society organisations, are supplied with the information required in order to make it easier for them to gain access to the programmes on offer;\n",
        "41. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote co-development initiatives, this term being taken to mean the promotion of the potential represented by migrant communities established in developed countries to serve the development of their country of origin;\n",
        "42. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to involve in development programmes skilled persons from the diasporas wishing to provide practical support and to work in their country of origin in order to bring their skills to bear in development-related work in those countries;\n",
        "43. Stresses that, in order to improve effective aid reflected by real progress on the ground, innovative financial instruments and additional resources are absolutely essential and cannot replace the undertakings already made in terms of ODA;\n",
        "44. Warmly welcomes the EU’s firm intention to set up innovative systems as regards financing for development, designed to guarantee aid that is stable, effective and predictable;\n",
        "45. Stresses that the Commission should not be viewed as the twenty-sixth EU donor; instead, the comparative advantage of Community aid should be defined; reiterates the importance of the areas identified in the European Consensus for Development, such as the EU's global presence, the size of its development cooperation budget, the strengthening of  policy coherence, the promotion of development best practice, the facilitation of coordination and harmonisation and the promotion of democracy and human rights etc; calls on the European Union clearly to state its position on this matter;\n",
        "46. Calls on the parliaments of the Member States to exercise closer scrutiny of the funding granted and of the implementation of bilateral cooperation programmes;\n",
        "47. Deplores the fact that the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) initiative has not brought a lasting solution to the debt problem and that the debt situation of most of the countries concerned has not improved, as shown by the report of the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group of March 2006;\n",
        "48. Welcomes the initiative taken by Norway to commission a World Bank and United Nations study on the key issue of the illegitimacy of the debt and encourages the European Union and the Member States to promote this initiative in international forums so that the issue becomes internationally recognised and that audits are carried out on the ‘odious debt’ nature of certain bilateral debts of Member States with a view to their cancellation;\n",
        "49. Regrets that the Council is not prepared to provide new money for aid and trade measures in the Financial Framework for 2007-2013; considers that such measures must not be funded at the expense of other activities aimed at achieving the MDGs; considers that this would be incoherent and unacceptable at a time when new funding instruments and new money are essential;\n",
        "50. Highlights the importance of the ‘Aid for Trade’ initiative, which is designed to help developing countries build on their trade capacity and implement agreements concluded within the WTO so as to take advantage of such agreements and boost their trade, making it easier for them to take part in international trade; in that connection,reiterates its support for the new ‘Aid for Trade’ budget line, which increases both transparency and democratic control;\n",
        "51. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to strengthen coordination in the area of trade-related development cooperation; stresses, in this context, the need for improved donor-wide coordination measures in general, and at field level in particular; stresses the need for the EU to pool its development aid efforts with those of other international donors;\n",
        "52. Considers that EU support in the context of sugar aid to the ACP countries is necessary in order for those countries to be able to adapt to the new constraints resulting from the reform of the European sugar regime; takes the view, on the other hand, that the budget allocated for restructuring aid must not be to the detriment of other activities conducted as part of the EU’s development policy, in particular as regards spending on the MDGs;\n",
        "53. Reminds the Commission of its promise to give developing countries a 'Round for Free' in the WTO; calls on the Commission and the Council to do their utmost to prevent the least developed countries (LDCs) becoming the victims of the interests of strong trading blocs;\n",
        "54. Recognises that the Commission and the ACP countries want to achieve enhanced effectiveness through strengthened regional cooperation via the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs); calls, in this respect, for the necessary safeguards and a realistic timetable for gradual and asymmetric trade opening, to ensure that EPAs stimulate economic growth in the ACP countries in an effective way;\n",
        "55. Calls on all developed countries and all advanced developing countries to follow the example set by the EU’s ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative by ensuring that market access for the LDCs is completely tax- and quota-free;\n",
        "56. Refers to the Commission report which shows that the LDCs benefit least from the EU’s preference system; calls on the Commission to take new measures to enable the poorest countries to derive the greatest possible benefit from EU trade preferences;\n",
        "57. Believes that, although the amount of financial aid earmarked by the European Union is important, it is also important to address substantive reforms of global financial and commercial institutions in order to incorporate a multidimensional and rights- based approach;\n",
        "58. Recalls its aforementioned resolution on the strategic review of the IMF, in which it called on the Member States to work towards a single voting constituency, starting as a Euro constituency, with a view, in the longer term, to securing consistent European representation, involving the Ecofin Council Presidency and the Commission, subject to the European Parliament’s scrutiny;\n",
        "59. Calls for a revision of the operation of International Financial Institutions (IFIs), the first step being to bring the voting system into line with the current situation, by giving added weight to developing countries and revising the currently unbalanced composition of constituencies;\n",
        "60. Calls on IFIs, in view of many United Nations reports, including the aforementioned Sachs report, to ensure that the sustainable nature of the debt of developing countries be taken to mean the debt level enabling a country to achieve the MDGs without increasing its indebtedness, and asks the representatives of Member States in the IFIs to call for the term to be redefined in this way;\n",
        "61. Recalls the suggestion contained in its aforementioned resolution on the strategic review of the IMF that the conditionality linked to IFI aid and loans be defined in the context of improved cooperation with the UN’s institutions, and recognises that this conditionality has, in many cases, had a negative impact on the socio-economic indicators of developing countries;\n",
        "62. Proposes setting up a working group on European aid effectiveness and monitoring of the European Consensus for Development, comprising the members of the Committee on Development, calls on the Commission, the Member States, development NGOs, representatives of civil society and trade union organisations to take part, and suggests, therefore, that a number of countries should be selected as 'case studies' in order to provide Parliament and its Committee on Development with a much better picture of efforts and results at national level;\n",
        "63. Stresses that it is absolutely essential that the Union more systematically conduct policies that are consistent among themselves and welcomes the fact that this issue of consistency between the various policies of the European Union has been entered on the Finnish Presidency’s agenda, a Presidency in which it places the highest expectations;\n",
        "64. Stresses the importance for the effectiveness of aid, particularly at local level, of coherence between the various EU policy areas and of the requisite levels of coordination and complementarity between the EU and its Member States as regards policies; considers that a lack of coherence conflicts with Article 178 of the EC Treaty;\n",
        "65. Considers that the EU aid effectiveness policy should include a coherence between Trade, Development Cooperation and the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies in order to avoid direct or indirect adverse effects on the economies of developing countries;\n",
        "66. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
