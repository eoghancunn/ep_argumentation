        "4.  Emphasises the need to perfect the EU system for type-approval, covering all motor vehicles;\n",
        "5.  Confirms its support for an effective type approval process, as pointed out in its recommendation for second reading of a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, adopted on 10 May 2007[1];\n",
        "6.  Calls on the Commission to report annually to the European Parliament on the operation of type approval procedures and on its monitoring of the comitology process;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Commission to ensure the proper implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002 on motor vehicle distribution throughout the EU (the Block Exemption Regulation); further believes that when that Regulation is reviewed, the Commission Directorate-General for Competition should consider itself part of the integrated approach to legislation in the sector;\n",
        "8.  Proposes that, in order to boost the competitiveness of the motor vehicle industry in the European Union, the review of the Block Exemption Regulation should be tied to the mid-term review of CARS 21, thus facilitating cooperation between sector operators, preventing State aid from being misappropriated and promoting competition policy at international level;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission to propose measures guaranteeing a registration-procedure, which will allow easier cross-border sales especially for used cars; endorses the Commission's views on procedures for the registration of motor vehicles[2]and the problems that some national rules present for the functioning of the internal market; notes the impact of these national rules on economic sectors such as vehicle leasing and rental; calls on the Member States to implement the necessary changes to their rules as soon as possible;\n",
        "10. Draws attention to recently enacted legislative provisions concerning after-market parts that affect safety and environmental performance, and notes that the implementation of these provisions will establish a single market in such parts;\n",
        "11. Welcomes the insertion of provisions in Regulation (EC) No 1715/2007 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 June 2007 on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair information  and in Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002, requiring unrestricted access to appropriate technical repair information, and invites the Commission to continue its efforts to enforce throughout the Community the provisions of competition law that apply to the motor vehicle sector ;\n",
        "12. Calls upon the Commission to continue promoting effective competition in the automotive after-sales market by addressing consumer choice and effective access for independent market operators to technical information, training, spare parts, multi-brand diagnostic tools and test equipment in its future automotive policy and in any successor legislation to Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002, which will expire on 31 May 2010;\n",
        "13. Notes the importance to consumers of in-service reliability and durability information based on comprehensive consumer surveys; notes that public authorities could facilitate these surveys by allowing registration authorities to provide contact details of vehicle owners who agree to participate in them.\n",
        "14. Urges the Commission to properly address the issue of the ‘open reparability’ of vehicles in all new legislative initiatives, involving all relevant Directorates- General, in order to ensure consumer choice and competition in the after-sales market; believes that this should also be applied in the forthcoming measures relating to the promotion of new vehicle information and communication technologies and intelligent transport systems;\n",
        "15. Urges the Commission to submit proposals for the creation of an internal market for custom and tuning parts, such as special tyres, wheels and other tuning parts and spare parts, as the current diversity ofnational regulations obstructs the further development of this sector, which consequently would benefit from Community harmonising legislation and appropriate protection of intellectual property;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission to step up its efforts to combat the import of counterfeit spare parts;\n",
        "17. Stresses the importance of cutting unnecessary red-tape, including the duplication of regulations due to the existence of international conventions;\n",
        "18. Emphasises the crucial role played by the better regulation principles (i.e. proper impact assessment, cost-effectiveness principle, appropriate lead-times, etc.) in creating a competitive regulatory framework for the automotive industry, as endorsed in the CARS21 process; recalls that the regulatory roadmap is an integral part of the final CARS21 report and should be respected;\n",
        "19. Recognises that better designed, transparent rules that are in line with current social and environmental needs,applied without exceptions and integrated into the international automotive regulatory environment can contribute to greater competitiveness and fair competition in the industry;\n",
        "20. Believes that strategic standardisation is an essential driver of competitiveness; therefore requests the Commission to work on having European standards recognised throughout the world;\n",
        "21. Welcomes the Commission's plan to replace 38 Community regulations with existing UN/ECE Regulations, as well as to introduce the possibility of self- or virtual testing, and calls upon the Commission to continue the process of legislative simplification; insists that its support for these proposals is conditional on it being clearly understood that Parliament reserves the right to call for legislation independently from the UN/ECE system where it believes that this is required to meet EU obligations;\n",
        "22. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to submit an annual paper to Parliament on the progress being made at the UN/ECE and in the comitology process;\n",
        "23. Welcomes the Commission’s wish to introduce a revision and review mechanism, given the technology and development-intensive nature of the motor vehicle industry; also considers, however, that greater use should be made of 'sunset clauses' in legislation, so as to ensure that legislation does not hinder or counteract the technological advances that R&D and market forces are constantly bringing about;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission to begin the process of simplifying Directives 71/127/EEC[3], 74/297/EEC[4], 76/115/EEC[5]and 78/932/EEC[6]as well as UN/ECE Regulation No 122 as soon as possible;\n",
        "25. Notes that Community law regulates a market in which between 17 and 18 million vehicles are sold every year, which is equivalent to the passenger car market in the United States; expects that an ambitious emissions reduction policy will have a positive influence worldwide in terms of reducing transport emissions;\n",
        "26. Believes that individual mobility is one the greatest achievements of the last century; believes that mobility and environmental protection are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that future car technology will have to contribute to reconciling the two; indeed, believes that the challenge of climate change in particular presents opportunities for technological advances and innovation;\n",

        "33. In the context of Community legislation, calls on the Commission to begin the process of reassessing and revising emissions testing procedures to better reflect real life conditions of use, without prejudice to the ongoing discussion on CO2emissions from cars;\n",
        "34. Is very concerned at the non-harmonised implementation of the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive[7]; regards that Directiveas not ambitious enough;\n",
        "35. Welcomes the Commission's plans to reduce the CO2emissions of passenger cars; believes that an integrated approach, taking into account all possibilities to reduce CO2emissions, such as infrastructure, driver behaviour, a system of incentives for people to use cleaner cars,biofuels and vehicle technology, to be the most appropriate; encourages the Commission to consider developing a common framework for a coordinated application of technology-neutral and possibly harmonised CO2related fiscal incentives that have a significant CO2reduction potential, while avoid distortions of competition;urges the Council to reach an agreement on the Commission proposal to relate taxes on passenger cars to their polluting emissions such as CO2in order to avoid further internal market fragmentation arising from varying application by Member States;\n",
        "36. Urges the Commission to set ambitious but realistic targets, taking into account the real situation on the EU market where the fleet renewal rate is currently below 10% per annum; therefore emphasises the fact that the affordability of new cars plays a crucial role in achieving the Community target; stresses that the more ambitious the mandatory targets for CO2emissions are, the more time should be granted to the automotive industry to adapt;\n",
        "37. Reminds the Commission of the fact that the development of new types of passenger cars takes between five and seven years; believes that mandatory targets should allow sufficient time for the automotive industry to react; therefore requests the Commission not to set any final mandatory targets for CO2emissions for any date before 2015;\n",
        "38. Believes that an average target of 125g/km of CO2emissions for new passenger cars for 2015 should be achievable; stresses that the Commission should work on more ambitious long-term reduction targets for CO2emissions in the automotive sector; considers it crucial in this connection that the target values should be graduated according to the weight of the vehicle;\n",
        "39. Welcomes the Commission's plan to set a binding bio-fuels target of 10% by 2020, provided that sustainability criteria are observed and encouragement is given for the use of second-generation technology; calls for certification to be developed for sustainably produced biofuels; calls on the Commission in its forthcoming legislative proposal on biofuels to permit only certified sustainable biofuels to be taken into account in achieving the target; stresses that second-generation biofuels from plants or parts of plants not in direct competition with food plants and offer greater efficiency must be developed and promoted still further;\n",
        "40. Notes that, in order to achieve the aim of increasing the use of biofuels and hydrogen to maximise environmental performance, it is vital to promote the necessary local networks to enable citizens to obtain supplies;\n",
        "41. Takes the view that measures to reduce CO2 emissions should place greater emphasis on raising driver awareness of economical driving techniques and of how best to make use of new technologies;\n",
        "42. Believes that increasing consumer awareness through better labelling of fuel efficiency and better data on polluting emissions will contribute to achieving CO2reductions; therefore calls for a revision of Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars, taking into account best practices currently achieved;\n",
        "43. Recalls the fact that the reduction of CO2emissions from cars can most easily be achieved by restructuring public transport systems;\n",
        "44. Recognises the leading role played by the Federation Internationale d’Automobile (FIA) at the forefront of innovative environmental technology changes that offer potential CO2reduction and efficiency saving spin-offs for all new cars;\n",

        "56. Submits that the EU automotive industry is one of the most competitive industries in the world; believes however that unfair competition and the infringement of intellectual property rights threaten this position;\n",
        "57. Stresses the importance of the WTO for the automotive industry in an increasingly global trading environment; considers it highly important that the current negotiations in the Doha Development Round make third country markets as accessible as possible for automobile manufacturers, especially potentially large, emerging third country markets;\n",
        "58. Stresses the importance of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism in resolving problems relating to exports to third countries; recalls the positive outcome of the disputes brought before the WTO in the cases of Canada, India and Indonesia;\n",
        "59. Calls for caution in the Commission's efforts to revise trade defence instruments in principle; recalls that the automotive industry may be subject to anti-competitive practices by third countries and urges the Commission to safeguard the basic philosophy of trade defence instruments in defending EU industry from unfair practices;\n",
        "60. Recalls that the successful conclusion of multilateral trade negotiations should remain a priority for the EU; nevertheless supports the Commission's will to negotiate new bilateral trade agreements, primarily in Asia, in order to improve market access conditions; stresses that Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) should always aim at a high level of access to the market of the partner country; insists that EU policy must safeguard the competitiveness of EU automobile manufacturers operating in the EU and in non-EU countries; is convinced of the importance for the automotive industry of concluding bilateral agreements between the EU and ASEAN, India and Mercosur;\n",
        "61. Urges the Commission, in the framework of the current EU-Korea FTA negotiations, to make sure that Korea abolishes all existing tariff and non-tariff barriers and does not create new ones, and that it will implement more UN/ECE regulations; requests that the Commission considers a strategy of phasing out EU import tariffs with safeguards and, therefore, recommends that this phasing out be connected to the lifting of non-tariff barriers on the Korean side;\n",
        "62. Reiterates that Korea has signed and ratified the 1958 UN/ECE Agreement and has thus committed itself to implementing the UN/ECE regulations; urges the Commission to stress this during future negotiations and to insist on rapid implementation; notes that an FTA should in any case clearly provide that Korea must permit cars imported from the EU that meet UN/ECE standards to be placed on the Korean market;\n",
        "63. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the possibility of setting up an Autos Working Group and a special expedited dispute settlement procedure in relation to automobile-related measures, as was introduced in the US-Korea FTA;\n",
        "64. Emphasises the importance of a close partnership with China in the development of a regulatory framework offering a level playing field; states that effective protection of IPR is a precondition for such a partnership;\n",
        "65. Disagrees with the Commission's proposal to abolish design protection rights, as this might have a negative effect on the automotive sector in the EU while not guaranteeing any customer benefits; calls on the Commission to respect the existing level playing-field in relation to Japan and certain US States, where very high standards are in force;\n",
        "66. Welcomes the Commission's request for the establishment of a WTO panel to resolve outstanding issues relating to the treatment of imported vehicle parts by China, which the Commission argues is inconsistent with several articles of different WTO agreements;\n",
