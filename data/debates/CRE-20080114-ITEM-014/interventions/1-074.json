(LT) I congratulate Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis for preparing this report. The car industry really is one of the most important ones. 2.3 million people work directly in it and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors. This makes 7 percent of all the people working in the industrial sector of the Community. Members of the Community must take care of those people who could lose their jobs due to structural changes in advance and prepare for this appropriately. Currently, problems are solved only when they occur. We have to ensure that Community funds allocated for enterprises undergoing reconstruction directly reach the employees. Most especially, it is necessary to support those who want to start their own business – I have in mind the Globalisation Fund. Humanity is the most important when various changes take place and our responsibility is to take care of the Community's citizens, protect them from unemployment and effectively use social guarantees. Only this can help to gain the confidence of people.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ona Jukneviciene, reporter of the opinion of the Employment and Social Committee . ?
