    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Calls on the Member States to abolish the transitional measures in force, given that there are no signs of strain on the labour markets of the Member States which have opted for openness without restrictions and that the fears of massive migration have proved groundless;\n",
        "2.  Notes that the transitional periods are a major contributory factor to higher levels of illicit working and sham self-employment, and will increasingly lead to regionally acute wage pressure and unfair working conditions, as well as to discrimination against and the exploitation of migrant workers;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Member States to enforce the status quo clause and preference rule in the Accession Treaty whereby, when a post is vacant, nationals of the new Member States have priority over third-country nationals;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the Commission to institute proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty without delay should any Member State fail to fulfil its obligations under Articles 12, 39, and 42 of the Treaty or the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty;\n",
        "5.  Regrets that several Member States are applying laws or administrative provisions that could be considered to impose greater restrictions on the freedom of movement of workers from the new Member States than those imposed when the Accession Treaty was signed; concludes that the extent of the restrictions imposed on nationals of the new Member States seeking to enter the EU-15 labour markets exceeds that authorised under the transitional arrangements;\n",
        "6.  Deplores the fact that measures based on discrimination between nationals of the EU-15 and the new Member States remain in force in some Member States, not least where access to social advantages is concerned; calls on Member States to repeal these discriminatory measures;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that labour law is strictly enforced so as to guarantee that all EU workers are treated equally, that there is fair competition among businesses, and that social dumping is prevented; calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure that migrant workers are aware of their fundamental rights and obligations, in particular with regard to anti-discrimination legislation in line with Article 13 of the Treaty;\n",
        "8.  Urges the Commission and the Member States to increase their efforts to ensure the proper enforcement of existing EC legislation, labour standards and, in particular, the provisions of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services[7], with appropriate reinforcement of administrative cooperation where justified;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission to intensify cross-border joint action by the Member States’ labour inspectorates and to study the possibility of setting up a corresponding European cooperation network (i.e. a social Europol);\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission, the Member States, the two sides of industry and other specialised bodies in the public and/or private sector to establish a fair, transparent procedure enabling nationals of the new Member States to obtain employment under decent conditions of work, health and safety;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission and the Council to produce, by January 2009 at the latest, standardised statistics on intra-EU migration, to set up a system for the systematic monitoring of migration of workers within the EU, and to provide the funds necessary to finance these actions;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission, the Council, and the Member States to launch an information campaign aimed at the public at large with a view to informing citizens more fully about the principles underlying, and the consequences of, the freedom of movement of workers within the EU and to help combat discrimination based on nationality, race or, indeed, any other discrimination prohibited under Article 13 of the Treaty;\n",
        "13. Calls on the EU-15 to consult the two sides of industry as necessary, in accordance with national custom and practice, before deciding whether to end or extend transitional arrangements concerning the freedom of movement of workers from the new Member States;\n",
        "14. Calls on those Member States that wish to continue transitional arrangements to create during the next stage the conditions to ensure that the transitional arrangements are not continued beyond 2009;\n",
        "15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, and the parliaments of the Member States and the accession and the candidate countries.\n"
