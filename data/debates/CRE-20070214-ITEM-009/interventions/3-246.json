{"speaker": "Proinsias De Rossa,", "english": "Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Madam President, terrorist acts are always criminal, but terrorism is also always a political project. I think its current manifestation aims to subvert the humanitarian values of equality, whether it be between gender, religion or nationality. It also seeks to undermine civil rights – the civil rights of a plural democracy.\nBut we have to be very careful in expressing those values. If we choose to call them ‘our’ values rather than treating them as universal values, I think we will fall into the trap of the ‘clash of civilisations’. Our best defence of those values, therefore, has to be primarily political. We must demonstrate the strength of those values by ensuring freedom and quality of life for all in Europe and globally.\nSecurity measures certainly have to be applied: the collection of intelligence, the prosecution of lawbreakers and, indeed, the prevention and prosecution of incitement to hatred and violence. But the Fava report, which we spent a long time discussing this morning, indicates what can go badly wrong if we are not extremely careful. We have to avoid simplistic analysis. We have to avoid the assumption that every political or religious fundamentalist is a terrorist – that is simply not true, and I think it is important that we bear that in mind. I know lots of fundamentalist Catholics who would be appalled at the idea that anybody would commit a terrorist act in their name.\nI would appeal for deeper analysis than we are currently getting, and caution about the language we are using. I would argue that, if we are going to be successful, we have to deal with inequalities on our continent, but also inequalities globally as well.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Madam President, terrorist acts are always criminal, but terrorism is also always a political project.
