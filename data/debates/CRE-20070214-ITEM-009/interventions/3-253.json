{"speaker": "Tunne Kelam (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Tunne Kelam (PPE-DE). – Madam President, This is a very important report with different emphases.\nOne of the big problems seems to be that numerous states have not been willing to counter the terrorist threat efficiently. As you mentioned, Madam Commissioner, even several UN member states have not been able to agree on an international definition of terrorism.\nAgainst this background I think the main challenge for us is to strengthen and enhance the efficiency of transatlantic cooperation and coordination. That also means fully implementing the EU-US cooperation declarations. I wonder whether concentrating on suspicions and accusations might give the misleading impression that US intelligence is not our ally but the main adversary.\nAt the same time, I would like to pay tribute to our own anti-terrorist efforts. They have succeeded in preventing many new terrorist attacks in the UK, Germany and the United States. But the urgent need is obviously for closer cooperation between the EU Member States and special agencies. I can only support the idea that the EU anti-terrorist coordinator be given a stronger mandate and more resources.\nI think paragraph 9 is especially relevant. It states that one of the EU’s external actions should be aimed at preventing extremist groups and states from resorting to terrorism. I think this is a key to practical solutions. Without the support of such states as Iran, terrorist initiatives will be dramatically reduced.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Tunne Kelam (PPE-DE). – Madam President, This is a very important report with different emphases.\nOne of the big problems seems to be that numerous states have not been willing to counter the terrorist threat efficiently.
