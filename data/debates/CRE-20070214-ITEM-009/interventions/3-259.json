{"speaker": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner,", "english": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission . Madam President, I think this report and the debate on its adoption confirm the importance of the fight against terrorism not only for the Member States, but also for the European Union as a whole. It also demonstrates that respect for human rights has to remain the core of our counter-terrorism policies. I think our colleague is right: it has to be with patience, but also with persistence, that we fight against terrorism.\nI would like to make just a few comments. First, on the question of security and development, I said that I personally have always clung to the system of human security. Why? Because I think there is no development without security and no security without development. Therefore, freedom from fear – i.e. security for citizens – and freedom from want – i.e. prosperity rather than poverty – have to be our goal and, therefore, this is as much as a development issue as it is a foreign policy issue.\nSecond, I would also like to speak about the victims of terrorism.\n(ES) I welcome the victims of terrorism who are here with us.\nVictims of terrorism require our full attention, and the ways to assist them are under discussion in a number of international fora. The Commission will also follow these discussions with the greatest interest. Furthermore, assistance to victims of terrorism is provided through a number of financial programmes run by the services of Vice-President Frattini, and also by ourselves: for instance, in Colombia, where we are working hard on the reinsertion of former soldiers of the different terrorist organisations.\nDialogue between cultures and civilisations is also highly important, and I cannot agree that this should be restricted to extremist and fundamentalist Islamists. They exist, but there are also other terrorists. Therefore, please let us not restrict the debate to this group alone: it is much broader, and it is very important that we not only respect different religions and civilisations, but also that we work with each other, talk to each other and have an ongoing dialogue.\nI should also like to say a word on the issue of the Internet, which is one of the important areas under discussion in the G8, in the Rome/Lyons Group. There are a lot of complexities, since important aspects – for instance, freedom of the press – are involved, not least in the United States. What is involved? Sharing knowledge, helping to understand terrorists, the use of the Internet for radicalisation and recruitment, for propaganda and fund-raising, sharing best practices, how we can work against it on a voluntary basis, fine methodologies, etc. I just wanted to say to Mr Belder that there is quite a lot going on.\nFinally, it is in this spirit that the Commission will also examine the very important remarks and recommendations that have been made and are included in this report. The overall objective remains to improve the efficiency and coherence of our collective efforts, and I think cooperation between the three institutions will be key to success in the long run.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Member of the Commission .
