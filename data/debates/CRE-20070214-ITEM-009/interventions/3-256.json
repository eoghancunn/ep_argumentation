{"speaker": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). – Madam President, this report starts from the false premise that international terrorism constitutes the greatest threat to the democratic international community. Likewise, President Bush’s concept of a war on terror is mistaken.\nViolence and terrorism are only means to an end. The greatest threat to the free democratic world comes from an ideology. The ideology in question is that of the fundamentalist and extremist Islam, which by means of terror seeks first to impose its psychological, and then ultimately its physical dominion on the world. They believe that time and demography are on their side and they have declared war on us.\nSun Tzu remarked that the first place to win a war is in the mind of the enemy. Islamic fundamentalists might conclude that they are well on the road to winning that war when its victims do not confront the fundamental cause of the problem. The solution is not for the European Union to concentrate more power in its hands, as is predictably recommended in this report. The solution is to recognise that fundamentalist, extremist and literal Islam is incompatible with Western liberal democracy and indeed any kind of civilisation. From that starting point we can begin to adopt concrete measures to combat its manifestations through the actions of nation states and international cooperation.
