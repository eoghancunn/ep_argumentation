    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Supports the need for a strategic objective of combating terrorism globally, respecting human rights, with the ultimate objective of achieving a more secure European Union, and allowing its citizens to enjoy a true area of freedom, security and justice; shares the view of the Council that, other forms of terrorism notwithstanding, the most serious threat to Europe at the moment is posed by violent radical groups claiming to defend Islam, such as the criminal Al Qaeda network and the groups which are affiliated to it or are inspired by its ideology;\n",
        "2.  Emphasises the need for the European Union, its Member States and its partner countries to base their global counter-terrorism strategy on the fundamental principles which also serve to guide the actions of the United Nations, on a constructive and serious dialogue between peoples and nations, as well as between cultures, religions and civilisations, taking account of the respective perceptions and concerns, and on respect for international law;\n",
        "3.  Expresses its regret at the failure of the UN World Summit in 2005 to reach an agreement on a comprehensive definition of terrorism, and stresses the need to arrive at a generally accepted definition of international terrorism; therefore calls on the Council to adopt a common position establishing a definition of terrorism on the basis of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002[2]and taking into account the definition proposed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan;\n",
        "4.   Stresses the urgent need to fully and properly implement all the political measures adopted at the highest political level in the European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the Action Plan and the Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism, so that the ambitious mechanisms and proposals set out in these documents result in specific and effective practical measures to combat terrorism as soon as possible;\n",
        "5.    Welcomes the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and annexed Plan of Action; stresses the need for terrorism in all its forms and expressions to be combated by all available means, pursuant to the UN Charter as reflected in the Security Council’s Resolution 1624(2005);expresses concern at the delay in the adoption of the global convention on international terrorism; encourages the Institutions of the European Union and the various Member States to continue working unstintingly to achieve an international consensus permitting, on the one hand, the adoption of the global convention and, on the other, the effective implementation of the measures set out in said Strategy and Plan of Action;\n",
        "6.    Regrets the fact that, despite evidence of the terrorist threat, some Member States have not yet signed and/or ratified some of the 16United Nations universal instrumentson combating terrorism; notes that as yet only two countries have ratified 13 conventions and 78 other countries have ratified or joined 12 of them; considers it particularly worrying, however, that 33 other countries have ratified or joined 6 or fewer such international conventions;\n",
        "7.   Calls on those Member States of the European Union and their partners which have not already done so to adopt swiftly the national legislation necessary for the effective implementation of these conventions and to inform the relevant bodies of the United Nations thereof in good time;\n",
        "8.   Recommends that the European Union in its external actions makes use of appropriate means in order to encourage countries to become parties to all universal instruments against terrorism and to enact, as appropriate, the domestic legislation necessary to implement the provisions of those conventions and protocols, also benefiting from the UN technical expertise;\n",
        "9.      Emphasises that the European Union's external actions to combat international terrorism should in the first place be aimed at prevention, in order to ensure that radical or extremist groups, and also States; do not resort to terrorism and do not support it as a strategy in the pursuit of their objectives; urges the Member States to acquire greater institutional capacity for combating terrorism; considers that in broad terms the objectives relating to prevention set out in the European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy are in keeping with this objective;\n",
        "10.     Calls on the countries with which the EU has commenced accession negotiations or which have expressed their intention of joining the EU to take immediate measures to disband nationalistic and fanatical organisations which are directly opposed to the democratic principles of the Union and stir up animosities and racial hatred;\n",
        "11.   Reiterates the need at all times to drive home the message that terrorism is unacceptable and unjustifiable by all state and non-state actors in all circumstances and in all cultures, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify it, and to eliminate all factors which may be exploited by terrorists such as the dehumanisation of victims, the outbreak and persistence of violent conflicts, bad governance, the lack of civil rights and violation of human rights, religious and ethnic discrimination, political exclusion and socio-economic marginalisation;\n",
        "12.   Considers it also fundamental that the European Union's external actions to combat international terrorism, while complying with the relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the European Court of Human Rights, should aim to prevent terrorists from gaining access to the means for carrying out their attacks, for example by depriving them of the opportunity to travel, to gain access to means of communication and to proselytise, to use the Internet for their purposes, to receive financial support, to engage in money laundering, to gain access to arms, be they conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological, and to easily attain their objectives and achieve their aims;\n",
        "13.   Considers that the protective measures included in the European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy are in line with this objective but that their actual effectiveness varies greatly and that there are various other options in terms of the Union's external action;\n",
        "14.   Reiterates the need to fight against flows of illicit capital and money laundering within the Union (through implementation of Directive 2005/60/EC by December 2007) and elsewhere and to exercise effective control over various Islamic charities;\n",
        "15.    Notes that States have an obligation to exercise vigilance andrecommends that determined use be made of the instruments to obstruct any violation of that international obligationat the disposal of the Union in its external actions in order to make countries which support terrorist groups and which organise, finance, encourage or support terrorist activities by any other means desist, if necessary through the imposition of sanctions or through coercive measures;\n",
        "16.   Supports unreservedly the development of the capacity of States to prevent terrorism through the promotion of the rule of law, the respect of human rights and the establishment of effective criminal justice systems as well as through the promotion of high-quality education, religious and cultural tolerance; to that end, urges all the States within the international community to ensure that incitement to commit terrorist acts is banned by law and to prevent such conduct, as called for in the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (60/288), which was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 September 2006;\n",
        "17.    Considers that the development of a preventative capacity also requires States to directly oppose the financing of terrorist organisations by practical means, to seek to ensure that transport is safe (as stipulated in the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP)), to make use of the possibilities offered by the Internet to combat terrorism, to improve the protection of potential terrorist targets and the capacity to respond to attacks as well as to improve their capacity to prevent terrorists from acquiring conventional weapons or nuclear, biologic, chemical or radiological materials;\n",
        "18.   Emphasises the need to continue defending human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism by means of the international instruments available, taking account of the fact that human rights are a universal value and an integral part of European external action but also of the fact that their violation clearly jeopardises the fight against terrorism and constitutes a failure of democracy; considers, therefore, that the only effective instruments employed in the fight against international terrorism are legal means and that all activities that escape independent international scrutiny, such as extraordinary renditions or prisons that operate outside the international legal framework, should be prohibited under international law;\n",
        "19.    Considers it fundamental to have sufficient human and budgetary resources available to combat terrorism; supports the various proposals of the Commission in this regard; proposes that, in the event of an ESPD operation to combat terrorism, the cost of the common expenditure be charged to the budget of the European Union; supports the creation of an international fund to provide economic assistance to States with fewer resources in order that they may successfully assume their responsibilities in the fight against terrorism;\n",
        "20.   Draws attention to the fact the development of a common approach to the management of the European Union's external frontiers could constitute one element of the fight against terrorism, and consequently is concerned that the technical equipment at the disposal of the authorities responsible for controlling the borders is not of a uniformly high standard;\n",
        "21.   Underlines the crucial role of civil society as well as of NGOS for the promotion of cross- cultural and inter-religious understanding through constructive dialogue;\n",
        "22.   Considers that it is essential to develop intercultural dialogue and other confidence-building measures within and outside the EU with the first requirement being to reach a common understanding of the concept of 'intercultural dialogue' inside the EU; furthermore, considers that it is also essential to examine the contributory factors leading to the radicalisation and recruitment of Muslims inside and outside Europe;\n",
        "23.   Emphasises the multiple-faceted nature of the responses available to the European Union in the area of external action to combat terrorism and the need for Member States to bring together and use in a coherent manner theirpolitical, preventive and repressive, police and judicial cooperation, intelligence and communication instruments and all other types of responses called for and backed up by the United Nations and forming part of a multilateral strategy;\n",
        "24.   Reiterates, therefore, its proposal to render the Union’s anti-terrorist policy more coherent and effective in its relations with third countries through: (a)  the enhancement of political dialogue in this regard, in particular with those countries with which the European Union and/or its Member States have concluded or are negotiating Association or Cooperation Agreements, (b)    political and commercial support and development aid to moderate Islamic countries,relating both to the fight against terrorism and to the social, political and economic reforms implemented in those countries; (c)   a stepping up of the dialogue on and cooperationinthe fight against terrorism with the major partners of the Union, (Israel, Japan, Australia, Canada, Russia etc.), and, in particular, the United States, which is in the front line in the fight against terrorism, without affecting the level of protection for human rights under any circumstances; (d)   the promotion of international consensus for the adoption of the Global Convention on International Terrorism and the development of the Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly, (e)    the requirement that all third countries with which the Union maintains relations sign and ratify the 16 United Nations universal instruments on combating terrorism, as well as the optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, (f)    the strict implementation of the anti-terrorism clause as well as application of the human rights clauseincluded in agreements with third countries, without any ‘ad hoc’ modifications which detract from theirsubstance, (g)    the suspension of political and trade relations with States which persistently fail to comply with their obligations towards the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the United Nations, (h)    the establishment of an interinstitutional Code of Conduct for external relations of the Union proposed by the European Parliament alreadyin 2002, (i)     the strengthening of cooperation with international and regional organisations playing a key role in peace keeping and global security, first and foremost the United Nations (in particular the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) the OSCE, the Council of Europe and NATO, (j)    the promotion and strict implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004), with the aim of preventing non-state actors and States which are not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty from acquiring nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, in pursuit of the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to develop and support new initiatives on nuclear disarmament and the revitalisation of the UN Conference on Disarmament, (k)   the stepping-up of cooperation as regards the exchange of information and cooperation between security and intelligence services including military intelligence, and police, judicial and customs authorities of the Member States, including with SitCen, Frontex, Europol, Interpol and Eurojust and the various competent authorities at European level, the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Gijs De Vries and the Commissioner with responsibility for justice, freedom and security, Franco Frattini; the enhancing of security protocols and interoperability, by keeping the activities of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies strictly separate as stipulated in numerous national constitutions and on the condition that parliamentary and judicial scrutiny are provided, (l)      the organisation of regular meetings (held at least once a year) to be attended by the relevant ministers from the Member States, by the Commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security, by the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator and by the heads of Europol, Eurojust, SitCen and Frontex, and to be devoted solely to the topic of combating international terrorism; (m)    the promotion of a global consensus about the need to put an end to off-shore banking and other forms of opaque fiscal paradises used by terrorists to conceal financial transactions; (n)    the implementation of the Firearms Protocol and the UN Small Arms and Light Weapons Action Programme; (o)   the reinforcement of counter-terrorist military unit through training and other measures; (p)   an increase in Europol’s powers in order to ensure that the role it plays in the fight against terrorism is an effective one; (q)    the enhancement of cooperation with the United States as regards exchange of information and cooperation between security and intelligence services as well as police, judicial and customs authorities; (r)     the enhancement of cooperation of Member States' special forces with those of third party states;\n",
        "25.    Commends the various initiatives to promote dialogue, tolerance and understanding among different cultures, civilisations and religions; considers the idea of creating a \"Euro- Med citizenship\" as an example of a broad and concrete initiative that can help bring forward views of the region's common future;\n",
        "26.   Emphasises the need for greater cooperation and coordination with the United States in the fight against international terrorism, while stressing the need for fundamental human rights principles to be protected;\n",
        "27.   Emphasises the need for an increase in the powers and the resources available to the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator (with particular reference to the inadequate resources made available to him), so that his work can assume a higher profile and have greater impact;\n",
        "28.   Calls on the Commission and the Council, in order to make the International Criminal Court (ICC) more acceptable and realistic, to include acts of terrorism within its jurisdiction, as these constitute crimes against humanity;\n",
        "29.   Calls on the Council, Commission and the governments of the Member States to take effective practical action in following up the proscription of terrorist organisations;\n",
        "30.   Considers it essential to encouragegreater stability outside the Union through the use of all available instruments, programmes and means in the ambit of external action, including: (a)   the new Stability Instrument, which should provide a new legal basis for long-term aid in the area of the fight against terrorism, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fight against organised crime, conventional disarmament and human security; recalls the declaration by the Commission on anti-terror measures, annexed to the Instrument for Stability, in which the Commission undertakes that all anti-terrorism measures financed under that instrument will respect human rights obligations and related humanitarian law and that the Commission will monitor compliance by the recipient countries; (b)   the support, once said Instrument enters into force, of the aid strategy designed by the Commission to help third countries face the terrorist threat through both the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENPI) programmes, the Instrument for Stability and the mainstreaming of counter-terrorist assistance into all its assistance programmes as requested by the European Council; (c)    the extension of said strategy to all areas of the Union’s external action and to all the major development aid programmes except for those on humanitarian aid, which by their very nature are unconditional; (d)    the strengthening of the use Civilian and Military Rapid Reaction Mechanism; (e)    the Council and the Commission ensuring that attention for the victims of terrorism becomes a cornerstone of the Union's policy in this field, thus ensuring full regard for them so that they are listened to, kept informed and given every assistance; (f)     the creation of a similar office in the context of the new United Nations Counter-Terrorism Strategy aimed at providing assistance to all victims of terrorism regardless of their citizenship;\n",
