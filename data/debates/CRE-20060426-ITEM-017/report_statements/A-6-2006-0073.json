    "paragraphs": [
        "1.Recalls that State aid should remain the exception: an instrument to correct imbalances that cannot be addressed by regular policy instruments; underlines the importance of guaranteeing coherence between such measures and those aimed at reducing unnecessary regulation and introducing further deregulation measures, investing in education and training, providing adequate infrastructure, ensuring that the patent regime is conducive to innovation, ensuring fair competition, facilitating access to risk capital, encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit, removing obstacles to the freedom of movement of workers and researchers within the EU, and adopting a common policy for legal immigration, which enables the EU to attract the best and the brightest;\n",
        "2.Stresses that further clarification is needed on how State aid rules will apply to international cross-border economic activities of companies, research establishments and academic institutions;\n",
        "3.Considers that State aid for innovation should be complementary to the corresponding uniform Community policies and should have a clear, measurable added value for the immediate beneficiaries as well as a secondary impact on the broader local, regional and national economy;\n",
        "4.Stresses the need to draw conclusions from past cases in which State aid failed to achieve its aim, as well as from those cases in which it proved to be an effective instrument for attaining the desired objectives;\n",
        "5.Welcomes the Commission's open consultation and encourages the continuation of dialogue in order to clarify all points before finalisation of the new framework, which should be implemented as soon as possible; considers, given that the objective of innovation is multidimensional and complex, that very restrictive definitions and arrangements should be avoided and recommends that provision should be made for an interim date for revising the framework in the event of it needing improvements; notes, moreover, that the revision of the Oslo Manual, which lays down the methodological framework for measuring innovation, should be taken into account;\n",
        "6.Asks the Commission to provide more detailed information about the possible distortional effects of State aid and to take into account State aid granted by the EU's international competitors, both at sectoral and horizontal level and its possible distortional and incentive effects on a global scale; points out that the effective governance of innovation policy, international benchmarking, trans-national policy learning, monitoring, and impact assessments are the most appropriate responses to the challenges of global competition;\n",
        "7.Welcomes the approach of incorporating new rules, which support concrete and well-identified innovation-related activities, in the existingacquis communautaire, provided that this is done in a coherent and transparent way;\n",
        "8.Welcomes the economic approach to State aid for innovation and would welcome the introduction ofex anterules, where appropriate, if these are transparent, non-discriminatory, practicable, and provide for legal certainty; insists that the Commission, in close cooperation with Parliament, periodically review and evaluate the appropriateness of such rules; it should also be emphasised that criteria for granting subsidies for innovation should be conditional on several factors, such as the characteristics of the economic sector, the market structure, and the market power of the company;\n",
        "9.Insists that the promotion of cross-border cooperation and public-private partnerships in the field of research, the dissemination of the results of research, and major research programmes should be fundamental priorities of State aid for R&D;\n",
        "10.Insists that State aid for innovation should be temporary, granted according to transparent and rational criteria, proportionate, strictly and effectively controlled, and subject to periodic impact assessments throughex postanalyses conducted by the Member States and the Commission; insists also that State aid should take into account 'the remoteness from the market', in other words, the non-commercial phase of the innovation process; stresses that the increasing importance of innovation must not be a pretext for granting State aid to companies;\n",
        "11.Recalls that innovation is an integral part of all business activities and stresses that rules and criteria must clarify that innovative processesper sedo not merit State aid; stresses that State aid should be granted only for innovations that cannot be financed by normal commercial means and that contribute to the overall goals of business life and society;\n",
        "12.Considers the term 'market inefficiency' more appropriate than 'market failure', and asks for a more detailed and operational definition; suggests that the identification of obstacles limiting innovation, as well as the quantification of its effective value, should be subject to further scrutiny;\n",
        "13.Stresses the need for reliable statistical data both on market and on State aid inefficiencies in the field of innovation, as well as on the effectiveness of State aid for innovation;\n",
        "14.Recognises that SMEs and start-ups are most affected by market inefficiencies; notes, at the same time, that the effect of State aid is less distorting when granted in favour of activities at a distance from the market or SMEs and start-ups;\n",
        "15.Stresses the need to create an innovation-friendly environment for SMEs in order to stimulate their untapped innovation potential;\n",
        "16.Stresses that the importance in this connection of SMEs, which, by their nature, have only limited funds at their disposal, makes it necessary for them to be allocated a higher proportion of the aid available; to make this possible, a greater role needs to be played by the innovation intermediaries referred to in the document, once their nature and role has been clarified further and the necessary infrastructure which they should provide has been extended to include IT infrastructure, and networking and link-up to international databases;\n",
        "17.Points out that SMEs are often not willing to undertake the high risks associated with technological innovation, even though this could not only bring individual benefits, but could also potentially benefit society as a whole; stresses the need to urgently target State aid at supportive actions that motivate SMEs and diminish the risks linked to technological innovation processes, as well as the need to improve the overall conditions of the business environment;\n",
        "18.Regards large companies as an essential component of the innovation system and therefore considers that State aid to large companies is permissible if the companies cooperate with others (large businesses, small businesses, knowledge institutions) and provided that they meet the criteria of theex anterules;\n",
        "19.Is aware that State aid may be necessary in order to set in motion innovative projects or scientific or technological research projects which are distant from the marketplace;\n",
        "20.Notes that the incentive effect of different State aid instruments is difficult to demonstrate but may be facilitated by a standardised set of questions; considers that as little use as possible should be made of direct grants;\n",
        "21.Questions the distinction between technological and non-technological innovation; notes the importance of non-technological innovation, particularly in the acquisition of competitive advantages by SMEs; favours, instead, a definition of innovation distinguishing between the regular day-to-day operations of companies and their activities relating to innovation; proposes that projects eligible for State aid should be those that provide additional or new client benefits, entail risk, are intentional, have transferable benefits, and create positive externalities;\n",
        "22.Considers that regional bonuses are inappropriate if State aid cumulation is permitted; considers that regional aid schemes, whenever additional to State aid for innovation, must be compatible with the internal market and competition rules; considers, moreover, that particular importance should be attached to the definition of and eligibility for State aid for innovation in relation to regional SMEs for which it is vitally important to have access to innovation;\n",
        "23.Calls on the Commission to make the regional aid schemes more forward-looking, allowing, in particular, support for intangible investments;\n",
        "24.Calls on the Commission to ensure that EU structural funding will not be regarded as unlawful State aid when combined with co-funding from other sources; further asks that the relevant procedures be modified so that dual notification to the Commission of such funding is avoided;\n",
        "25.Agrees that State aid should be allocated on the basis of criteria favouring innovative businesses, rather than on the basis of eligible costs; notes that decisions on the grant of State aid should be taken in an efficient manner and within clearly defined time lines;\n",
        "26.Proposes that the existence period requirement be extended to eight years for companies with a longer R&D cycle;\n",
        "27.Supports the proposal that financial support is given by means of risk capital not only for the seed and start-up phase, but also for the post-seed phase; stresses, however, that this solution is not optimal and that any aid should be of a short-term character and complementary to primarily private investments;\n",
        "28.Emphasises that the limits on R&D costs should be carefully monitored;\n",
        "29.Notes that in regions and countries in which the innovation environment is particularly disadvantaged, a perception by private investors and financial institutions of higher risk may work as a major innovation-inhibiting factor;\n",
        "30.Realises that innovative SMEs' access to risk capital is currently considerably limited, primarily in the first phases of their development; supports therefore the idea of using State aid to attract private capital investment to regional risk-capital funds working as public-private partnerships with higher flexibility of investment tranches for public resources;\n",
        "31.Calls for the further clarification of the legal status of intermediaries in regard to the scope of the services that they provide; supports the voucher system but proposes introducing an element of co-financing, in order to attract more private investment; believes, however, that the reimbursement of 100% might lead to the distortion of competition;\n",
        "32.Recommends that universities and their research centres should take part in regional public-private partnerships as 'innovation intermediaries', or cooperate with them closely; considers that this would create a large synergy effect with better interconnection between the research and innovation activities of universities and the needs of individual innovative SMEs and innovative business clusters;\n",
        "33.Asks for further clarification on how the State aid rules apply to universities and research establishments when they are engaged in economic activities;\n",
        "34.Questions the appropriateness of allowing State aid to SMEs for hiring highly qualified staff, since SMEs may have access to specialist knowledge and skills through the services of intermediaries and experts;\n",
        "35.Is convinced of the need to step up links between businesses and universities,inter aliaby increasing the mobility of highly qualified personnel of all specialities between universities and businesses, particularly SMEs; considers that aid, particularly via support schemes, should encourage such links; welcomes the Commission’s proposal to divide intellectual property rights between the partners (industry and public research organisations) in research and innovation programmes in accordance with each partner’s level of participation, considering that this will give a great boost to the creation of poles of excellence; calls, therefore, on the Commission to submit specific proposals to clarify the legal status of intellectual property in these circumstances;\n",
        "36.Believes that clusters originate in organic matter and therefore should be eligible for State aid only on a temporary basis, during the start-up phase, in order to meet administrative problems and obstacles linked with cooperation;\n",
        "37.Believes that State aid for infrastructure should fulfil the requirement of technical neutrality and open access, address identified market failures, and enhance innovative potential; * *       *\n",
        "38.Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
