{"speaker": "Marian Harkin,", "english": "Marian Harkin, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very comprehensive and well-argued report. I broadly support her position, although I am not sure that I would like to replace the term ‘market failure’ with ‘market inefficiency’. Market failure can and does occur; a case in point is that of peripheral regions where population is sometimes insufficient to support the market. While there may still be some inefficiencies in that market, it certainly does not reflect the whole picture.\nIn particular, I support the rapporteur where she asks that the Commission take into account state aid granted by the EU’s international competitors. I also support Amendment 9, which is in the same vein.\nThe state aid action plan says that we need to maintain a level playing field for all companies active in the single market. While this is in line with the Treaty, we do not live in a vacuum: outside influences and policies have an impact on Europe’s internal checks and balances. We must be able to respond to that challenge.\nOne concern I have about the Commission’s document is that it focuses strongly on aid for innovation by SMEs. We need to be careful that we do not discriminate against large firms because we could seriously hinder efforts in building networks and linkages of large multinational companies into EU innovation systems. We must be very vigilant that we do not encourage large firms to move their research and development and innovation activities outside the EU.\nI strongly support the suggestion that the EU should step up its efforts to meet the target of 3% of GDP investment in research and development. Indeed, I wish to express my disappointment that my own country, Ireland, has a much lower target.\nSecondly, I support using state aid to encourage innovative research into renewable energy technologies, in particular supplying equipment to process biomass, biofuels and so on. There is an opportunity and I believe we can be world leaders here.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very comprehensive and well-argued report.
