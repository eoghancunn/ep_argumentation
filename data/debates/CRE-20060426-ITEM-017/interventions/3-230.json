{"speaker": "David Casa (PPE-DE). –", "english": "David Casa (PPE-DE). – Mr President, discussions on state aid and its role in today’s economic activity have been going on for ages and must continue, not least now when our major economic competitors are stepping up their aid for innovation and research and development to create a more competitive environment. We are feeling the results of this here in Europe today. In order to close the gap between us and our global competitors, there needs to be an increase in public and private investment facilitation for our companies engaged in research and development, and there needs to be increased dissemination of results.\nThe points raised in the report by my colleague justify the very strong link between this lack of innovation and our inability to maintain the targets set in the Lisbon Strategy. One: we need to take the regulation further; two: we need investment in education and training; three: we need adequate infrastructure; four: we should facilitate access to risk capital.\nThese four points must be taken into serious consideration, not only as topics to discuss, but ones on which we must act urgently. With the US and Asia now exercising such authority in the innovation sector, we must act now. I would also like to stress the importance of SMEs within our economy and the difficulty that they face in investing in R&D. It is necessary that we provide them with the means to invest, not only by providing funds, but by providing, for example, incubator centres and forums where they can network, thus providing them with a means to stimulate growth.", "lang": "EN", "original": "David Casa (PPE-DE). – Mr President, discussions on state aid and its role in today’s economic activity have been going on for ages and must continue, not least now when our major economic competitors are stepping up their aid for innovation and research and development to create a more competitive environment.
