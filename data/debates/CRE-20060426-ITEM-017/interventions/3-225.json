{"speaker": "John Whittaker,", "english": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, this programme assumes that research and development activity can be improved by taking tax from individuals and businesses, then paying it back to businesses to be spent on research that would not be otherwise undertaken. Is there not something wrong here? If the research work would not otherwise be undertaken, then this is probably because the expected payoff from the research is too small to justify the expenditure. The EU deceives itself into thinking that it knows how to direct funding towards the right kind of innovation. It is more likely to direct the funding into waste and bureaucracy.\nI have a better plan: tax our businesses less and stop suffocating them with too much regulation and interference. Allow them to reap the profits from their good ideas, and I believe we would see an explosion of innovation. We would also see greater employment and economic growth: all the things this place says it wants to achieve but will never learn how to achieve.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Whittaker, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, this programme assumes that research and development activity can be improved by taking tax from individuals and businesses, then paying it back to businesses to be spent on research that would not be otherwise undertaken.
