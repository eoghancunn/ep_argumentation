{"speaker": "John Bowis,", "english": "John Bowis, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Doyle, the shadow rapporteur, let me thank our colleague, Mr Adamou, for his report. It is a positive report and it pushes all the right buttons: it talks about the Natura 2000 and the Birds and Habitats Directives; it talks about the effective implementation of REACH and water and pesticides legislation; it expresses the concern we all share over the financial constraints on Natura 2000 and other biodiversity actions.\nI also welcome what Commissioner Borg has said along these lines, and I particularly echo what has been said about the inaction of Member State governments in the European Union. Our target was 2010 – not ‘2010 and beyond’ – but we are nowhere near reaching our target of halting biodiversity loss by that year, which is not so far away.\nOn the way here, I read an article in The Times , which again referred to the loss of habitat, the use of pesticides and the introduction of alien species that we have heard so much about. This article was about birds – thousands of bird species under threat. Overall, 2 033 species are in danger; 86 % of the most threatened species are threatened because of the loss or deterioration of habitat due to factors such as dams, fishing, cattle numbers, etc.\nAlongside this is the issue of alien species, and Mrs Doyle, if she were here, would refer to the grey squirrel and the damage it has done to the red squirrels native to our continent, particularly in Britain but now in Italy and spreading north through France and Spain. We see the damage of the harlequin ladybird. We see the Chinese mitten crabs. They are there, they are damaging and they are dangerous not only to human health but also to the health of our environment and our natural native species.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Bowis, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Doyle, the shadow rapporteur, let me thank our colleague, Mr Adamou, for his report.
