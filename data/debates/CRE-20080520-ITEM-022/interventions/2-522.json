{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis,", "english": "Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, congratulations to Mr Blokland for his – as expected – excellent report and for the very good cooperation offered to all shadow rapporteurs.\nThe subject matter of this Green Paper is very important, as well as being deeply worrisome. Much of the dismantling of ships as presently done can rightly be characterised by many as criminal, both with reference to human health and also with reference to the environment.\nMost such dismantling, as we all know, takes place on beaches and river banks on the Indian subcontinent with no or minimal concern for the most basic rules of protection of humans and of the environment from contamination by a variety of toxic substances, including numerous carcinogenic agents.\nAdditionally, workers in such dismantling places are treated with the utmost disrespect for their human and labour rights and for their dignity, not to mention the use of child labour in truly atrocious conditions which, in some cases, differ little from child slavery in its most despicably shameful glory.\nA small number of amendments have been submitted, most with the support of the rapporteur. We shall follow his position, with the exception of Amendment 1, for which we can find no reasonable explanation why it does not meet with Mr Blokland’s approval and for which we shall vote positively, and we trust that others will do the same.\nIn giving our full support to this Green Paper let us hope that ship dismantling, regrettably a most necessary eventuality for the shipping industry, is done in the future in an environmentally, socially and hygienically safe manner and that it will provide a much needed but properly and safely earned income for the population of developing countries.\nLet us also hope that the ideas in this report are put into legislative form as soon as possible and that its scope is extended to include military as well as commercial vessels.\nFinally, let me say that I agree with previous speakers that our eventual aim should be a globally accepted strategy for ship dismantling.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, congratulations to Mr Blokland for his – as expected – excellent report and for the very good cooperation offered to all shadow rapporteurs.\nThe subject matter of this Green Paper is very important, as well as being deeply worrisome.
