    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Considers it ethically unacceptable to permit the humanly degrading and environmentally destructive conditions involved in the dismantling of ships to continue any longer,thereby accepting that the health of thousands of employees in the Far East is put at risk;\n",
        "2.  Recognises that the EU is partly responsible for the existing social and environmental problems in the field of ship dismantling; therefore calls for immediate, concrete action on the part of the EU, in co-operation with the IMO, to stop the practice of social and environmental dumping that stems from economic incentives and to reach a globally sustainable solution;\n",
        "3.  Although some degree of child labour for the lighter work is common, considers it ethically unacceptable that children are used by some dismantling contractors to do hard and hazardous work and that such children are not provided with sufficient educational and recreational facilities;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the thorough analysis in the Green Paper of the principal social and environmental problems arising from operations involved in the dismantling of ships in Southern Asian countries; however, stresses that this initiative is at least ten years overdue;\n",
        "5.   Welcomes the Green Paper's comprehensive analysis of the major social and environmental problems caused by ship dismantling activities in Southern Asian countries;\n",
        "6.  Considers that practical measures must be taken quickly at European and international level, the main aim being to protect the environment and public health without simply displacing the problems to other countries; the most effective way of achieving that aim is to adopt and implement an international agreement laying down obligations incumbent upon all the parties involved in the process of dismantling ships;\n",
        "7.  Considers that the dismantling of ships will continue to have a social and ecological impact even in the longer term, particularly beacause the number of ships under construction has been increasing for years; stresses therefore the continuing importance of European innovation and development in the shipbuilding industry in order to improve ships and make them less environmentally damaging; calls on the Commission therefore to proceed wholeheartedly with the LeaderSHIP 2015 programme;\n",
        "8.  Stresses that there is little time to spare, as it is predicted that in 2010 nearly 800 single-hull tankers will have to be dismantled[3]; notes that a future convention of the IMO will address the issue but is not likely to enter into force before 2012;\n",
        "9.  Calls upon the Commission to draft the requisite guidelines and mechanisms  in the sense that every ship due to be scrapped and which does not fulfil all the requirements of  international conventions, and consequently does not have valid certification issued by EU-recognised registers, to be regarded as 'waste', pursuant to the definition in Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste[4], in order to prevent evasion of the provisions of the Waste Shipments Regulation, and to ensure the smooth and safe withdrawal from the market of those ships which have reached the limit of their operational 'life';\n",
        "10. Stresses that the preamble to the Waste Shipments Regulation states that 'It is necessary to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of ship dismantling in order to protect human health and the environment'; emphasises that this is a core issue which should be strictly adhered to by all concerned.\n",
        "11. Supports initiatives at international level to achieve binding minimum standards on ship recycling and promote the establishment of clean recycling facilities with due consideration for working conditions and the associated health and safety issues, especially in the scrap yards of Southern Asia, so as to protect workers and the environment from the adverse impacts of hazardous waste and dangerous working practices;\n",
        "12. Calls upon the Commission to compile and maintain a list of seagoing ships which are likely to be scrapped within a few years and to envisage mechanisms whereby such ships are considered as 'pre-waste ships' for which a disposal plan needs to be drawn up prior to selling for scrapping; calls on the Member States and port authorities, which must have the power to identify 'end-of-life' ships, to use this list to step up their monitoring of those ships, which could potentially be scrapped. considers that, in this connection, speedy adoption of the proposed revision of the Directive on port state control[5]would be desirable;\n",
        "13. Calls upon the Commission and Member States to negotiate an IMO convention that incorporates extensive requirements and regulations which:\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission to consider possible measures to reduce the potential financial implications of ship dismantling by setting more stringent production standards, such as a restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission to negotiate within the IMO with a view to standardising the materials used in the building and fitting-out of vessels and to tightening up the environmental requirements relating thereto;\n",
        "16. Strongly recommends that EU efforts aim at safeguarding minimum standards ensuring the highest environmental, health and safety protection and comprising in particular regulations for the design and construction of ships, their operation, the preparation of ships for recycling, the operation of ship recycling facilities and the establishment of an appropriate enforcement mechanism for ship recycling, incorporating certification and reporting requirements;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to implement as a matter of urgency a reliable system of checks on the application of the Basel Convention on ships destined for scrapping;\n",
        "18. Considers that monitoring of the implementation of the future IMO convention should be just as stringent as in the case of the Basel Convention: all relevant standards of the ILO must be incorporated in the instrument, no exceptions may be permitted, serious deficiencies in the interpretation and enforcement of the existing regulatory framework must be eliminated and measures must be taken to prevent end-of-life ships which contain hazardous waste from departing for countries with inadequate installations and which are not contracting parties to that convention;\n",
        "19. Emphasises the need to reinforce the actions taken by the Commission and the Member States, at EU and international level, aimed at safeguarding the minimum standards that ensure the highest levels of environmental, health and safety protection and at adherence to the principle enshrined in Articles 34 and 36 of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste[6]('the Basel Ban Amendment'), which is to ban the export of hazardous wastes to developing countries; to this end calls on the Commission to propose a regulation on the design and construction of ships, their operation throughout their life-cycle and their preparation for recycling, the operation of ship recycling facilities and the establishment of an appropriate enforcement mechanism for ship recycling, incorporating certification and reporting requirements;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to take into consideration the decisions of the forthcoming third session of the Joint ILO/IMO/BC (Basel Convention) Working Group on Ship Scrapping on joint technical cooperation activities and a coordinated approach to interim measures to be taken pending entry into force of the new IMO Convention on ship recycling;\n",
        "21. Urges that immediate measures be taken to support the development of a competitive and clean ship dismantling and remediation (pre-cleaning) industry in the EU; urges the Member States in this connection to require pre-cleaning and clean recycling of all ships which are State property, including warships, and to dismantle them in a safe and environmentally sound manner in EU facilities which should be carried out throughpublic tenders with strict public procurement rules in full respect of Regulation(EC) No 1013/2006; considers moreover that the development of recycling activities at European shipyards should be supported as part of EU industrial, structural and cohesion policy;\n",
        "22. Takes the view that all vessels flying the flag of a Member State and all ships that call at EU ports should be obliged to carry lists of the materials and products used in their building and fitting-out;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to develop a list of preferred ship recycling facilities which comply with recognised international human rights and health and safety standards; welcomes the suggestion by the Commission that certification and labelling systems should be established for safe and clean recycling facilities and considers that Community subsidies should be granted to the shipping industry only on condition that  they adhere to the Waste Shipments Regulation and to other EU requirements, such as the use of certified and regularly audited facilities ; stresses that it cannot be the intention to destroy the ship dismantling market in Southern Asia but that on the contrary the aim should be to preserve it by promoting environmentally sound dismantling;\n",
        "24. Considers that the EU needs to lead the way and encourage global action, with a clear objective of gradually ending the current practices of ship dismantling in Southern Asia, and move towards the adoption and implementation of an international convention setting environmental and social standards for all parties involved;\n",
        "25. Calls for a global strategy which ensures that ship recycling is carried out in such a way that all those involved in the process (including shipowners, recycling/scrapping facilities, the flag state of the ship, the state in which the ship's recycling will take place) are coordinated and assume their due share of responsibility;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to propose specific measures to promote the transfer of know-how and technology in order to help dismantling yards in Southern Asia to comply with international safety and environmental requirements; considers that this aim should also be taken into account in the wider framework of the EU's development aid policy for these countries; considers that, in this context, use should also be made of the possible expertise of trade unions and nongovernmental organisations;\n",
        "27. Welcomes the results already obtained by the SHIPDISMANTL project funded by the Framework Programme for Research and Development, under which support systems are being developed that will be made available free of charge to the ship-breaking industry worldwide; is convinced that further improvements will be possible as a result of new calls for proposals which specifically concentrate on end-of-life strategies for vessels;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to further study and carefully evaluate the benefits of enhanced financial co-operation with and direct investment in selected Southern Asian dismantling sites, and thereby assist in forming a network of certified, EU-approved dismantling sites that may generate greater returns on investment in economic, environmental and social terms.\n",
        "29. Considers that the polluter pays principle and the principle of producer liability should be applied extensively and effectively in order to attain a lasting solution to this problem;\n",
        "30. Takes the view that the ship's operator/owner is always responsible for any harmful effects of the dismantling on workers, public health or the environment, regardless of where the dismantling takes place (whether inside or outside the EU);\n",
        "31. Believes that efforts must be made by the Member States and the Commission to create a mandatory ship recycling fund jointly funded by shipyards and shipowners (for example by means of taxes levied on new ships, port fees and annual taxes linked to IMO registration) and with shared responsibility, which would facilitate the pre-cleaning of vessels of hazardous materials and the development of ship recycling yards in the Union;\n",
        "32. Welcomes the proposal to establish a fund for ship dismantling and calls upon the Commission and Member States to pursue with determination the aim of establishing such a fund simultaneously at IMO and EU levels; calls on the Commission in this connection also to investigate the financial mechanism available, including a compulsory insurance requirement and the use of port fees, in order to ensure environmentally sound recycling from the moment when a ship first starts to operate, bearing in mind that a vessel may have more than one owner in the course of its useful life;\n",
        "33. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the governments of Turkey, Bangladesh, China, Pakistan and India, and the IMO.\n"
