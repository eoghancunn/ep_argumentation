In fact, I believe that the European Union, together with the United Nations, should continue to work to build peace and reconciliation on the island of Cyprus.\nHowever, Turkey too has serious obligations. For example, Turkey must open its ports and airports to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes. This is an obligation that Turkey will have to honour in accordance with the accession negotiations. I also feel that Turkey must consider repealing clause 301 of its Penal Code, which is being used to charge dozens of Turkish writers with insulting Turkishness.\nIt is clear that significant efforts are needed in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey. These are serious issues. In conclusion, I must stress that they have to be effectively addressed by the Turkish Government sooner rather than later, because these policy matters are an intrinsic element of accession negotiations.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Seán Ó Neachtain (UEN). – Mr President, let me say at the outset that, as a member of the European Parliament’s High Level Contact Group for relations with Northern Cyprus, I am clearly aware of the sense of isolation the Turkish Cypriots feel in light of the rejection of the Annan Plan.
