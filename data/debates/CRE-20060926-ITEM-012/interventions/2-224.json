But the Turks should think about the impact on their own society.\nOnly yesterday, the Turkish Army Chief of Staff, General İlker Başbuğ, warned of the dangers posed by Islamist extremists politicising religion, and pledged that the Turkish army would protect the secular nature of the Turkish Republic. But in the past the Turks have not had to contend with the European Union. They may find that their Islamist extremists are able to exploit the EU’s non-discrimination, equality and human rights legislation to their advantage.
