{"speaker": "Paula Lehtomäki,", "english": "Paula Lehtomäki, President-in-Office of the Council . (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this thorough and commendable debate has very clearly brought up the challenges and problems associated with Turkey’s accession negotiations. In addition, however, Turkey’s immensely important strategic role for the European Union has been made clear.\nIn our role as the country holding the presidency, we will promote the talks on membership in accordance with the general principles of enlargement. These include the uniform treatment of applicant countries and progress based on their own merits. It is worth saying once again that the European Council confirmed in summer 2006 that it would adhere to existing commitments regarding enlargement, and the work continues on this basis. There are many challenges facing Turkey, but obviously the talks on membership support the continuation of Turkey’s reform process, and that is in the interests of everyone.\nOne of the key issues is that Turkey should ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. At present we are working hard to find a solution which on the one hand would allow direct trade between the European Union and North Cyprus, and on the other would ensure that Turkey also opened its ports to Cypriot vessels.\nAt the same time as the accession negotiations are taking place, it is also important to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus question within the framework of the United Nations.\nMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this worthy, dynamic debate.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Paula Lehtomäki, President-in-Office of the Council .
