{"speaker": "Arūnas Degutis (ALDE). –", "english": "Arūnas Degutis (ALDE). – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a comprehensive report. In supporting him, I would like to underline that coordinated deployment of the European Rail Track Management System, a strategic part of the Trans-European Network, should be applied uniformly to all European rail infrastructures.\nAn effective signalling system with automatic speed control will help to avoid lethal accidents and will further improve the safety level of rail transport. Implementation of the ERTMS will provide increased security by ensuring continuous monitoring during train operations. It will also ease the strain on the roads and shift transport flows to the railways.\nThe ERTMS is superior to national systems because it is cheaper as far as new acquisitions and maintenance are concerned and safer at all speeds. I agree that the old systems and the ERTMS should not exist side by side for too long. The transition to the new system should be as quick as possible. The 20 different train protection and signalling systems that still exist today should be replaced by a single system in all EU Member States in the near future.\nThe sooner trains are equipped with European train control systems, thus allowing them to travel on major interoperable corridors, the sooner it will be possible to make savings on maintenance costs and eliminate costs associated with the use of multiple systems.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Arūnas Degutis (ALDE). – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a comprehensive report.
