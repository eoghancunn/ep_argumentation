    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Stresses the need for a common approach to better regulation, based on a core set of regulatory principles, namely subsidiarity, proportionality, accountability, consistency, transparency and targeting; stresses that this approach cannot bypass the rights of social consultation and must respect the principles of participative democracy;\n",
        "2.   Stresses the need for Parliament, Council and the Commission to establish 'better regulation' task forces, to set up an inter-institutional working group to develop training, skills and quality control and to share and benchmark better regulation best practice;\n",
        "3.   Urges the Commission to produce a short, clear guide to the better regulation process, outlining the key appraisal steps that should take place in the evolution, development and implementation of EU legislation; suggests that the guide should also summarise the better regulation principles to be followed by all parties in the legislative process;\n",
        "4.   Insists that all Commission proposals be accompanied by a ‘Better Regulation Check List’ summarising the steps through which the proposal should proceed, and that this check list should be updated as each stage is completed, with cross-references to any relevant studies or impact assessments;\n",
        "5.   Emphasises that a strategic regulatory approach and stable framework will produce optimal results by enabling the affected sectors to plan and implement legislation in the most effective way; commends the Commission for the CARS 21 initiative, which is a good example of a strategic approach to regulation;\n",
        "6.   Requests that the Commission carry out bothex-anteandex-postimpact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been met and to assist with the regulatory review process;\n",
        "7.Calls onthe Commission to set up an independent audit body to structure and guarantee the quality and independence of economic impact assessments of EU legislation;\n",
        "8.   Considers it essential, in the interests of the uniform application by the Commission of impact assessments, that their quality be submitted to a dedicated quality control function within the Commission; stresses that it will not consider proposals without their being accompanied by a quality impact assessment;\n",
        "9.   Believes that impact assessments should undergo a mandatory peer-review process and that Parliament must be involved in the nomination and selection of peer-review panels and in the setting of evaluation requirements;\n",
        "10. Insists that all legislative proposals forwarded to Parliament include an executive summary of the impact assessment;\n",
        "11.Stresses that Member States must ensure that they are notcausingnewimplementation problemsby imposing additional requirements at national levelwhen transposing Community legislation(‘gold-plating’), and confirm this by means of a formal declaration to the Commission;\n",
        "12. Insists that the Commission must continue to consolidate, simplify and codify\n",
        "13. Requests that the Commission come forward with new proposals for more transparent and effective stakeholder consultation; takes the view that the partners in the social dialogue must be involved in this on an equal footing and that consumer and environmental organisations must be consulted;\n",
        "14. Urges the Commission to improve the effectiveness of the preventive scrutiny of national draft technical regulations under Directive 98/34/EC on the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations,inter aliaby increasing public access to objections raised by the Commission and other Member States;\n",
        "15. Insists that the Commission establish a transparent fast-track infringement procedure for internal market test cases and that it inform Parliament on how its priority criteria for infringement handling, as announced in its communication on better monitoring of the application of Community law (COM(2002)0725), are in practice screened and brought to the attention of complainants;\n",
        "16. Urges the Council and the Commission to improve monitoring of the implementation of and compliance with European law; is of the opinion that this is likely  to assist in improving transposition rates and the sharing of best practice between the Member States, as well as in introducing sanctions for non-compliance; insists that the Commission’s reports on implementation must not be confined to a legal analysis of the implementing instruments but must also evaluate the application of the directive in practice;\n",
        "17. Insists that Parliament be provided with a list of policy measures in which the Commission has used alternative regulation mechanisms that includes an evaluation of the failure or success of such measures, their impact on the situation in practice – and more specifically on employees’ and consumers’ rights, social cohesion, fair competition, the stimulation of growth and the EU’s competitive position – and on best practice, and lessons learned from the process; insists that this information be incorporated in the Commission annual report on better law-making;\n",
        "18. Recognises that the classic method of regulation is not always the appropriate way to achieve a policy objective;\n",
        "19. Insists on the central role of Parliament, and particularly of the rapporteur responsible, in monitoring Member States’ implementation of and compliance with European law and the supervision thereof by the Commission;\n",
        "20. Insists that, in the Annual Work Programme, the Commission provide a list of those proposals which may be the subject of alternative regulation;\n",
        "21. Insists that alternative regulatory proposals include clear objectives and defined deadlines for action, as well as sanctions for non-compliance;\n",
        "22. Proposes that Parliament's Committees set up robust review mechanisms to evaluate and monitor the implementation and use of alternative forms of regulation with a view to ensuring legal redress for consumers where operators fail to meet their commitments under such alternative regulatory proposals;\n",
        "23. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
