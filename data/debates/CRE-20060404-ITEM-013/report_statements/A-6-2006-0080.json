    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Strongly supports the process of simplification of the Union's regulatory environment, as well as the objective to ensure that the regulatory environment is necessary, simple and effective; stresses, however, that such a process shall be based on a number of preconditions: i)   full involvement of the European Parliament both in the interinstitutional debate on simplification and as co-legislator in the adoption of the legislation subject to the \"simplification process\"; ii)  wide and transparent consultation of all relevant stakeholders, thus including not only Member States and business but also non-governmental organisations; iii)  strengthening of the general transparency of the regulatory process, in particular by opening Council discussions to public scrutiny when the Council is acting in its legislative capacity;\n",
        "2.  Encourages the Commission to adopt, under the aegis of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making, specifically targeted and well thought-out legislation whose effects can be foreseen, and which will contribute to establishing favourable conditions for boosting growth and employment by reducing unnecessary administrative costs and procedures, eliminating obstacles to adaptability and innovation and generally ensuring legal certainty;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the Commission communication on simplification of the regulatory environment, the commitment to submitting a programme to simplify legislative acts, and the methods and targets laid down for translating that programme into reality;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the fact that the Commission intends to include major simplification initiatives in its annual legislative programmes and the announcement that the Commission will submit additional communications to cover the different sectors of the Community economy; stresses the importance of close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission for the purpose of identifying the legislation which should be simplified;\n",
        "5.  Welcomes the intention to reduce unnecessary burden on SMEs and to reinforce the use of information technology; considers that one of the objectives of simplifying the Union's regulatory environment should be to make legislation simpler and more effective, and thus more \"user-oriented\";\n",
        "6.  Considers that the simplification process shall under no circumstance entail lowering the standards contained in current legislation;\n",
        "7.  Notes that the success rate of the simplification initiatives undertaken since 2003 is not disappointing and that the average length of procedures is not excessive given the complexity of the subject matter; records, nevertheless, that the number of simplification initiatives launched since that date has been very limited and that the targets originally set for reducing the volume of the Community ‘acquis’ are far from being achieved;\n",
        "8.  Takes the view that the repeal of irrelevant and obsolete acts is a priority requirement with which the Commission must comply without delay; considers, however, that when Community legislation is repealed on those grounds, a Community act must be put in place at the same time to prevent Member States regulating matters that have been deregulated at Community level;\n",
        "9.  Points out that, while there may be over-regulation in some areas, this state of affairs is due in large measure to the lawmaking activity of the Member States and that, therefore, if Community legislation is to be repealed, this must be followed by repeal of the matching national provisions;\n",
        "10. Proposes that the Commission constantly monitor such national legislation as might remain in force after the Community legislation that gave rise to it has been repealed; considers that the Commission should add appropriate review clauses to its proposals;\n",
        "11. Considers codification and recasting to be the primary means of simplifying theacquis communautaireand urges that they be used more widely; believes that recasting has been used only to a limited extent and that this is due to both lack of interest on the part of the Commission anda failure to gear Parliament’s Rules of Procedure closely enough to the Interinstitutional Agreement;\n",
        "12. Applauds the results achieved so far through codification of Community legislation and hopes that the Commission units concerned will draw up new, and more ambitious, codification proposals extending also to sectors other than those covered to date, in particular company law, intellectual property, and consumer protection; 13 Considers that if the institutions genuinely wish to simplify legislation and employ recasting to that end, the Interinstitutional Agreement on recasting should be applied more systematically;\n",
        "14. Understands that, if the intention is to make recasting effective, Parliament and the Council will, as a matter of principle, have to refrain from amending the codified parts of acts; believes that, if the institutions genuinely wish to simplify legislation and employ recasting to that end, the codified parts of an act should, as a rule, be subject to the provisions laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on codification; recognises, however, that there should be a special procedure to enable the codified part to be amended whenever this is essential in order to make it consistent with, or link it to, the part that can be altered;\n",
        "15. Considers that the institutions might usefully determine whether a third type of operation might be provided for, alongside codification and recasting, so as to afford the most appropriate means of simplifying Community legal acts; considers, however, that to date, in those cases in which the Commission has drawn up generic simplification proposals which cannot be classified as involving repeal, codification or recasting, the European Parliament cannot embark on any procedure other than the customary one and therefore, in such cases, point 36 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making of 16 December 2003 cannot be applied;\n",
        "16. Considers that the Interinstitutional Agreement on recasting should spell out the procedure to follow in cases where, during a legislative procedure, it proves necessary to alter the codified parts of the act;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission, taking into account the guidelines set out above, to submit a proposal without delay with a view to recasting the interinstitutional agreements governing the quality of Union legislation;\n",
        "18. Is ready to make a larger contribution to the work that needs to be done jointly by the three institutions to relaunch the simplification process;\n",
        "19. Undertakes for its part to give thought to the improvement of its procedures and its internal legislative techniques in order to speed up the simplification dossiers, while complying with the procedures laid down in primary law, in this particular case the Treaty establishing the European Community;\n",
        "20. Instructs the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to determine what amendments might be made to the Rules of Procedure to enable the agreement on recasting to be actually implemented, not least with a view to making greater use of the simplified procedures laid down in the Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "21. Supports the practices of co-regulation and self-regulation, but points out that the Commission has to lay down the conditions and limits which the parties must observe when employing the above practices and that these should in any event be used under Commission supervision and without prejudice to Parliament’s right to object to their use;\n",
        "22. Is surprised that the issue of reforming the current system of delegating rule-making (‘comitology’) receives only a brief mention in passing[7]in the above Commission communication, even though such a reform could make a major contribution to simplifying secondary Community law by allowing the Commission to adopt implementing provisions using faster procedures;\n",
        "23. Is of the opinion that the legislature could also contribute to simplification through agreement on less detailed legal acts and the use of a wider range of implementing measures by the Commission, provided that effective control by the legislator as to the substance of those implementing measures is guaranteed;\n",
        "24. Takes note of the list of actions contained in the Commission simplification rolling programme and will actively cooperate in the achievement of the objective of simplifying those pieces of legislation, if appropriate, in the context of the forthcoming legislative process;\n",
        "25. Expects that the various recasting and review proposals from the Commission will contribute to improving the Union’s level of economic and social development in the context of the sustainable development policy, as well as the level of citizens’ health protection and the quality of their environment, in conformity with the objectives laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty;\n",
        "26. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
