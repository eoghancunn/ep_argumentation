        "1.  Stresses that development policy is entirely part of the acquis communautaire and recalls the new Member States' international commitments in this field; underlines that the EU needs to support the new Member States so as to assist them in integrating the acquis communautaire;\n",
        "2.  Considers that the new Member States signed the European Consensus on Development in the year of enlargement in 2004, agreeing to implement an ambitious development paradigm and to work towards achieving the MDGs within the set time-frame;\n",
        "3.  Expresses its concern that many of the new Member States are not on course to meet the target of 0.17% of GNI to be spent on ODA by 2010, but some may see ODA fall in line with overall budget cuts due to the need to reduce government debt;\n",
        "4.  Stresses the experience of the new Member States, in particular during the transition process, and considers that good governance and the promotion of democracy must be the priorities in development cooperation matters for the EU; calls on the EU institutions to put to good use, in order to enrich its development policy, the experience accumulated in the field by the new Member States;\n",
        "5.  Considers that, due to an active cooperation policy, the new Member States will contribute to the promotion of respect for fundamental rights and solidarity with the new generations in third countries within the scope of the ENP,\n",
        "6.  Stresses the concrete benefit for the new Member States of participating in development cooperation policy, in particular in the areas of economic development and trade;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the Commission's new approach of going beyond traditional development policies and creating new partnership relations with developing countries;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes the fact that the international community is willing to accept the principle of 'common responsibility' in the case of humanitarian urgency;\n",
        "9.  Suggests that the new and old Member States should work together more proactively within the EU to ensure that the situation in particular countries included in the ENP is monitored in a more timely fashion so that the EU can react with greater flexibility in its policy towards these countries;\n",
        "10. Stresses the link between development and migration, which is a major challenge for most of the new Member States which are at the external borders of the EU;\n",
        "11. Recognises the progress made by the new Member States in their evolution from being aid recipient countries to becoming donor countries, and acknowledges the challenges that lie ahead;\n",
        "12. Notes that the priorities of the new Member States after the transition period are determined by their historical relations and lie with their neighbours, and that the major part of the development cooperation budget of the new Member States targets their immediate neighbours and the CIS countries; calls on the EU to seize the occasion of the accession of the new Member States to reinforce its strategic presence in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Caucasus as regions of the world hitherto less concerned by European aid but which are nonetheless facing numerous development challenges;\n",
        "13. Stresses that effective action in the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, key fields of intervention for the new Member States, is also a means of acting in the long term for poverty reduction, which is a priority objective of EU development policy as fixed by the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI);\n",
        "14. Recalls the Eastern dimension of EU external relations and considers that a new assembly of EU and neighbouring countries (similar to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Euromed) and the Parliamentary Assembly for EU-Latin America (Eurolat)) could build on historic experience, boost the input of the new Member States in EU politics and help to co-shape the ENP and to make neighbour countries aware of new political fields;\n",
        "15. Recognises that most Member States have departments within their Ministries of Foreign Affairs dealing specifically with development cooperation, but nonetheless recommends that they strengthen coordination both within their own ministries and between each other and with other Member States to the extent approved by national parliaments and local authorities in the decision-making process;\n",
        "16. Recognises that building the relevant institutions and implementing policies is a time-consuming process;\n",
        "17. Recognises that the biggest challenges for the new Member States in the coming years will be the increase in budgets and awareness-raising activities;\n",
        "18. Welcomes the above-mentioned 'European Consensus on Development: The Contribution of Development Education and Awareness Raising' and stresses that Parliament has an important role to play in highlighting the actual and potential role of development education and awareness in both formal and informal education in the new Member States;\n",
        "19. Considers that long-term projects which target partners and sectors where the new Member States have a comparative advantage and can transfer experience are of optimal utility in the global poverty eradication process; 20 Calls for a division of labour between the Member States with regard to the added-value of each actor's input and with the objective of working together effectively;\n",
        "21. Believes that a large majority of the new Member States could give greater priority to their development policy and furthermore ensure an approach to strategy planning with greater internal coordination (with the exception of Lithuania, where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the lead ministry for ODA planning and management);\n",
        "22. States that the objective of the EU with regard to the new Member States is not only to capitalise on their experience but also to help them strengthen their role as new donors; encourages, therefore, the old and new Member States to decide jointly on a realistic calendar with a view to bringing the new Member States into line with the EU's development aid objectives, while taking due account of both the potential and the limits of the partnership between new and old Member States;\n",
        "23. Stresses that the new Member States need to be fully included in the sharing of experience and in specific training in fields related to the programming, implementation and evaluation of development cooperation policy; recalls the different CBS (Capacity Building Scheme) experiences and calls for further improvements, to stop for instance the turnover of civil servants;\n",
        "24. Recalls the importance of a permanent dialogue with officials responsible for the new Member States and acceding or candidate countries; underlines the importance of EuropeAid's technical assistance in the organisation of training courses, seminars, conferences and specific technical assistance to meet the needs expressed by these countries; stresses the importance of the activities funded by the Development Directorate-General in this regard;\n",
        "25. Regrets the fact that the special working party on strengthening the new Member States' capacities held no further meetings in 2007, even though the new Member States have a pressing need to increase their development-cooperation capacities and the EU enlargement process is still under way;\n",
        "26. Calls for that working party to be reactivated and for it to be ensured that representatives of the European Parliament's Committee on Development (or its secretariat) and of TRIALOG (a project conducted in close cooperation with European development NGOs) are also involved in the working party's activities, and that the working party's remit is enlarged to include the new Member States' specific development-cooperation problems;\n",
        "27. Stresses the importance of projects on \"twinning\" and \"light twinning\" in training the personnel of new Member States through quality technical assistance, funds which only Hungary and Slovakia have called for;\n",
        "28. Calls for bi-annual inter-parliamentary meetings between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the new Member States focused on development and cooperation issues and the creation of a specific network in this regard;\n",
        "29. Believes that the participation of the new Member States in the European Development Fund committee would bring an additional dimension to the debates and further help to build their technical capacities;\n",
        "30. Notes the lack of public recognition of development cooperation priorities in some of the new Member States and calls for an overall communication and education strategy to remedy this deficit; stresses the importance of raising awareness of development issues in school curricula, as well as the role of the media in creating public awareness and developing an international volunteer tradition;\n",
        "31. Takes a positive view on the importanceof a report on development education awareness raising and its role in the implementation of the European Consensus on Development, highlighting the actual and potential role of development education and awareness raising in formal and informal education in Europe, especially in the new Member States;\n",
        "32. Considers that the public in the new Member States is already aware of humanitarian aid issues, as was demonstrated by their large-scale mobilisation over the 2004 tsunami - a starting-point for making people aware of the need for specific longer-term commitments within an effective development policy;\n",
        "33. Calls on the Commission to launch a specific awareness-raising campaign focusing on the comparative advantages and added value of the new Member States with regard to cooperation and development issues;\n",
        "34. Calls for greater coordination among the relevant national stakeholders and an appropriate involvement on the part of NGOs and local authorities in national policy-making processes;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission to actively involve the new Member States in the preparation and negotiation of Action Plans, and in monitoring their implementation;\n",
        "36. Notes that, by fully untying their development aid, the new Member States could be a positive example for all Member States;\n",
        "37. Notes that all Member States should set deadlines to untie their development aid, since in the long term tied development aid neither serves good governance nor the efficient allocation of resources, and does not contribute to the goals of development cooperation; 38 Notes that the links between the private sector and development cooperation constitute a promising new avenue for the new Member States, and that a more active participation on the part of private undertakings from those Member States in the procurement of development cooperation projects at EU level could raise awareness of development cooperation; ° °         °\n",
        "39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
