This is totally unacceptable practice. The international community must work in a more concerted manner to ensure that international codes of practice to combat child labour are rigorously enforced in all countries round the world.\nThis must be a key issue in the context of EU development aid policies at all times. The EU must work more closely with the United Nations, UNICEF, the World Bank, the International Labour Organisation, donors and NGOs to introduce the correct strategies to ensure that uniform laws are in place to stop this inhumane practice of child labour.\nA multidimensional approach is needed if child labour is to be effectively tackled around the world. Enforced social protection measures and changes to the labour market rules are needed. Child labour and education issues are inextricably linked. Children denied access to education are more likely to be engaged in child labour. The European Union, as the largest donor in the world of development aid, must continue to work aggressively to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are met by 2015, including the targets set by the international community relating to availability of education to all children in the world.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Liam Aylward (UEN). – Mr President, it is amazing that 200 million children around the world can be described as child labourers.
