{"speaker": "Toomas Savi,", "english": "Toomas Savi, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, on Tuesday the President of the Republic of Estonia, Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves, said that we should cast aside the term ‘new Member States’. That is also part of the title of Ms Budreikaitė’s report. Although I agree in principle with my President, the term has a positive connotation as well, involving innovation and readiness for reforms. Today’s report gives a comprehensive overview of the progress that the new donor countries in the European Union – that were the recipients of similar help a decade ago – have made in the field of development cooperation, pointing out both the shortcomings and the potential for further increase in the contribution to the EU development cooperation policy.\nIn 1970 the United Nations agreed upon the target of 0.7% of GDP for development assistance to eradicate extreme poverty – the most humiliating state for human beings. Dear colleagues, do not forget that this concerns approximately one third of the world’s population. Unfortunately, the efforts made so far are clearly not enough. No new Member State has reached the target. The same applies to the old Member States, with the exception of Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. Norway, although not a member of the EU, has also achieved the same goal.\nI would like to thank Ms Budreikaitė for the extensive work that she has done in compiling the draft report and accommodating the amendments made by me and my colleagues on the Committee on Development. The rapporteur has been elected from a new donor country and her report will definitely be studied in great detail in those countries, including Estonia.\nFinally, the European Consensus on Development is committed to a further increase of the designated funds and I encourage all the Member States to take it seriously. This report is a praiseworthy document that once again reminds us of our commitments, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Toomas Savi, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, on Tuesday the President of the Republic of Estonia, Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves, said that we should cast aside the term ‘new Member States’.
