    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations on amending the Cotonou Agreement, but regrets that the agreement reached at the Brussels summit of 15 and 16 December 2005 bringing the amount allocated to the 10th EDF (2008-2013) to EUR 22 682 million remains short of the initial proposals aimed at maintaining the same level of aid as under the ninth EDF;\n",
        "2.  Emphasises that the simple wording used in Annex Ia to the Cotonou Agreement is open to different interpretations with regard to determining the amount of the multiannual financial framework of ACP-EU cooperation and that, in any event, this amount must reflect the major political commitments made by the EU in 2005 on development and aid to Africa;\n",
        "3.  Supports the request of the ACP-EU JPA, expressed at its 9th session in April 2005 in Bamako (Mali) that a suitable proportion of EDF appropriations should be used for the political education and training of parliamentarians and of political, economic and social leaders, in the interests of a lasting strengthening of good governance, the rule of law, democratic structures, and the interaction between government and opposition in pluralistic democracies based on free elections; these funds should be used for the establishment of public administration colleges and the political education of members of parliament, local administrators and people in positions of responsibility in political parties and associations;\n",
        "4.  Calls on the JPA to continue its work on human rights and thereby contribute to the political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, if appropriate by organising public hearings; calls for greater involvement of civil society in the work of the JPA and its standing committees;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the JPA, and in particular its Committee on Political Affairs, to strengthen its role as a forum for political dialogue, in accordance with Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, and the role of parliamentarians in the ACP countries, and to continue its efforts towards reinforcing parliamentary democracy in the ACP countries, particularly by identifying and sharing good practice on parliamentary scrutiny of the executive;\n",
        "6.  Calls for greater transparency with regard to the progress and the substance of the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements as well as delivery of substantial assistance in line with President Barroso’s commitment to provide EUR 1 billion in ‘aid for trade’ in Gleneagles, and in addition for greater involvement of the ACP-EU JPA in the negotiations, as well as of the European Parliament, national parliaments, local government and civil society;\n",
        "7.  Notes that the standing committees are now working at a normal pace, that their creation in 2003 opened up new opportunities for debate and dialogue and that the ACP and European parliamentarians have thereby not only become better acquainted with each other, but have also learnt to cooperate on fundamental subjects with a view to reaching common positions during plenary sessions, wherever possible;\n",
        "8.  Applauds the work of the Bureau and of its vice-presidents, particularly as regards the reports on human rights and on the financing of regional and subregional meetings (Article 17(3) of the Cotonou Agreement and Article 6 of the Rules of Procedure); calls for clarification of the duties of the vice-presidents with responsibility for budgetary affairs in order to increase transparency in the use of the operating expenditure of the JPA and supervision of these funds by the Bureau;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the JPA to take action in response to the message from the UN Secretary‑General, Mr Kofi Annan, on the occasion of the ninth session of the JPA in Bamako, according to whom ‘it is not in the United Nations that the Millennium Development Goals will be achieved. They have to be achieved in each of its Member States, by the joint efforts of their governments and people’;\n",
        "10. Emphasises that the question of sugar reform gave rise to serious concerns at the Edinburgh summit; a letter to this end from the two Co‑Presidents of the JPA was sent to the Council on 23 November 2005 calling for the sugar reform to be just and fair for all;\n",
        "11. Notes that the EU package of compensation and restructuring measures for the EU sugar industry exceeds EUR 7 billion and urges that the 18 ACP signatories to the Sugar Protocol, many of whose economies depend almost entirely on sugar, receive timely and substantial financial support, which must be additional to existing commitments;\n",
        "12. Calls on the JPA to make the Committee on Political Affairs a genuine forum for conflict prevention and resolution within the ACP-EU partnership framework;\n",
        "13. Emphasises the role played by the Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment in response to natural disasters, and hopes that the JPA can contribute to prevention and aid in the event of a natural disaster in the ACP countries;\n",
        "14. Emphasises the support expressed by the Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade for maintaining specific development aid for ACP countries and its contribution of points for discussion on improving the future management of the EDF;\n",
        "15. Underlines the importance of the personal involvement of parliamentarians within the JPA and applauds the efforts made in this direction;\n",
        "16. Considers that holding the JPA session by rotation in EU Member States provides real ‘added value’ and calls for this rotation to be continued in the future;\n",
        "17. Welcomes the participation of representatives of the European Parliament and of the JPA in the informal council of development cooperation ministers organised by the UK Presidency of the Council of the European Union in Leeds on 24 and 25 October 2005, and expresses the hope that future presidencies of the Council of the European Union do the same;\n",
        "18. Notes with satisfaction the decision of the Bureau of the European Parliament of 6 September 2005 to authorise the JPA to be held in Edinburgh, and hopes that the principle of holding JPAs in the country holding the EU Presidency will be perpetuated;\n",
        "19. Congratulates the Presidency and the Government of Mali, the Malian authorities and various local associations for their valuable contribution to the ninth session in Bamako, particularly to the workshops on the following subjects:\n",
        "20. Welcomes the fact that the alternation between an ACP country and the country holding the EU Presidency will henceforth make for real equivalence between the sessions in the ACP countries and in the European countries;\n",
        "21. Congratulates the UK Presidency and the Scottish authorities on their excellent contribution to the 10th session in Edinburgh, particularly to the workshops on the following subjects:\n",
        "22. Welcomes the Co-Presidents’ adoption of a ‘catch-the-eye’ session in Edinburgh, which effectively promoted open debate during plenary sessions, and calls for this practice to be continued;\n",
        "23. Notes with satisfaction the growing participation of non‑governmental actors at JPA sessions, with a record number of such participants attending the Edinburgh session;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Austrian Presidency and the Bureau of the European Parliament to make the necessary arrangements for the organisation of the 11th session in Vienna (Austria), from 17 to 22 June 2006, and of the 12th session in Bridgetown (Barbados), from 18 to 24 November 2006;\n",
        "25. Recalls that, on the basis of the decisions taken by the JPA Bureau in Edinburgh, and subject to the availability of funds, a joint ACP-EU mission will be sent to Ethiopia and Eritrea, and to Mauritania and Togo, during the first quarter of 2006;\n",

        "28. Emphasises that the organisation of meetings at regional or subregional level, pursuant to Article 17(3) of the Cotonou Agreement, must move into an active phase of implementation; calls on the JPA to amend its Rules of Procedure and to plan meetings of this kind, based on the existing parliamentary structures within the ACP Group, these meetings being concerned primarily with regional cooperation in the context of conflict prevention and resolution and with the conclusion and implementation of economic partnership agreements;\n",
        "29. Calls on the members of the JPA and the European co-secretariat to do everything they can to strengthen the role and the position of the JPA within the European Parliament;\n",

        "32. Welcomes the fact that JPA documents are rapidly made available on the Internet, which is an indispensable tool for the smooth running of the JPA, whose members are situated far apart from each other; calls on the JPA and the two co‑secretariats to make systematic use of electronic mail and the Internet to send documents to parliamentarians and actively to encourage Internet use where available;\n",
        "33. Calls for close cooperation between European and African parliamentarians and an exchange programme between European Parliament officials and officials of the Pan‑African Parliament in order to build up their capacities;\n",
