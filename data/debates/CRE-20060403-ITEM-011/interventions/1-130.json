{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to make three points. First, I welcome both the European Parliament report as changed and the Commission’s report on the guidelines for 2004. Things are moving in the right direction and I should like to congratulate the whole team of DG Competition and the Commissioner, who is continuing Mr Monti’s work very well. We are living in a mood of economic nationalism right now, and being the Competition Commissioner is not necessarily the easiest job in town. The Commissioner is doing a good job.\nMy second point – and one that Mr Hökmark made as well – is that it is very important to take a broad approach. To my mind, competition and the internal market are married; they go hand in hand. Commissioner Kroes takes care of the competition part and Commissioner McCreevy takes care of the internal market side. If today we were to define the four freedoms, I do not think, unfortunately, in the mood we are in, that we would get them. Therefore, keep the four freedoms in mind; they are under attack, much like competition policy in general.\nThat brings me to my final point about the four key areas dealt with in the report itself. The first is mergers: keep on fighting against the type of protectionist behaviour that you see, for example, from the Spanish Government in the Endesa case or from the Polish Government in the banking sector. Secondly, on state aid: continue your vigorous control, kill all the national champions you can – they are bad for consumers and taxpayers. I would urge you to read Mr Hökmark’s report on this issue. The third is Article 81 on cartels: fight them. They are all over the place; they try to hide; tease them out; keep the consumers happy.\nFinally, on Article 82 on dominant positions: there is a sufficiently high profile case. I am not entirely sure that all is clear on that case. One can perhaps see both sides, but it is important to keep at it and, much like Mr Evans said, if we want a transatlantic market, let us keep it and let us watch out for American protectionism in the meantime.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to make three points.
