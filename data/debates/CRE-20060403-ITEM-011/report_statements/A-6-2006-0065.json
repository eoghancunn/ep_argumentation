    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the fact that, since 1 May 2004, the Community’s competition policy has been extended to ten new Member States whose national competition authorities (NCAs) have joined the European Competition Network (ECN) with the aim of integrating them into the EU;\n",
        "2.  Continues to argue that a more active and growing role for the Parliament in the development of competition policy is likely to import greater transparency and legitimacy, and repeats Parliament’s aspiration with regard to the granting of codecision powers;\n",
        "3.  Supports the competition policy pursued by the EU in general, and expresses its appreciation of the modernising reform which the Commission has carried out in the field of competition;\n",
        "4.  Calls, as a matter of urgency, for the speedy completion of the final part of competition policy modernisation, namely as regards the application of Article 82 of the EC Treaty on the prohibition of abuses of dominant positions; stresses that account must be taken in this connection of the dynamics of increasingly globalised markets;\n",
        "5.  Welcomes the fact that the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities now less frequently cast doubt on Commission competition decisions, but regrets that there are still great differences as to how the Commission intends to interpret the Altmark test in practice; calls on the Commission to issue a clear and precise interpretative communication on the fourth criterion set out in the Altmark judgement;\n",
        "6.  Regrets that the 2004 competition report does not dedicate a separate chapter to a discussion of services of general interest, as was the case in the 2001 report onwards, and urges the Commission to reinstate this approach in its future reports;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the Commission's modernisation package, its new scheme for block exempting technology transfer agreements, and the progress made towards distinguishing between accessible and inaccessible documents and laying down standards for dealing with confidential information in procedures;\n",
        "8.  Points out that the Commission investigated some areas of great importance during 2004, such as broadband Internet services, roaming for international mobile calls, and telecommunications generally, and urges it to keep a close watch on the development of these sectors so as to encourage competition in areas that are of importance to the development of the Information Society;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission to study and analyse in detail the problems associated with collective bargaining in sensitive economic sectors, such as agriculture, particularly in connection with relations between small and medium-sized producers or producer associations, on the one hand, and major processing or marketing firms, on the other;\n",
        "10. Congratulates the Commission on its firm and professional approach to the fight against abuses of dominant positions and welcomes the Commission's consultation on a more effective implementation of Article 82;\n",
        "11. Urges the Commission to take measures to optimise the exchange of information among NCAs within the ECN, and to enhance the quality of such information, with a view to guaranteeing the uniform application of EC competition policy;\n",
        "12. Urges the Commission to make an effort to promote the correct application of the competition rules in all Member States, and to intervene in good time where the competition rules are being applied unsatisfactorily or in a discriminatory manner;\n",
        "13. Notes that an effective competition policy must constantly take account of the interests of the consumer and must not be an instrument for the disruption of the market;\n",
        "14. Encourages the Commission to clarify the sometimes obscure relationships among NCAs and 'national champions', so as to remove any suspicion of complicity and safeguard consumers' interests (for instance, at the beginning of 2005 the media revealed the secret agreements between the three main French mobile telephony operators); recognises that there has been insufficient time so far to assess the effectiveness of the reforms devolving the implementation of EC competition law to NCAs;\n",
        "15. Congratulates the Commission on its vigilance with regard to the regulation of mergers and acquisitions that could lead to the strengthening of dominant positions;\n",
        "16. Expresses its concern at the continued failure to achieve full liberalisation in the EU gas and electric markets and welcomes the sector inquiry launched by the Commission into the functioning of the internal market in gas and electricity;\n",
        "17. Welcomes the sector inquiries launched by the Commission in relation to bank payment systems and business insurance, but urges that the inquiry process be undertaken in a way which allows adequate time for full and thorough responses to the Commission;\n",
        "18. Suggests that, in the case of major networked public services, competition must be guided by strong public service obligations so as to ensure necessary investment and to prevent the emergence of new monopolies;\n",
        "19. Recognises the important contribution which an effective competition policy makes to the achievement of the Lisbon strategy;\n",
        "20. Welcomes the environmentally friendly criteria of the Commission applied in the approval of several environmental aid schemes, including those concerning rail transport, and urges the Commission to develop further the conditions for transparency for such schemes, so that they may serve as precedents for other regions and Member States;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to defend its doctrine of combating monopolies and illegal cartels and of providing reasons to justify State aid in future negotiations on the organisation of international trade; also urges the Commission to promote international cooperation in competition matters by means of instruments of a multilateral or bilateral nature and to encourage emerging and developing countries to participate increasingly in that cooperation;\n",
        "22. Highlights the importance of encouraging consumer information, draws attention to the fundamental role of consumer information in ensuring that there is a genuine competition culture, and points out the need to consider at Community level private compensation in cases of anti-competitive conduct;\n",
        "23. Reaffirms its support for a more proactive role of the Parliament in the development of competition policy by enhancing codecision powers of the Parliament;\n",
        "24. Urges the Commission to continue to review the operation of the judicial system in relation to competition cases in order to consider improvements to the speed of access to justice and in order to maximise the experience and skills of the judiciary dealing with competition cases;\n",
        "25. Urges the Commission to build on the appointment of a Consumer Liaison Officer in order to develop a closer dialogue and engagement between the Commission and consumers;\n",
        "26. Believes that the effective application of competition policy is an essential tool to achieving an efficient market structure, which operates in the interests of consumers and which has a positive and significant impact upon consumers' daily lives; wishes to emphasise that closer integration of the internal market sometimes makes it more natural to analyse the state of competition on the whole internal market rather than on different submarkets; and calls on the Commission to produce clearer guidelines on its market definition in such cases;\n",
        "27. Welcomes the Commission's positive response to Parliament's recommendations concerning the further development of European Competition Days, including the integration of consumer organisations and the national media in the planning process of European Competition Days;\n",
        "28. Welcomes the Commission's continued commitment to the International Competition network, particularly as regards the work undertaken in assisting China in the development of its draft antitrust law;\n",
        "29. Welcomes the continued progress which the ten new Member States are making in rapidly adapting to EC merger control, the competition rules, and, in particular, State aid regulation and urges the Commission to pursue the process of technical assistance and cooperation;\n",
        "30. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
