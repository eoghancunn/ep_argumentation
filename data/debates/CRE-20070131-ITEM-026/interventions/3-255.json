{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I shall aim to comply with my allotted speaking time so that we can finish before midnight!\nOf course we welcome this report which is so focused on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies. I am pleased to know that this report is well in tune with our own analysis of this subject. The Commission is fully committed to improving the mainstreaming of sustainability in our development cooperation. The overarching objective of this cooperation is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development. We are working in the direction of most of the recommendations which are made in the report, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Budreikaitė. I shall illustrate this only with a few examples.\nFirstly, we are improving the mainstreaming of environmental concerns in development policies in a variety of ways, for example by staff training, by setting up an environmental helpdesk, by systematic preparation of country and regional environmental profiles and, whenever relevant, strategic environmental assessments and environmental impact assessments.\nSecondly, we are stepping up assistance to developing countries to adapt to climate change. We are working to enhance our alliance-building with the developing countries in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation. Because the most immediate effect of climate change on developing countries is the incidence of extreme weather phenomena, we are also preparing a new disaster risk reduction strategy.\nThirdly, we are promoting clean and renewable energy through specific projects. Another new initiative that has been well received by the international community is the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund.\nFourthly, we are working hard towards preventing the import of illegally sourced wood via the negotiation of voluntary partnership agreements under the forest law enforcement governance and trade initiative. Negotiations have recently started with Malaysia, Ghana and Indonesia.\nLastly, we are programming resources for building capacity in developing countries to prevent illegal dumping of toxic waste and to clean stocks of solid pesticides.\nThe efforts needed to deal with these objectives and with others also raised in the report certainly remain considerable. The European Parliament’s support in relation to the development cooperation instrument and the environment and natural resources climatic strategy will be critical, and from this point of view I want to express gratitude for your engagement and support.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission .
