        "36. Believes that the establishment of a permanent advisory and monitoring body for Sustainable Development, which would include Member States and civil society representatives and would scrutinise the mainstreaming of the concept into EU policies and programmes, with a particular focus on development cooperation, would be of great general and crucial to supporting the Commission's internal Interservice Group on Environmental Mainstreaming in Development Co-operation;\n",

        "46. Reminds the Commission of the need to base its development programmes on  transparency and accountability, as corruption in developing countries often negatively reinforces unsustainable trends, for instance in fields such as illegal logging; and emphasises the need to support the establishment of independent anti-corruption watchdogs in developing countries by allocating sufficient resources to such projects;\n",

        "54. Stresses that, in a context of anarchic urban growth, urban water and sanitation is a key development issue, as good practices in the field of democratic governance locally may be built up around local public services;\n",
        "55. Calls on developing countries, in order to ensure the sustainable exploitation of their water resources, to decentralise water management to local level so as to involve users and decision-makers in the formulation of water policies at as close a level as possible to citizens' needs;\n",
