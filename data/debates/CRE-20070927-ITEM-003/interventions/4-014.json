Each day brings us a lot of cases where correct transposition is necessary to protect victims. I would also like to mention that some practices related to linguistic policy may be considered as indirect discrimination under the Directive. For example, in my country, Latvia, as well as in neighbouring Estonia, states which have a high proportion of ethnic minorities, there are disproportionate language criteria for employment, as well as requirements to use only one language in communication with authorities. I believe that if such practices lead to under-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in different areas of social life, Member States have a duty to develop policies aiming at ensuring equal access and avoiding discrimination.\nThere is another matter of concern. Sometimes different treatment on the grounds of nationality may be considered as indirect ethnic discrimination. It happens when policy concerning citizenship is aimed at excluding those of minority backgrounds – Roma or Russians, for example.\nI hope that the European courts, as well as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which stated that there should not be racial or ethnic discrimination on access to nationality, will not be less progressive and will monitor carefully the impact of policy concerning nationality on persons belonging to different ethnic groups.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Tatjana Ždanoka, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Buitenweg for this report, which draws attention to one of the more serious issues in Europe’s problem of racial and ethnic discrimination.\nCommissioner, in my opinion the Commission should be more active in order to promote transposition of the Racial Equality Directive.
