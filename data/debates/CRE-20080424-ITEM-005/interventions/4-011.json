{"speaker": "Androula Vassiliou,", "english": "Androula Vassiliou, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, its rapporteurs for its very constructive reaction to the Commission’s Green Paper on market-based instruments.\nLast year, this Green Paper was presented together with Commissioner Dimas with the purpose of launching a broad public debate on advancing the use of market-based instruments for environment and energy-related policy purposes in the Community. The Green Paper starts from the broadly shared view that not only market-based instruments, such as taxes, charges and tradable permit schemes, but also targeted subsidies, provide a flexible and cost-efficient means of reaching given policy objectives.\nI am pleased that Parliament supports this approach. Equally, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the view that market-based instruments cannot be seen and used in isolation and should be combined with regulatory instruments.\nParliament’s report is a very useful and very comprehensive contribution to the discussion about the use of market-based instruments, both at Community and national level. Its scope is even broader, covering issues such as the greening of gross domestic product and the review of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. While these issues are obviously linked to the subject of the Green Paper and highly important in their own right, they were left out of the Green Paper, as they were covered in other Commission documents elaborated in parallel.\nThe Commission will take account of the numerous comments and requests made by Parliament in the context of its work on the various issues mentioned in the Green Paper and on further specific initiatives.\nAs far as imminent actions foreseen for this year are concerned, I can inform you that the Commission is planning to revise the Energy Taxation Directive in the autumn with the objective of ensuring that it contributes more effectively to meeting the EU energy and climate change targets.\nMost importantly, and in line with the request of Parliament, one of the main aspects will be to achieve better complementarity with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In my view, it is very important to provide for the best possible synergies between the revised EU Emissions Trading Scheme and energy taxation in such a way as to ensure that the EU meets its climate change and energy goals in the least costly way.\nOur aim is to present the proposal in time for Parliament to render an opinion before the end of its current mandate. There are areas where effective action can only be taken by legislation at EU level. This concerns, for example, the taxation of energy use – which I have just spoken about – and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere are, however, other areas where Member States can take effective action themselves and where they can cooperate and benefit from experiences gained in other Member States. To this end, the Green Paper suggests the creation of a forum on market-based instruments, which would allow knowledge to be shared across sectoral boundaries and Member States.\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate about the further use of market-based instruments, which is of use to all policymakers, whether here in Strasbourg, in Brussels or in the national capitals.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Androula Vassiliou, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, its rapporteurs for its very constructive reaction to the Commission’s Green Paper on market-based instruments.\nLast year, this Green Paper was presented together with Commissioner Dimas with the purpose of launching a broad public debate on advancing the use of market-based instruments for environment and energy-related policy purposes in the Community.
