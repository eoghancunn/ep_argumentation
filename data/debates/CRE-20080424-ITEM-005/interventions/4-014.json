{"speaker": "Anders Wijkman,", "english": "Anders Wijkman, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, this is, as already has been said, an important report and I want to congratulate Ms Ferreira.\nWe know that our current economic model fails to integrate environmental costs into market prices. Already at the Stockholm Conference in 1972 the ‘polluter pays’ principle was established and agreed upon. But, as we know, it has not been implemented in most countries.\nThis report is very important. It responds to the many market failures we experience in several areas, where of course climate change is the most obvious problem today. The report suggests plenty of initiatives in many key areas. In general most of those proposals are well-drafted. However, I think more effort could have been made by us all to try to shorten the report and merge some of the individual paragraphs; very similar demands are now being put forward. I think the report would have benefited and become much clearer.\nOn behalf of my group and as has already been said by Mr Purvis, I have to mention that we have difficulties with a few paragraphs. One is paragraph 26. You cannot favour an emissions trading system and at the same time ask for a general CO 2 tax at European level. It is inconsistent. Secondly, we have some problems with paragraph 24. While we agree with most of the contents, it is, in our opinion, too general in its language and somehow gives the impression that auctioning revenues would be or should be part of the EU budget in the future. That is not something we can support. But, apart from that, we are in general in support and once again congratulations to Ms Ferreira.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Anders Wijkman, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, this is, as already has been said, an important report and I want to congratulate Ms Ferreira.\nWe know that our current economic model fails to integrate environmental costs into market prices.
