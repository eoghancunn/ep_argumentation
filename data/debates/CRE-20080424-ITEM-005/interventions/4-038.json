{"speaker": "Androula Vassiliou,", "english": "Androula Vassiliou, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments and the views they expressed during the debate. I will try to comment on some of the comments made.\nMs Ferreira commented on the lack of information about the replies to our debate. I would like to inform you that we received 170 replies, which are being analysed at the moment, and we hope to have a summary of these replies by the end of the summer, in which case we shall, of course, provide you with this summary.\nMr Wijkman raised the point of inconsistency between emission trading systems and the carbon tax. I would like to say that, in the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, one of the objectives is precisely to deal with and tackle any possible inconsistency.\nTwo Members raised the issue of possible border tax adjustments to prevent carbon leakage in case international negotiations fail. I would like to say that the main and priority goal of the Commission is to reach a successful post-Kyoto international agreement to address climate change.\nOn the issue of tax on air kerosene, the issue has already been discussed with the Member States. It proved to be a very sensitive issue and no progress was made. Two Member States apply a tax of this type, but I must point out that it also raises questions of international law. The Commission does not intend to submit any proposal for such a tax.\nOn the use of reduced VAT rates to achieve environmental goals, the Commission services are currently studying the issue.\nFinally, I would like to say that a number of the comments made by honourable Members fall within the work of different Commissioners. I have taken note of all your comments and I shall convey them to the Commissioners concerned. They will be analysed and taken into consideration in the follow-up action to the Green Paper.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Androula Vassiliou, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments and the views they expressed during the debate.
