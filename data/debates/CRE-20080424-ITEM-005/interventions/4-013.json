Therefore, greater use of market-based instruments is crucial, as they are cost-effective means to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency.\nThese indirect taxes, tradable permits and subsidies, I think, will assist the European Union to achieve its emissions targets. However, while recognising that Member States need to retain flexibility over their own tax systems, any tool or aid that can support our industries and consumers to make greener choices is to be welcomed, and our policies must be such that they incentivise behavioural change.\nTherefore, it is imperative that market failures are corrected and that we have carbon-based pricing to reflect environmental damage as part of the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Reduced VAT on environmentally friendly products can assist the vulnerable in society, especially the elderly, who are now more than ever at risk of energy poverty.\nFurthermore, any revenues raised through auctioning should be reinvested to tackle energy poverty and fund further environmental programmes.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill, Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . − Mr President, whilst a great deal is said about climate change but little is happening in terms of concrete measures, I think the EU needs to set a global example.
