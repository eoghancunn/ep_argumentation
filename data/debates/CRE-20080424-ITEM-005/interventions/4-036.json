It considers issues that, as this debate has illustrated, will become increasingly important in the future.\nIn today’s debate, we have discussed how we have to have an ecological mind-set. I am convinced that there is considerable ecological awareness in the European Union and in individual Member States. People want to live ecologically, they want to have an ecological lifestyle and they are very ecologically aware.\nHowever, let us not forget that many European Union countries, such as Bulgaria and Poland, lived for many decades under a different system. Our economies were based on another method of obtaining energy. The regulations on the system of environmental taxes could therefore reduce the competitiveness of these economies and, as a result, reduce environmental awareness.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Sylwester Chruszcz (NI). - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Ferreira for the report she has presented.
