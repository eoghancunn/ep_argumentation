{"speaker": "Mieczysław Edmund Janowski (UEN). -", "english": "Mieczysław Edmund Janowski (UEN). - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, this a good report. I do not want to repeat the points that have been raised already, but I would like just to draw attention to a few particular issues.\nFirstly, human beings are not the most important part of the ‘environment’ and humans do not own the water, the soil and the earth. Humans only use them, we are just tenants. We must keep this fact in mind. Issues that affect the environment know no borders – air, water and the soil are not subject to frontiers – so our activities also have to go across frontiers. This applies at European Union level, but it also applies throughout the whole world. Otherwise our activities will not achieve their objective.\nI would like to emphasise one other matter. Apart from these fiscal issues and economic pressures, it is very important to raise people’s awareness, starting from children. Otherwise we will not have energy-saving technical devices, houses, cars and vehicles. I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the progress so far and I would ask you to take further steps in this direction.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mieczysław Edmund Janowski (UEN). - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, this a good report.
