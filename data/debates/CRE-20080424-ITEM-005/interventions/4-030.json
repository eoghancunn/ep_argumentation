For example, carbon dioxide emission limits were allocated to individual Member States without taking into account the backwardness in their development, which, in Poland among other countries, has resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of electricity and, as a result, a visible jump in the costs of production and also living costs.\nSecondly, the implementation of the climate package, according to the estimates of the European Commission itself, will come to about EUR 50 billion per annum. In a situation where the majority of the fastest growing nations of the world, such as China, India and Brazil, as well as economic powerhouses such as the United States, are not too bothered about climate change, it could well happen that the European economy will stop being competitive in world markets, which means it will be necessary to introduce instruments to protect European output, burdened as it is by such high additional costs.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zbigniew Krzysztof Kuźmiuk (UEN). - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to draw attention to just two matters in this debate.\nFirst of all, the way that the burden associated with counteracting climate change has been allocated within the European Union framework is highly unfair.
