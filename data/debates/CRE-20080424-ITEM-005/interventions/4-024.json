As she rightly points out in paragraph 28 it could happen that they do not fulfil the stated objectives but, instead, become just a means to increase tax revenue.\nThe matters that have been discussed in some detail are aimed just at the future. The question is: according to the polluter pays principle, who is to clean the soil, water and air that have been polluted by past industrial waste or by outdated pesticides, asbestos, phosphorus pentachloride and other compounds?\nI think that the green bonds referred to in paragraph 67 would be very good for this purpose. Companies involved in this process could be allocated tasks that had not otherwise been dealt with and would carry them out with the help of the financial markets. The introduction of such bonds, which could be called green bonds, would make it possible to resolve many problems associated with the introduction of market-based instruments into the area of environmental protection. It is an excellent idea and I congratulate Mrs Ferreira.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Wiesław Stefan Kuc (UEN). - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the market-based instruments for environmental policy purposes, as described by the rapporteur, come down in large part to taxes and charges.
