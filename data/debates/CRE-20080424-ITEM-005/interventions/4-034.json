I want to draw your attention to the fact that, according to scientific research, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases not before the earth heats up but only after it heats up. This warming process correlates with the sun’s activity so that warming is an effect rather than a cause. As a result, the main emitters of carbon dioxide after warming are the oceans. Of course, I am not against a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity but I think that we have to accept our responsibility for pollution that has health-related and other consequences, rather than responsibility for climate change. We should call a spade a spade.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Nina Škottová (PPE-DE). - (CS) As we heard in many previous speeches, carbon dioxide is an important and perhaps a key player in so-called ecological price determination, and is presented as the cause of climate change.
