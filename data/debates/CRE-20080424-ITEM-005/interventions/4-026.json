Secondly, the EU is the world’s largest economy, with enormous production and foreign trade, and the Member States are united in taking responsibility for the environmental consequences of this fact. This combination of size and agreement on fundamental environmental targets gives the EU the opportunity to exercise a global influence which can be of major importance.\nHowever, the report does not inspire trust. It makes no distinction between consumption of finite resources and impact on climate. The rapporteur also shamelessly uses the climate question as an argument for supranationalism, bureaucracy and protectionism, making an all-out call for joint taxation, a review of the notion of free competition and tariff increases. There is no realisation that countries must seek solutions in competition with each other. Then to cap it all, there is the usual officious statement that we must adopt a new lifestyle in our western societies.\nAppalling!
