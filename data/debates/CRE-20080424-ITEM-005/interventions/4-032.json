{"speaker": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). -", "english": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). - Mr President, I offer many congratulations to Ms Ferreira for an excellently balanced report. Our environment is suffering under the insults inflicted as a result of an ever-increasing world population and man’s uncontrolled appetite for materialistic consumption. The climate is changing, biodiversity is suffering and natural resources are diminishing. The rapporteur, having fully understood the task at hand, is rightly supporting the view that the main market instruments needed to remedy the situation are financial incentives and taxes.\nConsequently, I fully support the idea of an EU environmental taxation system, which will inevitably have to be uniform amongst the Member States. At the same time, an effectively revised carbon emissions trading scheme will, I am sure, help to improve matters significantly.\nOf course, one should never forget the fact that making citizens adopt environmentally friendly lifestyles is not just a market-based issue: creating an environmentally caring consciousness also involves proper education and learning from an early stage and continuing throughout life.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marios Matsakis (ALDE). - Mr President, I offer many congratulations to Ms Ferreira for an excellently balanced report.
