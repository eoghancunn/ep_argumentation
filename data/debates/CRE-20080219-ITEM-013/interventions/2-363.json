{"speaker": "Ona Juknevičienė (ALDE). –", "english": "Ona Juknevičienė (ALDE). – Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Özdemir for preparing this very comprehensive report.\nAs chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries, and in connection with this resolution, I would like to address a few issues which I consider important.\nFirstly, Central Asia has an obvious growing importance for the European Union and the world as a whole, no doubt owing to its rich energy resources. We have many shared interests in promoting security and tackling threats such as terrorism and drug-smuggling. I am glad that the European Union’s strategy for a new partnership with Central Asia addresses those matters very firmly, as does as this resolution.\nThis region occupies a crucial geostrategic position, particularly as it shares a border with Afghanistan, China and Russia. Therefore, we must clearly define our objectives and priorities, bearing in mind this context.\nIn 2010, Kazakhstan will become the presiding country of the OSCE, which is responsible for ensuring democracy and fundamental human rights. I am pleased for my colleagues, but I worry about the people of Kazakhstan, where the current elected Parliament does not include a single opposition member.\nAll the countries of Central Asia still have a long way to go on the road to economic and political reform and the building of democratic societies. The example of the former Soviet republics, including my country, Lithuania, shows that 17 years of independence is not long enough to fully achieve real change. However, we must deliver our overriding message, which is that Europe will not seek material benefits at the expense of human values.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ona Juknevičienė (ALDE). – Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Özdemir for preparing this very comprehensive report.\nAs chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries, and in connection with this resolution, I would like to address a few issues which I consider important.\nFirstly, Central Asia has an obvious growing importance for the European Union and the world as a whole, no doubt owing to its rich energy resources.
