{"speaker": "Józef Pinior (PSE). –", "english": "Józef Pinior (PSE). – Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Özdemir on his excellent report on the EU strategy for Central Asia.\nCentral Asia is part of the road which has connected the great Euro-Asiatic civilisations since antiquity. In today’s global context, the ancient Silk Road can be taken as a symbol of the high political, cultural and trade potential of that region. Central Asia is the region where the European Union, China, India and Iran meet. There is no doubt that the countries of this region – Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – will be one of the main areas of EU external activity in the coming years.\nBy the way, Central Asia is a region in which the EU and Turkey have a shared interest. Turkey’s cultural, linguistic and strategic influence in the region is one of the arguments for Turkish membership of the EU.\nLet me make two points. Firstly, the EU should provide assistance in these countries in a perspective of human rights, democracy and education. There is a need for EU support for the development of civil society, liberal democratic change and the rule of law in these countries.\nSecondly, I would like to stress the importance of partnership in the field of energy policy. Special attention should be given to projects connecting oil and gas fields and the distribution system in Central Asia to pipelines connecting with the European Union, including future projects such as Nabucco. Further strengthening cooperation between Central Asia and the Black Sea region in the fields of energy and transportation is essential for the accomplishment of the EU’s goals.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Józef Pinior (PSE). – Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Özdemir on his excellent report on the EU strategy for Central Asia.\nCentral Asia is part of the road which has connected the great Euro-Asiatic civilisations since antiquity.
