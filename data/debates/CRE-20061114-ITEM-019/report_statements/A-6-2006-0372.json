    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the Commission's commitment, and particularly the new Framework Strategy, to foster the knowledge of languages and take cultural and socio-economic advantage of it;\n",
        "2.  Considers that, in order to achieve the objectives set by the Lisbon strategy, it is essential to improve the quality, effectiveness and accessibility of the education and training systems in the European Union by promoting foreign language learning;\n",
        "3.  Acknowledges the strategic importance of European World Languages as a communication vehicle and as a means of solidarity, cooperation, and economic investment and, therefore, as one of the main political guidelines of European policy on multilingualism;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the Commission's long-term objective to improve individual language skills, referring to the target set in 2002 in the Barcelona European Council whereby citizens should learn at least two foreign languages in addition to their mother tongue;\n",
        "5.  Reminds the EU Member States, to that end, that it is necessary to take appropriate measures to promote a genuine policy of learning foreign language skills ; furthermore, re-affirms that the early learning of languages is of considerable importance, and should be based on effective methods according to the best available techniques;\n",
        "6.  Considers that there is a lack of detailed and reliable data and appropriate indicators related to the current situation of foreign language competence in the Member States and therefore welcomes the proposal for a European Indicator of Language Competence; that indicator should include all official EU languages and could, if feasible from a procedural point of view, be extended beyond the five widely-spoken languages to include the other EU languages, in order to gain a true picture of language competence;\n",
        "7.  Believes that proposals for multilingualism should not be limited to the main official/ Member State languages;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes the Commission’s commitment to give citizens access to EU legislation, procedures and information in their own languages; however this should include as many as possible of the languages of Member States used by EU citizens; in this way the Commission's statement to the effect that citizens have a right to access the EU in their own language without any barriers would become a reality; this would be an important step in closing the gap between the EU and many of its citizens, which is the main aim of Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate;\n",
        "9.  Considers that in accordance with the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament concerning languages used for informing consumers in the Community (COM(1993)0456), the EU must respect the principle of subsidiarity in language policy, by which the EU, through the implementation of its own language regime or in the way of his sectoral law, shall not modify the language legislation existing in every Member State on all or part of its territory;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission and the other European institutions to make the best possible use of new digital and technological translation tools on their Internet sites so as to enable European citizens to have access to, and obtain from the Internet, information about Europe in their own languages;\n",
        "11. Considers that the widest opportunities should be provided for migrants to learn the language or languages of host countries, as defined by the legislation of those countries, with a view to their social and cultural integration in so far as this is necessary, using methods which have proved effective in language learning and for the integration of migrant citizens and to enable them to be taught in their mother tongue as a way of preserving their ties with their country of origin;\n",
        "12. Welcomes the idea of encouraging Member States to establish National Plans, because it recognises the need for language planning at Member State level; this will act to enhance many of the less widely used languages and raise awareness of the importance of linguistic diversity; suggests that Member State Plans should include the lesser-used languages within each Member State and examine the possibility for interested adults to learn these languages, and include these projects as examples of best practice;\n",
        "13. Supports action for better teacher training, also for non-language and vocational teachers, and adds that the number of languages taught both within and outside school should be broadened to enable future teachers to learn, and subsequently teach, a greater diversity of languages under the same conditions, providing that there is an expression of interest in this direction; recalls, in this connection, that language training is essential to promote and facilitate mobility not only for students but also for all workers seeking to carry on an occupation in one of the Member States;\n",
        "14. Urges that particular attention be given to promoting language learning for people in disadvantaged and difficult circumstances and for people with disabilities;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the greater use of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), where pupils learn a subject through the medium of a foreign language, and calls on the Member States to form a network of best practices, in particular by analysing the results obtained from immersion courses in multilingual countries;\n",
        "16. Welcomes the fact that higher education institutions play a more active role in promoting multilingualism not only amongst students and staff, but also amongst the wider local community, and therefore believes that linkages should be encouraged between universities and national, local and regional authorities ;\n",
        "17. Considers that the language used in Erasmus courses should be the official language of  the host country's or region's educational system, and that it should be ensured that Erasmus students attain a level of proficiency in that language which enables them to properly follow courses provided in that language;\n",
        "18. Welcomes the focus on research and technological development activities on language-related information technologies within the 7th Framework Research Programme in order to enhance multilingualism through new IT;\n",
        "19. Supports the proposals for multilingualism in the information society and the creation and circulation of multilingual content and knowledge; there is an increasing array of technologies that will help a greater use of all languages, including those less widely used; technology offers the greatest potential for ensuring social linguistic space for all of Europe’s languages;\n",
        "20. Supports the proposals to develop language-related professions and industries; all European languages will need new technologies such as speech processing, voice recognition and so on, as well work on terminology, developing language teaching, certification and testing; otherwise lesser-used languages will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages - especially English;\n",
        "21. Supports a European Standard for Translation Services and believes that there should be a proactive policy for developing translation services for less widely used languages;\n",
        "22. Welcomes the proposal for greater transparency in language teaching, testing and certification by publishing an inventory of the systems currently available;\n",
        "23. Calls on the European institutions and bodies to improve their communication with citizens in their own national language, regardless of whether the language in question has official status at Member State or EU level;\n",
        "24. Calls for a clear, coherent EU language plan and EU language legislation; there is a need for an EU language act to give a legal base to language rights both collectively and individually; on the basis of such legislation an EU language plan could be drawn up to ensure linguistic diversity and language rights;\n",
        "25. Encourages the Commission to continue implementing the proposals set out in the Ebner Report in so far as they are feasible, and to notify Parliament regularly of the results;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to facilitate and promote access to information and funding for applicant bodies seeking to promote multilingualism through networks and/or projects funded by the Commission from 2007 onwards; o o       o\n",
        "27. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the Member States.\n"
