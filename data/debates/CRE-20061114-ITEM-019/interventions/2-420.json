{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Joan i Marí for his excellent report on the Commission communication relating to a new framework strategy for multilingualism. Not only the framework strategy, but also the report has been drawn up in the spirit of diversity and unity. That should be the leading line in our implementation of policies in this area.\nI am sure we would all like to see a multilingual European society in which the rate of individual multilingualism steadily increases until every citizen has practical skills and at least two languages in addition to their mother tongue. That is the famous ‘Mother tongue plus two’ formula agreed by EU leaders in Barcelona in 2002.\nI recently set up the internal multilingualism network in the European Commission and established the High Level Group on Multilingualism. These are both implementation initiatives under the new framework strategy for multilingualism.\nAnother priority is to develop early language learning. If we want to build a multilingual society we have to start as soon as possible. We have to ensure that language learning in pre-school and primary school is effective, for that is where key attitudes towards languages and cultures are formed. The new lifelong learning programme will offer a wide range of funding possibilities for projects promoting language awareness, for access to language learning resources, as well as for networks contributing to the development of language policies.\nFor the first time the education and training programme has, as a specific objective, the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity. For the first time also, a transversal action will support multilateral projects and networks in that field. These are new opportunities open to all the languages spoken in the European Union.\nLet me now say a few words on the European indicator for language competence. That was one of the subjects in another recent communication from the Commission. The first meeting of the advisory board took place just two weeks ago, at the end of October. The experts attending the meeting, representing 22 countries, showed much interest and consensus on taking forward the establishment of that indicator.\nI am pleased to note that the report by Mr Joan i Marí recognises the Commission’s efforts to promote language learning and linguistic diversity in the European Union. The report contains a thorough analysis of our framework strategy to create a multilingual society and acknowledges our commitment to achieving the objectives stated in our communication.\nI should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his inspiring report, and would stress that the Commission is determined to pursue the ideas and actions set out in this new strategy for multilingualism in our Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission .
