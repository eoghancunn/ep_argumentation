    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Regrets the delay in the Commission communication and the lack of ambition shown, given that the proposals put forward are insufficient and in some cases inappropriate when measured against the scale and severity of the crisis facing the sector, which the Commission itself notes and describes;\n",
        "2.   Deplores a policy which, taking advantage of the socio-economic deterioration in the industry owing to the steep rise in fuel prices, seeks to promote the scrapping of vessels and the permanent cessation of activities;\n",
        "3.   Regrets that the measures proposed do not have a genuine socio-economic dimension and that, instead, they are measures that take no account of the consequences of their implementation for vessel crews;\n",
        "4.   Draws attention to the fact that the Commission communication does not contain a coherent analysis of the current state of the fishing industry, particularly of fishing effort;\n",
        "5.   Stresses that many of the proposals put forward will at most have a medium and long-term impact on the economic situation in the fishing industry;\n",
        "6.   Regrets that, as regards rescue and restructuring aid, the Commission continues to block the possibility of granting compensatory payments and operating aid, and therefore stresses the need to adopt immediate concrete measures to reduce the high instability of fuel prices for the industry, in particular by creating support measures related to their costs; requests, in this context, the creation of a guarantee fund with Community participation which will safeguard the stability of fuel prices and the granting of a transitional compensatory payment for fishing enterprises affected;\n",
        "7.   Considers it necessary to make use of all the possibilities and financial margins within the framework of the Community budget for 2006 in order to finance extraordinary support measures for the industry, enabling it to overcome the difficulties posed by the rise in fuel prices, for as long as no other type of measure is implemented;\n",
        "8.   Calls on the Commission, with a view to guaranteeing the competitiveness of the EU fleet operating outside Community waters, which must compete on the same markets with fleets from third countries whose costs may be more than 300% less than for a Community vessel, to study the industry's proposals to create a framework which could grant tax credits;\n",
        "9.   Urges that a public insurance scheme be set up, guaranteed at national and Community level, for unforeseeable circumstances in the fishing industry;\n",
        "10. Urges the Commission to consider the current fuel price crisis as an unforeseeable circumstance covered by Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community assistance in the fisheries sector[3], which governs the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), so that the same short-term aid can be granted as in the event of temporary cessation of activities, without any capacity-reduction or biological criteria; recalls the commitments long given in this context;\n",
        "11. Urges the Commission to increase the period for rescue aid to 12 months;\n",
        "12. Stresses that public aid should also be targeted at safeguarding the interests of vessel crews, meeting their needs and resolving the problems affecting them;\n",
        "13. Expresses its disappointment at the rules recently announced by the Commission, raising the 'de minimis' aid ceiling for the fishing industry to only EUR 30 000 over three years; recalls the insistent requests from the industry and the administrations of many Member States that the amount of such aid be increased to EUR 100 000, and compares this figure with the ceiling recently agreed for other productive sectors, which stands at up to EUR 200 000; underlines  the commitments given as regards increasing the value of the ‘de minimis’ rule for the fishing industry and calls on the Commission to revise the recently adopted agreement upwards as a matter of urgency;\n",
        "14. Urges the Commission to make it possible to advance aid under the FIFG and the EFF in order to set up financing lines to offset the rise in operating costs; Fleet renewal and modernisation\n",
        "15. Notes the Commission’s proposal to take account, in relation to future restructuring plans, of investment linked to changes in fishing gear, the purchase of equipment and replacement of engines, with the aim of contributing to conversion, efficiency and energy saving;\n",
        "16. Takes the view that restructuring plans in individual EU Member States should form a fundamental part of the restructuring of the fishing industry;\n",
        "17. Regrets the lack of vision in the new EFF's approach to aid for engine replacement; takes the view that measures such as linking aid for engine replacement for vessels longer than 12 metres to a 20% reduction in power will make some fishing practices virtually unviable and may affect safety, whilst they may also encourage increased fraud in the form of underdeclaring of engine power;\n",
        "18. Stresses the need for the EFF to continue to grant aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet - in particular for the replacement of engines, for reasons of safety, environmental protection or fuel efficiency - above all for small-scale inshore and artisanal fishing, and for the replacement of vessels over 20 years old, which are no longer operating safely; Inshore fishing\n",
        "19. Asks the Commission to recognise the specific nature of small-scale inshore fishing and artisanal fishing in the CFP and to analyse the extent to which the current instruments are suitable for responding to the sector’s needs, adapting them accordingly;\n",
        "20. Asks the Commission to submit a proposal for the creation of a Community support programme for small-scale inshore fishing and artisanal fishing, which would help to coordinate actions and channel funding from other existing instruments to deal with the specific problems facing this segment of the industry; Marketing\n",
        "21. Welcomes the fact that the Commission intends to launch a comprehensive evaluation of the present common organisation of the market (COM) for fish products; stresses the need for an ambitious review of this COM in order to improve the marketing of fish and fish products and boost their added value;\n",
        "22. Considers it essential for fishermen to be more directly involved in processing and marketing so as to strengthen their profit base and improve their living standards; calls on the Commission to submit proposals for a revision of the COM for fishery products to this end, specifically by introducing mechanisms to improve first-sale prices and promote the fair and appropriate distribution of added value across the value chain;\n",
        "23. Expresses its disappointment because in many cases the possibilities for improving competitiveness provided under the current COM have not been sufficiently used by the industry and calls on the Commission, in cooperation with national administrations and the various organisations representing producers, to give maximum publicity to these possibilities and to the new possibilities which may figure in a future revision of the COM;\n",
        "24. Considers it important to consider introducing other forms of intervention similar to guarantee prices or maximum profit rates as a means of improving the distribution of added value, reducing intermediation margins;\n",
        "25. Stresses the need for the Structural Funds to contribute to the modernisation and creation of marketing infrastructures for the fishing industry;\n",
        "26. Supports the initiative to introduce a code of conduct on the trade in fish products in the European Union;\n",
        "27. Endorses the view that eco-labelling might promote product differentiation and provide an incentive for a sustainable fishing trade;\n",
        "28. Urges the Commission to study mechanisms - such as aid for consumption - to promote the marketing of processed fish products with a greater added value, in particular canned fish, in the same way as certain agricultural products;\n",
        "29. Urges the Commission to ensure the external promotion of Community fish products, such as canned fish, in particular by funding their presentation at international competitions and fairs;\n",
        "30. Considers it important for the Commission to submit a study on the impact of Community and imported aquaculture production on fish prices, in particular first-sale prices;\n",
        "31. Urges the Commission to adopt measures to ensure that the same requirements are applied to imported fish products marketed on the internal market as are applied to Community fish products;\n",
        "32. Takes the view that investment in improving the handling of fish on board, particularly support for investment in refrigeration systems, could help improve first-sale prices; Financial issues\n",
        "33. Expresses concern at the scant financial resources made available for the fishing industry in the financial framework 2007-2013, in particular for the EFF, and considers that these resources should be increased to respond to the crisis affecting the industry; Sustainability of resources\n",
        "34. Reiterates its request to the Commission that it should take a more wide-ranging view of measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks, in particular by considering and studying other factors which have a considerable impact on the marine environment and the state of fishery resources, such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, deep-sea dredging and maritime transport, to complement current management methods; asks the Commission for a Community initiative in this area;\n",
        "35. Points out that it is essential to achieve a balance between the socio-economic situation and environmental sustainability, whilst at the same time underlining the need to implement a mechanism for subsidising or compensating fishermen who are affected by the economic and social effects of stock recovery plans or other measures to provide increased protection for ecosystems, especially in less favoured regions;\n",
        "36. Points to the need for a regulatory framework for action to adjust fishing effort to available resources, with particular reference to the problem of large vessels with large gear fishing in small bodies of water;\n",
        "37. Stresses that the reduction of fishing effort and capacity must be undertaken with a view to the long-term preservation of the industry;\n",
        "38. Is convinced that the social and economic problems faced by the European fishing industry cannot be resolved without better management of fishing activities leading to the recovery of fish stocks, since with no fish there can be no fishing;\n",
        "39. Stresses that matching national fleets to existing resources must take account of the reduction in fishing effort already brought about;\n",
        "40. Recalls the need for all stock recovery measures to be taken with the involvement of fishermen and based on scientific fisheries research;\n",
        "41. Calls on the Commission to make a distinction between fishing methods and the way in which they are applied; stresses that some fishing methods that are deemed harmful when used on an industrial scale can be in keeping with a sustainable approach when used on an artisanal scale, and can thus enable fishing communities currently in terminal decline to survive;\n",
        "42. Calls on the Commission to take account of the fact that fishing activities are not self-contained but form part of broader fishing systems at regional level; stresses that restrictive measures (bans or limits) placed on one type of activity create an imbalance and result in fishing effort being transferred to other species, with serious social and economic repercussions for fishing communities and overfishing of species that were already being fully fished; Illegal fishing\n",
        "43. Considers it vital that measures be taken to strengthen the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; urges the Member States to strengthen their control mechanisms; considers that improved controls at the EU borders are necessary in order to prevent the entry into the EU of fish that has been caught illegally;\n",
        "44. Calls on the Commission to review the current common fisheries policy provisions on illegal, unreported and unregulated catches; considers that there is a particularly pressing need for regulations to prevent a significant percentage of catches from being discarded; Research\n",
        "45. Stresses the need to promote investment, through the EFF and the Seventh Community Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities, which will help to reduce energy intensity in the fishing industry and increase energy efficiency;\n",
        "46. Considers it important to assess the possibilities for changing fuel types and the synergies which might be found with the farming industry in the field of energy; Management of the CFP\n",
        "47. Notes the Commission’s proposals on the economic management of fisheries, but recalls that the distribution of quotas and fishing rights is an exclusive competence of the Member States; Participation in the management of the CFP\n",
        "48. Points out that Regional Advisory Councils may play an important role for the involvement of fishermen in the decision-making process for the common fisheries policy; stresses the importance of receiving Community aid for their operation which should be reevaluated in five years' time;\n",
        "49. Stresses the need to support fishermen’s groups and professional organisations which are willing to share responsibility for the application of the CFP (co-management);\n",
        "50. Urges greater decentralisation of the CFP as a means of guaranteeing greater involvement of fishermen, their representative organisations and fishing communities in the CFP and in improving fisheries management;\n",
        "51. Notes the need for proper organisation of fisheries markets, involving an effective control system, an eco-labelling system and the introduction of a legal code for the fishing industry; * * *\n",
        "52. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
