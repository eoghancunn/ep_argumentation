{"speaker": "Ian Hudghton,", "english": "Ian Hudghton, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Madam President, fishing-dependent communities in Scotland have suffered a drastic downturn in their economic wellbeing in recent years, directly as a result of political decisions made under the common fisheries policy – decisions made with the active cooperation of the Scottish and the UK Governments.\nLarge numbers of vessels have been forcibly scrapped, the remainder are forcibly restricted to ports for half of each month; and, on top of all that, fuel prices have drastically increased. The effect on fishing communities, on the families who depend upon the catching and processing sectors, has been very serious and very stressful.\nRegrettably, Scotland’s coastal communities continue to suffer while its own Government repeatedly declines to make use of available opportunities to make financial assistance available.\nOur rapporteur takes the view that greater decentralisation of the CFP would be an improvement, and I agree that would be a step in the right direction. However, ultimately, I regret to say that the CFP is destined to fail; and the scrapping of the CFP, coupled with a change in government in Scotland, is the only hope for fishing communities in the long-term future in Scotland.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ian Hudghton, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Madam President, fishing-dependent communities in Scotland have suffered a drastic downturn in their economic wellbeing in recent years, directly as a result of political decisions made under the common fisheries policy – decisions made with the active cooperation of the Scottish and the UK Governments.\nLarge numbers of vessels have been forcibly scrapped, the remainder are forcibly restricted to ports for half of each month; and, on top of all that, fuel prices have drastically increased.
