{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, I welcome this motion for a resolution, which highlights the detrimental effect that high fuel prices are having on the fishing industry, resulting in job losses and severe problems in fishing communities. I agree with the proposal that a guarantee fund should be set up to ensure the stability of fuel prices in a level playing field for the Community.\nI agree that the Commission paper of last spring is insufficient, particularly in relation to short-term aid. That temporary tie-up funding is part of a rescue and restructuring package severely curtails its usefulness as a support measure; and that the de minimis aid ceiling has only increased to EUR 30 000 over 3 years is also very restrictive and inequitable in relation to other sectors.\nThe fishing industry is in crisis and the Commission paper has not helped. It remains to be seen whether its medium- and long-term measures will be any better. I support recommendations that a review of the common organisation of the markets would provide for greater assistance to fishermen and their organisations to become more involved in the marketing and production of fish. I also agree that fish imports from outside the EU should be subject to the same conditions and should at least be legal. I agree that the EFF reduced funding is insufficient. This will be a problem for the restructuring of fishing fleets by implementing decommissioning schemes.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, I welcome this motion for a resolution, which highlights the detrimental effect that high fuel prices are having on the fishing industry, resulting in job losses and severe problems in fishing communities.
