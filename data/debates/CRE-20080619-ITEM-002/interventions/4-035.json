This is not related to the Gurmai report because we have spoken about that.\nWhilst you were speaking, indeed whilst Mrs Gurmai was summing up her report, I noticed that there were members of the public coming into the visitors’ gallery. I warmly welcome them and I think it is very good and important that people are coming into the visitors’ gallery, but I am also conscious that as soon as I sit down from this momentous speech that I am making, what will happen is that you will suspend the sitting until 12.00 for the voting period.\nThese poor people, who have come many hundreds of kilometres, will not have the benefit of hearing a debate and a speech this morning. They are getting a little bit from me, but I wonder if it would be possible for you and your assistants to go back to the relevant authorities and look for a way of ensuring that, in the event of the debate finishing at 11.30, as it has done this morning, with nothing scheduled until 14.00, something could be put in to fill the half-hour gap between now and 12 noon, whether it be the urgencies from this afternoon or something else of mind-boggling importance?\nI am speaking on behalf of these perhaps 100 or so people in the gallery who have come to hear people speaking and all they are going to hear at the moment is me rabbiting on for two minutes about nothing – but making a very serious point.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Mr President, on a point of order, I do not have in front of me Parliament’s Rules of Procedure but I am sure that your services do, so you will forgive me if I rise.
