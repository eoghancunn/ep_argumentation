{"speaker": "Robert Evans (PSE). –", "english": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Madam President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur for her work on bringing this initiative forward to Parliament.\nI said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soul-searching in the European Union about what the idea of Europe is for, and how we can re-engage with our citizens and really show the people of Europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them, their families and their interests.\nI think this is another example, where we are looking at safety measures and at using the most modern technology to help them when they come into difficulties; we are trying to argue that cars should be better equipped. Of course, this has a Europe-wide dimension, because cars are made in nearly every European country (far fewer are made, I have to say, in the United Kingdom than they were before). People drive cars that are French, Italian or German, that are made in Spain or Britain and assembled elsewhere and, of course, we must have transnational legislation to support the highest possible standards. If this means, through this initiative, that we can save lives through getting medical aid around and we can help people who might not otherwise have done to survive when they have an accident, then this is something that the British citizen and the citizens of the other European countries and Ireland should be able to gauge into.\nWe may look at this initiative and think this is very much futuristic and not going to happen for while. But it was not such a long time ago – I am thinking of 30 years ago when I got my first car, and I look around the room and perhaps Members here may have got their first car longer ago than that – that cars did not automatically have radios in them. Now, I do not know whether it is possible to buy a car without a radio, CD player or those sorts of things. Now cars, as the previous speaker said, are made to go faster and faster and are more sophisticated than ever: satellite navigation systems, e-systems, as we are talking about here, will be in cars very shortly and they will probably be standard in 20 years’ time. This is something we should welcome, and we should spread the news. Therefore, I congratulate all involved.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Madam President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur for her work on bringing this initiative forward to Parliament.\nI said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soul-searching in the European Union about what the idea of Europe is for, and how we can re-engage with our citizens and really show the people of Europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them, their families and their interests.\nI think this is another example, where we are looking at safety measures and at using the most modern technology to help them when they come into difficulties; we are trying to argue that cars should be better equipped.
