{"speaker": "Diana Wallis (ALDE),", "english": "Diana Wallis (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . – Mr President, I welcome very much Mr Leinen’s report, so much so that my own political group will vote against any amendments to it. Despite all this agreement and it being so late in the evening, we are all of the opinion that it is essential to have a debate on this important report.\nIn the opinion for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we highlighted the fact that this is an exercise in better law-making. The CFR and the review of the acquis can make a huge contribution to the better functioning of the internal market. However – and this was our central preoccupation – the compilation of the CFR is a political exercise: it involves political choices. Therefore, the European Parliament must be fully involved as a co-legislator.\nWe all welcome the setting-up of the project group, which augurs well for good future cooperation with the Commission. However, we still have a concern that the Commission should present a coherent approach. That means that not only DG Sanco, but also DG Justice and DG Internal Market should be fully involved in the process.\nAbove all, this project is of practical importance for the internal market, both consumers and businesses alike. In my own country – which is not known for its support of anything that might even start to resemble a European contract code – an independent survey by a big law firm highlighted the transactional costs of an incoherent contract law in the internal market.\nI believe this demonstrates what many of us have always felt: practical advances in EU civil law like this can assist to make Europe more popular if we get it right. However, in order to do that we must have discussion and debate. This is not just a technical legal exercise, it is a political one. If we ever get to the stage of a European contract code, then we cannot risk that it suffers the same fate as the proposed Constitution last year. It has to have political support, and I hope that we, together, have put in place the appropriate mechanism to ensure that we achieve that result.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Diana Wallis (ALDE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . – Mr President, I welcome very much Mr Leinen’s report, so much so that my own political group will vote against any amendments to it.
