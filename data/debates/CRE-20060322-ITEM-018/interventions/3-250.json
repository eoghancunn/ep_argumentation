{"speaker": "Margot Wallström,", "english": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission . Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Lehne for his report. The Commission wholeheartedly welcomes Parliament’s interest in the common frame of reference – CFR – on contract law and in the review of the consumer acquis . The Commission is happy to see that Parliament shares very similar views regarding the need to deliver a high level of consumer protection in the revision of the consumer acquis .\nParliament considers that the development of the CFR is unpredictable and that the ultimate long-term outcome might be a European code of obligations, or even a full-blown European civil code. I would stress that the Commission, and Commissioner Kyprianou personally, has clearly and repeatedly stated that it has no intention of producing a European civil code. The Commission’s view is that the CFR will be a better law-making toolbox for achieving coherence when revising existing legislation and adopting new instruments in the area of contract law, particularly consumer contract law, on which the currency of our work has been refocused.\nThe legal form of this instrument, and if and to what extent it could be binding, has yet to be decided. If the Commission considers that this toolbox will be of more than internal use for the Commission, such a decision would clearly be a political decision and would need to be taken by the Commission, Parliament and the Council.\nThe Commission understands fully that Parliament wants to be kept informed of and involved in the ongoing work on the CFR. We therefore welcome Parliament’s involvement in the CFR process, in particular the creation of the working party. The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way. Commissioner Kyprianou will discuss regularly with Parliament’s relevant committees the progress of CFR work and, in particular the intermediate politically relevant steps.\nI would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its encouragement and support for our work on this important dossier.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission .
