        "1.  Reiterates its conviction, expressed in its resolutions of 26 May 1989[1], 6 May 1994[2], 15 November 2001[3]and 2 September 2003[4], that a uniform internal market cannot be fully functional without further steps towards the harmonisation of civil law;\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Commission to exploit straight away,in its revision of the acquis in the field of consumer protection,the ongoing work by the research groups on the drafting of European contract law, and by the Network for a common frame of reference, with a view to using the results towards developing a commoncivil law; Substantive law issues\n",
        "3.  Strongly recommends that the proposed common frame of reference and the envisaged contract law should not be designed in such a way as to unilaterally favour one restricted group of participants in legal transactions;\n",
        "4.  Reminds the Commission that the term \"business\" covers more than just large corporations and includes small - even one-person - undertakings which will often require contracts that are specially tailored to their needs and that take account of their relative vulnerability when contracting with large corporations;\n",
        "5.  Notes that the law to be developed must be applicable not only to business-to-business legal transactions but also to business-to-consumer legal transactions;\n",
        "6.  Calls on the Commission to distinguish, where necessary, between legal provisions applicable to the business-to-business sector and those applicable to the business-to-consumer sector, and to separate the two systematically;\n",
        "7.  Highlights the importance of taking into account the fundamental principle of freedom to conclude a contract, particularly in the business-to-business sector;\n",
        "8.  Highlights the importance of taking into account the European social model when harmonising contract law;\n",
        "9.  Calls for differing legal traditions and systems to be respected;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission, in its future proposals, to define adequately and precisely how those proposals will interact with the Community rules on the conflict of laws and with national legal systems, in particular as regards the conditions determining the validity of a choice of applicable law, the mandatory rules and the role of the lex fori;\n",
        "11. Notes that with over-detailed legal provisions on individual aspects of contract law there is a danger of being unable to react flexibly to altered legal circumstances, and therefore favours the adoption of general regulations including legal concepts which are not precisely defined, thus giving the courts the necessary margin of discretion in arriving at their judgments;\n",
        "12. Asks the Commission to conduct a thorough legal and economic impact assessment for all legislative measures concerning civil law; Procedural issues\n",
        "13. Welcomes the Commission's First Annual Progress Report and endorses its thoughtful and measured approach to the revision of the consumer protectionacquis; 14 Calls for the Commission as a whole, under the primary responsibility of the Justice,Freedom and Security DG andwith the involvement of the Internal Market and Services and theHealth and Consumer ProtectionDGs in particular, to participate in this work, and for the material and human resources which are necessary – given the importance and extent of the project – to be made available;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission to submit without delay a clear legislative plan setting out the future legal instruments by which it aims to bring the results of the work of the research groups and the CFR-Net[5]into use in legal transactions;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament a formal plan for the incremental consultation of Parliament as the work progresses, and for the ultimate implementation of the results of the work of the researchers and the CFR-Net;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the results obtained by the Network are adequately taken into account in the work of the research groups;\n",
        "18. Supports the Commission in its efforts at better law-making, but emphasises that the work done by researchers in developing the CFR must follow clear guidelines laid down by the EU legislature;\n",
        "19. Asks the Commission to assist clarification of the research and stakeholder processes by the production of an organisational diagram and/or flow chart which clearly identifies all the different groups, working groups, parties and so on which are involved, thereby indicating their role and position in the processes;\n",
        "20. Considers it desirable for the Commission, on the basis of the researchers’ final report, to submit the various possible legal options to the Parliament, and recalls that the CFR can only finally be adopted following political approval by the Parliament and the Council;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to keep Parliament continually informed, at least in quarterly reports, of the results obtained and progress of the work of the research groups and of the Network;\n",
        "22. Requires at least the following three kinds of information to appear in the quarterly reports: (a) a summary of the most important results of the workshops held so far, (b) reactions of the research groups, and (c) a statement by the Commission on the way in which it proposes to take account of these results in its subsequent work;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commissiontoact in the closest possible cooperation with the Parliament in every step taken towards developing a CFR; is of the opinion that Parliament should be formally consulted first on the draft structure and subsequently on each title or section of the CFR (depending on its final structure) as it is finalised, before it is ultimately consulted on the final instrument;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission to consult Parliament before taking any further planning measures;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission to allow the network of representatives of practice-based interests more time to prepare and discuss the complex substance of the work of the CFR-Net workshops;\n",
        "26. Urges that the organisations which appear on behalf of the interest groups in the CFR-Net be able to decide for themselves which representatives take part in the meetings;\n",
        "27. Instructs its Committee on Legal Affairs and its committees asked for their opinions on European contract law to continually follow the work of the Commission, the research groups and the Network and, where appropriate, to issue opinions on the results regularly issued by the Commission;\n",
        "28. Urges each Council Presidency to organise a forum in cooperation with the Commission and the European Parliament in which the progress and results of the procedure may be presented and discussed;\n",
        "29. In order to give this ambitious and long-term project the visibility and attention which it warrants, undertakes to reflect carefully on how it should best be dealt with in Parliament itself, and accordingly suggests the setting-up of a parliamentary project team which should be properly resourced in order to deal with this long-term project over the period of the current parliamentary term and which should reflect the enhanced cooperation procedure between committees;\n",
        "30. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
