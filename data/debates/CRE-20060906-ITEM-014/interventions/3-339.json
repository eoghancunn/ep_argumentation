{"speaker": "Simon Coveney (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Simon Coveney (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, for his work in considering the raft of amendments linked to this report. It has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report, because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered. The final result needs to be a balanced one that reflects the developing, positive relationship between two huge economic blocs while not shying away from the real and difficult concerns that exist on issues of human rights and the promotion of democracy; issues which we in Parliament claim to be serious about.\nI am strongly in favour of continuing to develop a closer relationship with China. The EU is China’s largest trading partner, after all, and it is our second-largest trading partner. Massive economic opportunities exist for both parties to grow and take advantage of new markets. Therefore, anyone who advocates the isolation of China as a foreign policy strategy, for whatever reason, is being unrealistic.\nThat being said, however, we must be firm and consistent in our efforts to ensure that with the developing trade relationship must also come democratic development and an increased respect for human rights. The two must go hand-in-hand. That is why, as a human rights spokesperson, I am so glad to see such a strong emphasis on human rights concerns in this report.\nI was relieved to hear Mrs De Keyser clarify that the PSE Group’s objections are not based on concerns over the references to human rights issues; but that was until I heard what Mr Ford had to say. The report is certainly not dominated by human rights concerns, but it does ask the hard questions, and rightly so, if we are to be taken seriously by China in relation to human rights issues, such as the need to guarantee genuine religious freedom; the concern at reports of widespread torture in Chinese prisons and reports of inhumane, degrading treatment and internment without trial; the laogai system of detention centres and labour camps; forced compliance with family planning policy; censorship of the internet and recent reports of sourcing human organs from prisoners. I was delighted to hear the Commissioner make a very strong statement in relation to that issue. In fact, I would congratulate her on her very balanced presentation this evening.\nThese are serious concerns that demand our attention as we proceed to develop the closer relationship with China that we all accept is inevitable and desirable.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Coveney (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, for his work in considering the raft of amendments linked to this report.
