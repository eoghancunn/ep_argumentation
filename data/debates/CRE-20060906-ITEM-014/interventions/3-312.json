{"speaker": "Alexandra Dobolyi (PSE). –", "english": "Alexandra Dobolyi (PSE). – Mr President, my group has requested that Mr Belder’s report on EU-China relations be referred back to committee because we consider it to be inadequate and unbalanced in addressing a number of issues covering relations between the EU and China. The PSE Group also believes that there are a number of factual errors in the report which could only be corrected via a huge number of amendments. However, we are of the opinion that such an important report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning a global power like China needs to be re-examined and re-discussed in detail. This is because the report contains 125 recitals and paragraphs, of which only two paragraphs are on EU-China cooperation. Just 13 paragraphs concern foreign policy, while some of the EU’s basic principles of the last 30 years are ignored. Global security and energy issues are barely mentioned, and therefore we need to bring balance into this report.\nWe urge the House to refer this report back to committee, where we will have sufficient time to address these extremely important issues as regards EU-China cooperation.\nThe Commission is currently doing a tremendous job in dealing with EU-China relations in more than 20 different policy fields, including foreign policy, global security issues and energy issues. We need to act together to define a coherent position based on facts and clear information from the relevant departments in the Commission and the Council. Parliament’s position will be greatly strengthened and we will be more influential in achieving our common goals if we give ourselves some extra time to prepare and reflect on this report again.\n(Applause from the PSE Group)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexandra Dobolyi (PSE). – Mr President, my group has requested that Mr Belder’s report on EU-China relations be referred back to committee because we consider it to be inadequate and unbalanced in addressing a number of issues covering relations between the EU and China.
