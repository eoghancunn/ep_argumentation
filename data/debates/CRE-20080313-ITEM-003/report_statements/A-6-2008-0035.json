        "1.  Welcomes the Commission Communication which it regards as a further step in the Programme of Action for the Mainstreaming of Gender Equality in Community Development Cooperation for the period 2001 to 2006;\n",
        "2.  Deplores the fact that, since the Council, in its resolution of 20 December 1995, first declared consideration of the gender perspective in development cooperation to be a principle underpinning the development policy of the Community and the Member States, not enough has been done in practice; 3   Points out that people's understanding of the role of women in post-war societies and of their contributions to post-war reconstruction must go beyond the universalistic narrative of \"women's experience of war\" and that the specificity and diversity of women's experiences must be acknowledged;\n",
        "4.  Deplores the fact that most DCI Country Strategy Papers refer to gender as a cross-cutting area, without indicating any specific gender-related targets or activities; strongly calls for gender-specific targets and activities to be included in future strategies;\n",
        "5.  Welcomes the Commission’s call for the EU to support third countries in complying with and implementing international obligations, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), the Cairo Programme of Action (1994 and 2004), the Beijing Platform of Action (1999 and 2005), and the Declaration of the Millennium Development Goals (2000);\n",
        "6.  Endorses the Commission’s view that the funding made available to support the integration of gender equality issues into development cooperation is insignificant when compared with the resources earmarked for other horizontal measures; regrets that only 5% of the DCI funds for the thematic programme 'Investing in People (2007-2013)' are allocated to gender equality and that regional and country strategy papers do not give an overview of budget allocation to gender equality since gender is only mentioned as a cross-cutting issue and thus no financial details are provided;\n",
        "7.  Expresses concern regarding the Commission's new aid architecture, which gives preference to budget support, since this can bring additional difficulties in the assessment of gender equality progress;\n",
        "8.  Commends the general approach of the Commission as a good basis on which the EU and Member States could factor gender issues into their development cooperation programmes in order to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women as the main instrument for enhancing human rights and combating poverty, but notes that there is room for improvement, especially inthe analysis of data, so that measures which could hamper the position of women can be avoided;\n",
        "9.  Believes that the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming in development cooperation policies depends on sensitivity to gender issues on the part of the Member States and EU institutions involved; believes that this implies that achieving the goals in  the Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010 (COM(2006)0092) within the EUis a necessary pre-condition for efficient gender mainstreaming in development cooperation;\n",
        "10. Stresses the need to focus not only on women, but also on gender relations, especially social relations between men and women that generate and perpetuate gender inequalities; believes that as a consequence, projects should target men as well as women;\n",
        "11. Emphasises that globalisation processes should offer poor countries new opportunities and take into account women's specific needs, as women are often unskilled workers and therefore, socially disadvantaged;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission to put forward practical proposals as to how,in the context of an increasingly globalised world,jobs and livelihoods can be created for the large numbers of unskilled women in developing countries;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take action in development cooperation with concrete and measurable effects on gender relations, amending laws, institutions and existing patriarchal patterns, increasing budgetary resources and improving social and economic conditions for women;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Member States and the Commission, as employers in developing countries, to take account of the principle of work consistent with human dignity by increasing wages in accordance with Recommendation 135 of the International Labour Organisation concerning minimum wage fixing, with special reference to developing countries;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the proposals to promote the protection of the labour and civil rights of casual workers and to promote the participation of women in trade union movements in order to better mitigate the difficulties women face at work;\n",
        "16. Urges the Commission, when drawing up development cooperationpolicies, to support measures to strengthen the legal status of women, further promoting equal access to decent work as well as fundamental human and social rights, and paying particular attention to the increasing number of migrant women and their increasing vulnerability, so that women do not become the new exploited class of society;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the potential effect of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) from the gender perspective;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure coherence between development cooperation policy and other Community policies (such as trade policy and agriculture policy) in order to prevent adverse inter-policy interference, especially as regards measures designed to empower women;\n",
        "19. Points out that the ability of women to influence the development of their own lives is contingent on their education; emphasises the importance of gender-sensitive education programmes targeting both women and men;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to undertake a gender analysis at every stage of policy design, implementation and evaluation so as to ensure that all forms of gender-based discrimination are eliminated and so as to protect and promote women’s human rights;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to develop an assessment of the consequences that the new aid modalities have had on the situation of women, taking into account the fact that the focus on women and gender equality has lessened, partly as a result of this new development trend;\n",
        "22. Welcomes the Commission's call for gender sensitive performance indicators to be developed and calls for the inclusion of such indicators in all DCI and European Development Fund Country Strategy Papers as well as in the assessment of outcomes during mid-term and final reviews of such strategies; calls on the Commission to develop low cost, transparent and readily interpretable parameters in the form of quantitatively measurable and qualitative indicators so that it can assess progress towards equality and the empowerment for women regularly and effectively; invites the Commission to raise  in dialogues with third countries awareness of the importance of gender-aggregated and comparable data; supports the gender disaggregated indicators in Annex VII as a good basis to develop a comprehensive instruments to measure results;\n",
        "23. Welcomes the fact that the Commission's strategy takes into account the phenomenon of gender-based violence;\n",
        "24. Stresses that violence against women is not only a women’s issue and that it needs an approach that focuses on men as well as on women; while welcoming programmes addressing female victims, urges the Commission and the Member States to develop programmes addressing male abusers, thus addressing the causes and not merely the effects of this phenomenon;\n",
        "25. Welcomes the Commission’s initiative of raising awareness of violence against women by means of increased media coverage of this issue and the training of military, law-enforcement and judicial personnel; urges, however, that more attention be paid to measures targeting trafficking in human beings, torture and harmful traditional practices, with an emphasis on female genital mutilation, honour crimes and early and forced marriage, and insists on increasing the number of female personnel in institutions which directly assist victims of these practices.\n",
        "26. Welcomes the express link between women and HIV (in terms of increasing rate of infection) spelt out in the abovementioned Commission Communication on gender equality and women empowerment in development cooperation; believes that  an express call to Members States to meet the financial commitments they have made in this field should have been conducted;\n",
        "27. Invites the Commission and the Member States to develop specific, time-bound and measurable commitments ― backed by the allocation ofadequate resources ― to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for all women and girls by 2010;\n",
        "28. Welcomes the strong reaffirmation of the linkage between HIV/AIDS policies and programmes and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) policies and services in the abovementioned Commission Communication on gender equality and women empowerment in development cooperation;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Commission to strengthen its political leadership role in SRHR policies and to increase funding for SRHR, in order to help countries to achieve the MDGs, in particular the goal of universal access to reproductive health under the MDG on improving maternal health (MDG 5), and to address currently neglected women’s SRHR issues, such as obstetric and traumatic fistula;\n",
        "30. Points out that the discrimination suffered by women and girls serves to increase their risk of contracting HIV, since their low social status makes it difficult for them to take their own decisions on matters relating to sexuality;\n",
        "31. Deplores in the strongest possible terms the virtual chattel status of women trapped under Sharia Law, and regards this oppression as representing the diametric opposite of every principle this Report holds to be of paramount importance;\n",
        "32. Welcomes the fact that the Commission Communication recognises the importance of supporting research into microbicides and vaccines (which are the most promising technologies for women) and calls on the EU to further ensure the inclusion of AIDS vaccine and Microbicides Research and Development within the broader development and gender equality agendas;\n",
        "33. Considers that empowering women by ensuring full access to sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies puts them in a better position to negotiate safe sex and protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV; supports the measures proposed by the Commission to protect women from STDs, especially the financial support for the development of microbicides and vaccines and the measures proposed relating to reproductive health and rights;\n",
        "34. Encourages the Member States to promote the inclusion of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) within the package of comprehensive approaches to combating HIV;\n",
        "35. Emphasises the importance of putting women at the centre of water supply, sanitation and hygiene and emphasises, therefore, the importance of increasing access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and water for productive uses;\n",
        "36. Criticises strongly the fact that measures to combat traditional practices involving violence against women are not part of the Commission’s strategy; condemns any legal, cultural and religious practices that discriminate against women, exclude them from political  and public life and segregate them in their daily lives, as well as those that condone rape, domestic violence, forced marriage, unequal rights in divorce proceedings, honour killings, any obligation against the woman's own will to observe specific dress codes, harassment for not conforming to gender-related norms or rules, trafficking and forced labour; urges the Commission and Member States to combat these practices in development cooperation policies; calls on the Commission to make strenuous efforts to support information and advocacy programmes that raise public awareness and change the climate of public opinion in country programming and to make the measures that are taken to fight against all forms of violence against women, including traditional harmful practices, a criteria of good governance of partner countries;\n",
        "37. Notes with alarm the Report of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on the State of the World Population last year, which admits there is a global deficit of 60 000 000 women in the world, and that these ‘missing’ females have been prenatally sex-selected, aborted, and infanticised out of existence;\n",
        "38. Calls on the Commission and  Member States to implement the Brussels Call to Action to Address Sexual Violence in Conflict and Beyond;\n",
        "39. Urges the Commission to make sexual and reproductive health and rights in crises and conflict areas, including the fight against sexual violence, a priority in the humanitarian phase as well as in post-war reconstruction;\n",
        "40. Stresses the need to complement the image of women as vulnerable victims with an image of women as a highly differentiated group of social actors, who possess valuable resources and capacities and who have their own agendas; women influence the course of things, and they must shape the development process;\n",
        "41. Considers that the participation of women in decision-making processes at all levels is a necessary condition for good governance and welcomes all kinds of support measures, such as incentives to meet quotas,  support for women’s movements and organisations and the active promotion of women’s rights in the Country Strategy Papers; reiterates the need to increase the role of women in political decision-making and to ensure the full participation and involvement of women in all efforts for the promotion of peace and conflict resolution; furthermore supports the recommendations of UNSCR 1325 (2000);\n",
        "42. Calls on the EU to increase efforts aimed at implementing UNSCR 1325 (2000), which calls for an increased participation of women at all decision-making levels in conflict resolution and peace processes;\n",
        "43. Stresses that rape has been used as a weapon of war and that this phenomenon needs to be addressed through support programmes for victims;\n",
        "44. Calls on the Commission to make strenuous efforts to take full account of gender equality in country programming; stresses that considerable work is still needed to incorporate gender equality as a horizontal task into the day-to-day practice of EU development cooperation; calls on the Commission to pursue gender balance within Commission delegations by appointing more women , including in top positions such as Head of Delegation;\n",
        "45. Emphasises the potential of micro-credit as a tool that development cooperation policies can use to promote the development of local communities and women's empowerment;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Commission to develop policies that encourage women to form self help groups and set up on their ownand, in collaboration with international organisations (such as Finance PlaNet), to expand the microfinance network so that more women can take out loans in order to improve their economic status;\n",
        "47. Calls on the Commission to provide clear information on available mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the present strategy, including monitoring the financial and human resources that will be allocated to ensure effective implementation;\n",
        "48. Points out that at national level, gender equality is more likely to be achieved if there are sufficient financial resources and qualified gender equality specialists, especially local specialists, as part of project teams;\n",
        "49. Urges the Commission to give their staff members working in development countries training in gender issues;\n",
        "50. Welcomes the measures proposed by the Commission in the field of education, considering that women's empowerment through an increased level of education improves the situation of both women and their children;\n",
        "51. Stresses the need to further promote access to education and vocational training at all levels for girls, in order to prevent early 'dropout' and to support education policies that are equitable and of a high standard, by providing teachers with training in gender issues and supporting reform of the curriculum to include gender equality, sexual and reproductive health and women's empowerment issues, as in a majority of developing countries girls continue to face discrimination with regard to access to schooling;\n",
        "52. Points out that the strategy in the area of EU actions at international and regional level regrettably includes no EU stance on the reform of the UN in the area of gender equality;\n",

        "55. Welcomes the Commission’s intention to link the disbursement of budget support funds to performance criteria assessed on the basis of gender-disaggregated outcome indicators; insists, however, that decisions penalising incompetent administrative authorities must be carefully taken in order not to affect adversely the final beneficiaries of aid, namely women;\n",
        "56. Emphasises that participation alone does not serve to reduce women’s inequality, but that only targeted, effective efforts on the ground can overcome all the obstacles to women’s participation;\n",
        "57. Points out that good governance includes respect for fundamental freedoms and treating women's rights and gender equality as basic fundamental rights and that these are central to achieving the MDGs and other development goals,\n",
