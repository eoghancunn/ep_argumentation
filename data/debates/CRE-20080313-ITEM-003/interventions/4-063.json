The reality is stated in the explanatory statement, for example in Africa, where women make up 52% of the population but perform 75% of the agricultural work and produce and market up to 80% of food. I think the role of women in development in terms of food production is often ignored.\nBut I do take exception to the paragraph in the explanatory statement, which is historic and not up to date, in relation to a comment it makes about the common agricultural policy, which I absolutely disagree with. Europe is the largest importer of produce from the developing world. We have the Everything But Arms agreement and we will soon, perhaps, have a world trade agreement. But I think we need, as the World Bank says, to invest again in agriculture and food production, and we need to do that through women.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak on this because, in the heat of the debate, I think I want to bring matters down to a more practical level.
