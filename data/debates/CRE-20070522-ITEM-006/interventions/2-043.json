{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to make three points. The first is to thank Mr Caspary for doing an excellent job on this report and to congratulate him on continuing a good, free-trade, liberal line.\nMy second point is that I am a supporter of free trade and multilateralism. However, I understand that in the current Doha Round we have to take some measures, which we do not necessarily like, on the line of bilateralism, but we have to stick to it.\nI should like to say to Mr Mandelson that it is very good that he is promoting us as a superpower in trade: over 20% of world trade is with us, 20% with the US. When we talk on trade people listen, and that is why it is very important to find a balance between free trade and protectionism.\nOn the trade defence instrument itself, I am a bit iffy – for example, I like Chinese tennis shoes! – and therefore I should like the Commissioner to be careful about that and not push it too far. We do not want to become a European Colbert state.\nMy final point concerns globalisation, in particular the sales of globalisation. I am very saddened when I listen to the likes of Jean-Marie Le Pen – which I do not do very often. It seems as if globalisation has become the scapegoat for everything: everything that is bad is thanks to globalisation and everything that is good is thanks to the Member State itself. This is the wrong way to approach things. I really do not want the European Union to become a modern Colbert, in other words, a mercantilist, which believes in its own exports but wants to prevent imports from elsewhere. That is not what we are about: our basic line is about the free movement of goods, services, people and money, and we need to promote that worldwide as well.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to make three points.
