{"speaker": "Godfrey Bloom (IND/DEM). -", "english": "Godfrey Bloom (IND/DEM). - Mr President, there is enormous discrimination against women in the United Kingdom, sadly. I know my own committee – the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – have their heart in the right place. However, most of the discrimination comes because the employment laws are so onerous for small businesses recruiting young women that they simply discriminate in a covert way.\nI think it is the classic law of unintended consequence. You make a law here, you make a law there, and what actually happens is that nothing happens, which actually reinforces the position.\nI do not mean to sound ungallant, but when I look round my committee – the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – I see that their mindset is deeply locked in the 1970s – they have not moved on. I am afraid that life is not like that any more, and when I hear people talk about the emancipation of women, I am sorry, but as an Englishman, that happened a very long time ago. I do not know what problems other countries have, but please do not lay all this on the United Kingdom, where we do not have the problem, because, although, again, I say your heart is in the right place (the law of unintended consequences), you are making a real bollocks of it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Godfrey Bloom (IND/DEM). - Mr President, there is enormous discrimination against women in the United Kingdom, sadly.
