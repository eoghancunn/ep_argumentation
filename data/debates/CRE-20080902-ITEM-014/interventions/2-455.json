I also thank the Commissioner for the comments he made. One particular point I wish to pick up on is the whole question of trafficking. As a representative from London – and, indeed, a woman representative from London – I have had a particular interest in this subject, because London is one of the places very much affected by trafficking in women.\nMember States are currently being asked to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking. Although some of the Member States have signed this, there are others – 15, in fact – that have not yet signed, and indeed there are two that do not seem prepared to do so.
