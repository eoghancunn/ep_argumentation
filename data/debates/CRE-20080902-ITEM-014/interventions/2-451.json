{"speaker": "Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL). -", "english": "Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL). - (PT) Mr President, evidence shows that discrimination against women persists and ultimately affects women workers, whose wages are on average over 15% lower than men’s. In some countries, including Portugal, this figure rises to over 25%, a situation that has actually become aggravated in recent years.\nWe therefore call for the upgrading of employment, decent wages, compliance with social, health and safety standards and a reduction in the working day without loss of pay. This could help to create more jobs with rights for women and ensure better reconciliation of work and family life.\nThe adoption of measures to combat the labour precariousness that affects women in particular and to enhance collective bargaining in defending male and female workers must be encouraged. The adoption of public measures and actions to improve women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services and to raise their awareness of their rights and the public services available to them must also be encouraged, while respecting their dignity.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL). - (PT) Mr President, evidence shows that discrimination against women persists and ultimately affects women workers, whose wages are on average over 15% lower than men’s.
