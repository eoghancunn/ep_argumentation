    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Recognises the influence of lobby groups on EU decision-making and therefore considers it essential that Members of Parliament should know the identity of the organisations represented by lobby groups; emphasises that transparent and equal access to all the EU institutions is an absolute prerequisite for the Union's legitimacy and trust among its citizens; stresses that transparency is a two-way street that is needed both in the work of the institutions themselves and among the lobbyists; stresses that equal access for lobby groups to the EU institutions increases the expertise available for running the Union; considers it essential that representatives of civil society have access to the EU institutions, first and foremost to Parliament;\n",
        "2.  Considers that its Members have a responsibility on their own part to ensure that they receive balanced information; stresses that its Members must be deemed capable of making political decisions independently of lobbyists;\n",
        "3.  Acknowledges that a rapporteur may, as he or she sees fit (on a voluntary basis), use a \"legislative footprint\", i.e. an indicative list (attached to Parliament's reports) of registered interest representatives who were consulted, and had significant input, during the preparation of the report; considers it particularly advisable that such list be included in legislative reports; stresses, nevertheless, that it is even more important for the Commission to attach such \"legislative footprint\" to its legislative initiatives;\n",
        "4.  Maintains that Parliament must decide entirely independently to what extent it will take account of opinions originating from civil society;\n",
        "5.  Notes the current rules under which its Members are required to declare their financial interests; invites its Bureau, on the basis of a proposal from the Quaestors, to draw up a plan to further improve the implementation and monitoring of Parliaments' rules under which a Member must declare any support which he or she receives, whether financial or in terms of staff or materials[5];\n",
        "6.  Notes the current rules on Intergroups which require declarations of funding; calls for further clarity in relation to Intergroups, i.e. a list of all existing, registered and non-registered Intergroups on Parliament's website, including full declaration of outside support for the activities of Intergroups as well as a statement of the intergroup's broad aims; stresses, however, that Intergroups shall in no way be considered organs of Parliament;\n",
        "7.  Calls for the Bureau, based on a proposal by the Quaestors, to look into ways of restricting unauthorised access to the levels on which its Members' offices are situated in Parliament's buildings, whereas access to committee rooms by the public should be limited only in exceptional circumstances;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes the Commission's proposal for a more structured framework for the activities of the interest representatives as a part of the European Transparency Initiative;\n",
        "9.  Agrees with the Commission's definition of lobbying as \"activities carried out with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions\"; considers this definition to be in line with Rule 9(4) of its Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "10. Emphasises that all actors, including both public and private interest representatives, outside the EU institutions falling within that definition and regularly influencing the institutions should be considered lobbyists and treated in the same way: professional lobbyists, companies' in-house lobbyists, NGOs, think-tanks, trade associations, trade unions and employers' organisations, profit-making and non-profit organisations  and lawyers when their purpose is to influence policy rather than case-law; stresses also, however, that regions and municipalities of the Member States, as well as political parties at national and European level and those bodies which have legal status under the Treaties do not fall within the scope of these rules when they are acting in accordance with the role, and carrying out the tasks of such bodies, as provided for in the Treaties;\n",
        "11. Welcomes in principle the Commission's proposal for a \"one-stop shop\" where lobbyists could register with both the Commission and Parliament and calls for an interinstitutional agreement on a common mandatory register between the Council, the Commission and Parliament that would be applicable in all institutions and include full financial disclosure, a common mechanism of expulsion from the register and a common code of ethical behaviour; recalls, however, the essential differences between the Council, the Commission and Parliament as institutions; reserves, therefore, the right to evaluate the Commission's proposal when it is finalised and, only then, to decide on whether or not to support it;\n",
        "12. Recalls that the number of lobbyists who have access to Parliament must remain reasonable; suggests, therefore, the adoption of a system under which lobbyists need register only once with all institutions and each institution may decide whether to grant access to its premises, thus allowing Parliament to continue to limit the number of badges provided to each organisation/company to four;\n",
        "13. Calls for mutual recognition between the Council, the Commission and Parliament of separate registers in the event that a common register is not achieved; suggests that, in the absence of arrangements by the institutions for a common register, their individual web-based registers should include links to the other registers in order to enable comparison of lobbyists' entries; calls on the Secretary General to move Parliament's list of representatives of accredited interest groups to a more easily accessible location on Parliament's website;\n",
        "14. Proposes that a joint working group of Council representatives, Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament, appointed by the Conference of Presidents, will be set up promptly, with the aim of considering, by the end of the year 2008, the implications of a common register for all lobbyists who wish to have access to the Council, to the Commission or to Parliament and the elaboration of a Common Code of Conduct; instructs its Secretary General to take the appropriate steps;\n",
        "15. Urges the Council to join a possible common register; is of the opinion that careful consideration needs to be given to the activities of lobbyists vis-à-vis the Council Secretariat in the context of codecision matters;\n",
        "16. Notes the Commission's decision to start with a voluntary register and to evaluate the system after one year, but is concerned that a purely voluntary system will allow less responsible lobbyists to avoid compliance; calls on the three institutions to review the rules governing the activities of lobbyists at the latest three years after a common register enters into force, in order to evaluate if the changed system is achieving the necessary transparency on lobbyists' activities; is aware of the legal basis for a mandatory register provided by the Treaty of Lisbon and decides in the meantime to cooperate with the institutions by way of an interinstitutional agreement on the basis of the existing registers; considers that mandatory registration should be a requirement for lobbyists who wish to have regular access to the institutions, as is already de facto the case in Parliament;\n",
        "17. Considers that, since lobbying practices continue to evolve over time, any rules regulating such practices must be flexible enough to adapt swiftly to change;\n",
        "18. Notes the Commission's draft Code of Conduct for interest representatives; reminds the Commission that Parliament has already had such a code for over 10 years and asks the Commission to negotiate with Parliament for the establishment of common rules; is of the opinion that any code should ensure a strong monitoring element with regard to the conduct of lobbyists; stresses that sanctions should apply to lobbyists who breach the code of conduct; emphasises that sufficient resources (staff and funding) must be set aside for the purposes of verifying the information in the register; considers that for the Commission's register sanctions may include the suspension from the register, in more serious cases removal from the register; believes that once a common register is established, misbehaviour of lobbyists should lead to sanctions in relation to access to all institutions to which the register applies;\n",
        "19. Emphasises the need for the register to be user friendly and easily accessible on the Internet: the public must be able to easily find and search the register, and it must include not only the names of the lobbying organisations but also the name of the lobbyists themselves;\n",
        "20. Stresses that the register should contain separate categories in which lobbyists should be registered according to the type of interests they represent (e.g. professional associations, company representatives, trade unions, employers' organisations, lawyers' offices, NGOs, etc.);\n",
        "21. Welcomes the Commission's decision to request that the requirement of financial disclosure by interest representatives joining the register apply to the following:\n",
        "22. Stresses that the requirement of financial disclosure must apply equally to all registered interest representatives;\n",
        "23. Asks the working group to propose specific criteria which would invoke the requirement for financial disclosure, for example an indication of lobbying expenditure within meaningful parameters (exact figures not necessary);\n",
        "24. Calls on the committee responsible to prepare any necessary amendments to Parliament's Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
