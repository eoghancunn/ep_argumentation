Mr President, I would just like to say that Adam Gierek’s report comes just in time.\n(NL) … in view of the new and very hefty challenge we are facing at world level. Globalisation is pricing us out of the market, while some sectors of our traditional manufacturing industry are leaving it, and Mr Aho’s much-discussed report calls for more clustering, a more critical stance among the public, more specialisation and for harnessing creativity.\nIn the Union, we spend about 43% of the Budget on reinforcing our competitiveness in the form of structural funds, money for research and money for the small and medium-sized enterprises. My question remains whether we, with these instruments, are taking due account of competitive relations. What do we do if it eventually transpires that we have an insufficient number of technically trained people to carry out various jobs?\nGlobally, it appears that we do not focus enough, while in Europe, we do not dare bring certain things into profile via knowledge regions of all kinds. As I see it, open innovation for large and small companies, together with knowledge institutions and governments are the answer to this.\nIn the final analysis, we need top regions. This is about a top sport, as Mr Verheugen also pointed out. This is about wanting to be a leader in technology. Without a leader, there is no following. In this case, there is insufficient scope for cohesion policy to be deployed across Europe, including the less developed areas.\nI think we need to be bold enough to re-calibrate our policy in the next few years. We need more focus.
