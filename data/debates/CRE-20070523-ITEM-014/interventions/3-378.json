I am also pleased that it welcomes the proposal for a Risk-Sharing Finance Facility and recognises the problems associated with protecting innovation in services, most notably smaller businesses’ difficulties with trade secrets and confidentiality agreements, which can hinder their ability to raise finance.\nIt is clearly true that intellectual property is intimately related to innovation. However, I am sorry to see statements in the report that are pre-emptive of the work that is going on within the Commission under the auspices of Commissioner McCreevy on various ways to improve the patent system.\nThe approach of that work is pragmatic and constructive and may offer better solutions, for example, than trying to integrate the European Patent Office into the Community, which is by no means a simple solution, nor most likely to resolve most of the outstanding problems. It is certainly not something that could be achieved rapidly.\nInnovation, intellectual property and competitiveness are part of globalisation, where international norms are important.
