I dare say, however, that many Members in this House are not giving this committee the importance that it deserves, and this should change.\nIf EU citizenship means anything, surely it must mean that citizens of Europe can stand up for their rights and make their voices heard, regardless of whether they stand up against companies, local or regional authorities, public agencies or even their own national governments. This right can best be exercised through the use of the petition to the European Parliament – a right that is recognised as a basic right in the Treaty. Provided that their complaint concerns rights under EU law, people can rely on Europe and on us, as representatives of Europeans, to support them.\nThe petition is a great tribute, I would say, to Europe and what it stands for, but it is also a great credit to Member States, because Member States themselves signed a Treaty which gave the right to petition, even if the petition can often be used as a tool against Member State authorities themselves. So I strongly urge EU citizens to stand up for their rights, to use the petition as a tool to defend themselves on EU rights. Those who will do so will surely find us standing right there behind them.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Busuttil (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, on his excellent report.\nHaving been a member of the Committee on Petitions myself since the beginning of this year, I too have to admit that I am becoming a keen supporter of this committee and the importance of its role.
