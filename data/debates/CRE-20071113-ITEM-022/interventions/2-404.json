{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, I consider the Committee on Petitions one of the most valuable committees in Parliament, if not the most valuable. It is the form in which the citizens tell us how the many laws we tinker with in other committees affect them or do not affect them. Without this feedback we are doomed to work in a vacuum. But, in terms of doing our work properly, there is something missing in the procedure: the Council and the Permanent Representation of the Member States. How can we get results for a citizen in dispute with their country without that country being represented in the Petitions Committee?\nThe second thing I want to mention is a particular petition. The people of Ireland came to the Petitions Committee, with three petitions in all, in connection with our most important sensitive archaeological site: Tara, the home of the High Kings and of St Patrick. The Petitions Committee has responded and has asked for the destruction to stop. The Commission has brought a case against the Irish authorities and yet, by the time anything happens, there will be a motorway, probably there for already three or four years, and all the destruction will have happened. The Irish people will not get over their disillusionment.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, I consider the Committee on Petitions one of the most valuable committees in Parliament, if not the most valuable.
