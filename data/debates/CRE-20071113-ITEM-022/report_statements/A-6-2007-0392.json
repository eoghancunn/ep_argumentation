        "2.  Emphasises the major contribution made by the Committee on Petitions to the work of the European Parliament aimed at reconnecting with the citizens of the EU and reinforcing the legitimacy, transparency and accountability of the EU decision-making process;\n",
        "3.  Believes that petitions offer an instrument with which to gauge what the European public expects from the European Union and the extent to which the European Union manages to deliver;\n",
        "4.  Recalls the role of petitions as a tool to enable EU citizens both to signal loopholes in European legislation and to alert the European institutions about any infringement or misapplication thereof;\n",
        "5.  Underlines the opportunity that petitions offer the European Parliament to assess and, where necessary, take action to surmount, ambiguities in the application and implementation of EC law at European, national, regional and local levels;\n",
        "6.  Stresses the importance of cooperation with the Commission in finding appropriate solutions to matters of concern which European citizens bring to the attention of the Committee on Petitions, inasmuch as they reflect the direct impact of EC legislation, policies and activities on individuals;\n",
        "7.  Regrets the widespread failure by Member States to implement Community environmental norms correctly, and considers that there is a need for improved consistency in the monitoring, notably, of respect for the rules of Community law on the protection of biodiversity and on the assessment of the impact of certain public and private projects and plans on the environment;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes the Commission's 23rd Annual Report on monitoring the application of Community Law (COM(2006)0416), which acknowledges the role of the petitions procedure in identifying infringements;\n",
        "9.  Once again requests the Commission to notify decisions on the opening of infringement proceedings as soon as it makes such a decision, and also relevant decisions by the Court of Justice, in particular when Parliament has been petitioned on the issue in question, and observes that the Commission has not followed up on repeated calls by the Committee on Petitions in this area;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Committee on Petitions to notify, in writing and within a short time, its decisions relating to petitions that it considers at its meetings, so as to avoid misunderstandings and false interpretations by the mass media and petitioners;\n",
        "11. Reiterates the importance of coordination in dealing with issues that are subject to both a petition to Parliament and a complaint to the Commission, given that the right to petition is a fundamental right, safeguarded by the Treaty, that Parliament provides a transparent framework for debates, which is a prerequisite for enhanced public accountability, and that in this context primacy must be accorded to the petitions process;\n",
        "12. Restates the Committee on Petitions' concern at the unjustified and excessive amount of time – often spanning several years – which the Commission takes to pursue and conclude infringement proceedings and its dissatisfaction with the frequent examples of non-compliance by Member States with decisions of the Court of Justice; considers that this undermines the credibility of the formulation and coherent application of EC law and that it serves to discredit the objectives of the EU;\n",
        "13. Reaffirms the need for the Commission to make use of the possibility of bringing Member States before the Court of Justice under Article 228 of the EC Treaty, so that fines in the form of lump sums and penalty payments may be imposed whenever Member States delay the implementation of judgments of the Court of Justice in infringement proceedings;\n",
        "14. Welcomes the constant dialogue between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman; points out that the Committee on Petitionssupportedthe Special Reportson the European Schools and on the transparency of the Council's meetings,welcomes the successful resolution brought about by the Commission's handling of complaints alleging an infringement, and supports the Ombudsman's request for an increase in his budget;\n",

        "16. Confirms the need for greater involvement on the part of the Council, as an institution, in the Committee's activities, and encourages its participation in meetings of the Committee at the appropriate level, as stated in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making[5], adopted on 16 December 2003 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission;\n",
        "17. Reiterates the proposal that the Council designate a senior official to coordinate matters related to petitions, given that many petitions touch upon sensitive political issues concerning the transposition by Member States of Community legislation;\n",
        "18. Emphasises once again the key role of the Member States in correctly implementing Community legislation, and underlines that the practical application thereof is decisive for the purposes of increasing the relevance of the European Union for its citizens; stresses the need for enhanced participation by representatives of the Member States and their parliaments in the debates of the Committee on Petitions;\n",
        "19. Welcomes the activity of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society and the contribution made by the members of the Committee on Petitions and its secretariat who have directly participated in its work; considers that the decision to set up that committee as a follow-up to petitions received has enhanced the efforts to ensure the correct application of Community law in all Member States;\n",
        "20. Encourages the practice of sending fact-finding missions pursuant to Rule 192 of its Rules of Procedure to various Member Statesof the EU to investigate issues raised by petitioners as a way to facilitate effective and pragmatic solutions in the interests of the citizen;\n",
        "21. Stresses the significance of those missions in the efforts to improve communication with citizens and to raise awareness in the Member States about the activities of the European Parliament, in general, and of the Committee on Petitions, in particular;\n",
        "22. Emphasises that better understanding of the function of petitions as a tool enabling citizens to seek redress is closely connected to the quality of the information available to the general public in Europe about EC legislation, policies and objectives;\n",
        "23. Notes that, during the second year since the enlargement of the EU to 25 Member States, the number of petitions received by Parliament has remained relatively constant; observes, however, that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007 is likely to produce a considerable number of petitions from the citizens of those countries;\n",
        "24. Welcomes the agreement within the Committee which has led to the increase in its membership to 40 full members, and considers that this is likely to ensure that European citizens and peopleresiding in the territory of the EU obtain an even better understanding of their case in committee, thereby enabling Parliament to respond better to petitioners' expectations;\n",
        "25. Underlines the need to strengthen the Committee's secretariat in order to cover the need for linguistic, legal and political expertise, so that response times may become shorter and investigations more effective, and so that the service which it provides may be equally available to all citizens of the EU;\n",
        "26. Reiterates the need to find the necessary financial resources to continue the development of the E-petition software system, which functions both as a database and as a management tool providing information about the petitions workflow, thus reinforcing the transparency and efficiency of the Committee's activity;\n",
        "27. Requests the Secretary-General to conduct an urgent review of the 'Citizens Portal' on the website of the European Parliament with the objective of enhancing the visibility of the portal relating to the right of petition, and upgrading its presentation in order to ensure its comparability and compatibility with the website of the European Ombudsman which, unlike the Petitions Committee, is concerned specifically with citizens' complaints concerning allegations of maladministration within the EU institutions or bodies;\n",
        "28. Recalls that, since 1998, the European Parliament has called for a review of the 1989 Interinstitutional Agreement on strengthening the right of petition[6]; reiterates its urgent requests for the Council and the Commission to undertake that review with a view to establishing a more effective means of redress and defining a clear and coherent framework for essential cooperation between the institutions in the area concerned;\n",
        "29. Welcomes the decision to conduct a review of the current rules governing the petitions procedure in order to provide clarification regarding the assessment of the admissibility of petitions and to reinforce procedures related to data protection and confidentiality without undermining the essential transparency of the petitions process itself;\n",
        "30. Emphasises the importance of protecting the rights of petitioners, as a fundamental element of the petitions process, and welcomes the consensus within the Committee on handling the outstanding Lloyd's petitions, especially as regards conveying full support to Ms X, whose name has become public against her wish;\n",
