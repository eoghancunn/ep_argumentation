{"speaker": "Neena Gill (PSE). –", "english": "Neena Gill (PSE). – Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs on their work. Despite this effort, however, it cannot be said that Parliament has achieved much as a result of this year’s budgetary procedure. I deplore the fact that the Council has shown a worrying lack of respect for the views of Parliament throughout. We are the only democratically elected institution tasked with promoting the views of EU citizens, so I wonder whether the Council will even bother to respect its commitment to the agreement finally reached with the secondary budgetary arm. I sincerely hope so. I would like very briefly to make a few comments, not just in respect of the 2007 budget, but also bearing in mind the 2008 review.\nFirst, our key ambition for the EU budget is that it must focus on priorities that deliver on the objectives set by us and our leaders. So it is with regret that I note that, although there has been some increase in the programmes, such as the Seventh Framework Research Programme, it is nowhere near the amount requested by the Commission and Parliament.\nThis is an extremely important policy area with a direct impact on the way the EU develops its global economy and how we are seen by the rest of the world. The Council knows this and has very vociferously tried to push the need for an increase in R&D spending. However, we are still at 1.5%. It really is time for the Council to put their money where their mouth is.\nSecondly, if the EU is to be taken seriously as a global player, it must back up its position with the funding necessary to play its role – for example in Asia, which is the largest and most populous continent, with 60% of the global population in some of the world’s poorest countries. Therefore, the continuing trend of reducing resources to that region is a disastrous policy.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill (PSE). – Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs on their work.
