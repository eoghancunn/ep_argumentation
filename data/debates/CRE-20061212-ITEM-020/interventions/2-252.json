{"speaker": "Dalia Grybauskaitė,", "english": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission . Mr President, today we are finalising our work and debates on the 2007 budget. This is very important for all of us because it is the first budget for the ‘new Europe’ of 27 Member States. It is the budget of a new financial framework; it is the budget of new Financial Regulation; it is the budget of a new financial legislative package, which we agreed to start fully from 1 January. So that means that this budget is not only a budget about figures, it is a budget of many things that we have achieved this year together with Parliament and the Council.\nIn our negotiations today’s budget required a huge effort from all sides and huge efforts of compromise. The result was achieved when we met on 21 November in conciliation and finalised in a week. For this package, the Commission always keeps its word and never changes the opinions reached in the conciliation negotiations.\nI would like to thank the whole team that negotiated on Parliament’s side, as well as their staff, for helping us to find the solution, and all Members, especially the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, for helping us to achieve this package. I am talking not only about the package for the 2007 budget, but also the Financial Regulation package. I also want to thank the rapporteur who is not here now, Mr Pittella, who also helped us go through the 2006 budget implementation.\nI would like to say that today the discussion is very important as a final stage for Thursday’s vote and I am very grateful to all who made this day happen. I wish you a good debate and a very fruitful and positive vote on the 2007 budget on Thursday.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Dalia Grybauskaitė, Member of the Commission .
