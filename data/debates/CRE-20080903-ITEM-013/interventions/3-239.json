{"speaker": "Csaba Sándor Tabajdi (PSE). -", "english": "Csaba Sándor Tabajdi (PSE). - (HU) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Flautre on her excellent, balanced report. I can see three cases where the European Union is applying double standards. On the one hand, there are double standards when we weigh up two small countries, of which one opposes us and is hostile and the other declares itself to be pro-Western and pro-Europe. We see double standards between small countries and the bigger powers, Russia and China, because that is when economic interests come into play. And there is a third double standard, which raises the question of our credibility and whether the European Union has the right to criticise third countries with regard to human rights and minority rights when there are some countries in the Union where several hundreds of thousands of people do not have nationality, like two of the Baltic States, or when there is a leading power in the European Union whose constitution still rejects the recognition of regional languages. Thank you for your attention.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Csaba Sándor Tabajdi (PSE). - (HU) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Flautre on her excellent, balanced report.
