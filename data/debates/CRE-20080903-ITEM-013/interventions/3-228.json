{"speaker": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). -", "english": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure her that we will be supporting her report.\nThe European Union is right to have at its disposal a tough set of political and economic instruments which can be used against regimes around the world which violate the human rights of their people. But the European Union must be very careful when it comes to imposing political and economic sanctions.\nThe EU is the largest contributor to overseas development aid, but it must act with wisdom and prudence when it comes to sanctions. The effect of sanctions in Zimbabwe, Sudan and Burma, to name but three countries, has been very detrimental to ordinary people in those countries. So we must try and make sure that it does not affect the poorest and most oppressed in these countries but attacks and gets after the people who are leading these countries.\nSome people have mentioned Cuba. I cannot understand why we have sanctions against Cuba. Cuba should be returned to normal trading: in 10 years’ time Cuba would be a radically different country if we did that instead having of these ridiculous sanctions on the place.\nWe must be careful, as I said, when imposing sanctions, and when imposing economic and political sanctions they must be targeted at those who are in charge. Let us target their financial affairs abroad or their travel situation. Sanctions can be useful but they are limited, especially if they are only being used by European Union countries. UN sanctions are far stronger and can be far more effective.\nI support this report but I do think that sanctions are limited. They can be effective, but we must also use prudence and wisdom when we implement them.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure her that we will be supporting her report.\nThe European Union is right to have at its disposal a tough set of political and economic instruments which can be used against regimes around the world which violate the human rights of their people.
