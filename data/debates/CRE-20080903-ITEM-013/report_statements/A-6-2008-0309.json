    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Deplores the fact that, to date, no evaluation or impact assessment has been carried out in respect of the EU’s sanctions policy and that it is therefore extremely difficult to gauge the policy’s impact and effectiveness on the ground and thus to draw the necessary conclusions; calls on the Council and the Commission to carry out this evaluation work; in this connection, points out that a basic criterion for this evaluation must be the achievement of lasting results;considers, nevertheless, that the sanctions policy used against South Africa proved effective in helping to end apartheid;\n",
        "2.   Considers that disparities in the legal bases for the implementation of the EU’s sanctions policy, involving different decision-making, implementation and supervision levels, are undermining the transparency and coherence of European sanctions policy and, as a result, the credibility thereof;\n",
        "3.   Considers that, for sanctions to be effective, their introduction must be seen as legitimate by public opinion at European and international levels and in countries in which changes are expected; stresses that consultation of the European Parliament in the decision-making process gives them added legitimacy;\n",
        "4.   Notes also that sanctions can have symbolic value as an expression of the EU’s moral condemnation, thus giving added visibility and credibility to EU foreign policy; warns, however, against placing too much emphasis on the idea of sanctions as symbolic measures, as this could result in them becoming totally devalued;\n",
        "5.   Considers that recourse to sanctions should be envisaged in the case of actions by authorities which seriously undermine security and human rights or where all contractual and/or diplomatic options have been explored or have clearly reached stalemate, owing to the actions of the third party;\n",
        "6.   Takes the view that any voluntary and irreversible degradation of the environment constitutes a threat to security and a serious violation of human rights; in this connection, calls on the Council and the Commission to include any voluntary and irreversible damage caused to the environment among the grounds which may lead to the adoption of sanctions;\n",
        "7.   Acknowledges that the overall EU sanctions instruments are generally deployed flexibly in accordance with needs on a case-by-case basis; deplores, however, the fact that the EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently, by treating third countries differently even though their human rights and democratic records are similar, and thus triggering criticism for applying ‘double standards’;\n",
        "8.   Believes in this respect that the application and evaluation of sanctions by the European Union for infringements of human rights must in principle prevail over any harm deriving from their application to the trading interests of the European Union and its citizens;\n",
        "9.   Regrets that the existence of intra-EU disagreements on policies towards a given country such as Cuba or the reluctance of Member States to antagonise major partners such as Russia have led the EU to adopt only ‘informal sanctions’ in Presidency Conclusions, reflecting an unbalanced or inconsistent application of EU sanctions; recognises, however, that measures included in the Council conclusions, such as the deferral of the signing of agreements with countries such as Serbia, could be a useful tool in order to pressure third countries to fully cooperate with international mechanisms;\n",
        "10. Recalls that, with regard to Cuba, the Common Position adopted in 1996 and periodically renewed implies a roadmap for peaceful transition to democracy on the island, is being fully implemented and is not the subject of controversy in the European institutions; notes that the differences within the European Union arise from the measures adopted in June 2003 to complement the Common Position; stresses that certain measures such as the suspension of high-level visits to Cuba, the reduction of cultural cooperation and the incitement of dissidents by the EU Member States to engage in organised initiatives have to a degree penalised the Cuban population; expresses concern that, following their adoption, the Cuban authorities unilaterally decided to end cooperation with the EU; urges that any decision regarding the authorities of that country should be accompanied by firm, concrete and tangible requirements regarding human rights and that such requirements be binding also on the European Union institutions in their relations with the Cuban regime; accordingly calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience together with the immediate recognition of the freedom of all Cubans, including the Sakharov Prize winners Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas and the Ladies in White, to enter and leave their own country;\n",
        "11. Considers that the argument of the ‘ineffectiveness’ of sanctions cannot be used in favour of lifting them and that it should be used instead to re-orientate and reassess the sanction itself; takes the view, moreover, that the continuation or not of sanctions should depend solely on whether their objectives have been achieved, and that their type may be strengthened or altered on the basis of their evaluation; considers that, to this end, sanctions should always be accompanied by clear benchmarks;\n",
        "12. Considers that the effectiveness of sanctions should be analysed at a number of levels, both in terms of the measures’ intrinsic effectiveness, i.e. their ability to have an impact on the private and professional activities of the individuals targeted as members of a target regime, or on the operation thereof, and in terms of their political effectiveness, i.e. their ability to bring about a stop to, or to alter, the activities or policies which have let to their adoption;\n",
        "13. Believes that the effectiveness of a sanction depends on the European Union’s capacity to maintain it for the full period and, in this connection, deplores the use of provisions such as ‘sunset clauses’ involving the automatic lifting of sanctions;\n",
        "14. Opposes the application, in all circumstances, of generalised, indiscriminate sanctions to any country, since this approach leads de facto to the total isolation of the population; considers that, unless coordinated with other political instruments, economic sanctions can succeed only with great difficulty in facilitating political reform within the regime targeted; stresses, therefore, that any sanctions taken against government authorities should systematically be coupled with support for civil society in the country concerned;\n",
        "15. Points out that most EU sanctions are being imposed on the basis of security concerns; underlines however that human rights violations should constitute a sufficient basis for the application of sanctions since they likewise represent a threat to security and stability;\n",
        "16. Points out that the main purpose of sanctions is to bring about a change of policy or activities in line with the objectives of the CFSP Common Position or conclusions adopted by the Council, or the international decision on which the sanctions are based;\n",
        "17. Insists on the fact that the Council, by adopting the above-mentioned Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures (Sanctions), has committed itself to using sanctions as part of a comprehensive and integrated policy approach; stresses in this respect that this approach includes in parallel political dialogue, incentives and conditionality, and could even involve, as a last resort, the use of coercive measures, as set out in the Basic Principles; considers that human rights and democracy clauses, the system of generalised preferences and development aid should be used as tools of such a comprehensive and integrated policy approach;\n",
        "18. Stresses that the implementation of the human rights clause cannot be regarded as an entirely autonomous or unilateral EU sanction, as it stems directly from the bilateral or multilateral agreement, which establishes a reciprocal undertaking to respect human rights; considers that appropriate measures taken in accordance with this clause exclusively concern the implementation of the relevant agreement in giving either party the lawful basis for suspending or annulling the agreement; considers, therefore, that the implementation of human rights clauses and autonomous or unilateral sanctions necessarily complement each other;\n",
        "19. Welcomes, therefore, the systematic inclusion of human rights clauses and insists on the incorporation of a specific implementation mechanism in all new bilateral agreements, including sector-specific agreements, signed with third countries; recalls, in this connection, the importance of the recommendations issued with a view to more effective and systematic implementation of the clause, namely the formulation of objectives and reference criteria and regular evaluation, reiterates its call for the human rights clauses to be implemented through a more transparent procedure of consultation between the parties, including the European Parliament and civil society, detailing the political and legal mechanisms to be used in the event of a request for bilateral cooperation being suspended on the grounds of repeated and/or systematic human rights violations in breach of international law; supports the procedural model established under the Cotonou Agreement for reacting to grave violations of human rights, for democratic principles and for the rule of law; believes that the system of intensive political dialogue (Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement) and consultations (Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement), before and after the adoption of appropriate measures, has in several cases provided a successful instrument for improving the situation on the ground;\n",
        "20. Urges the Commission and the Member States not to propose free trade agreements and/or association agreements – even containing human rights clauses – to governments of countries where, according to reports by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations, massive human rights violations are being perpetrated;\n",
        "21. Considers that failure to take appropriate or restrictive measures in the event of a situation marked by persistent human rights violations seriously undermines the Union’s human rights strategy, sanctions policy and credibility;\n",
        "22. Considers that a sanctions policy will be much more effective when it forms part of a coherent human rights strategy; reiterates its request to the Council and the Commission to devise a specific strategy on human rights and the situation as regards democracy as part of each country strategy paper and other similar types of documents;\n",
        "23. Considers that, in the case of the imposition of sanctions, the human rights dialogues and consultations should necessarily and systematically incorporate discussions on progress made in the fulfilment of the objectives and benchmarks set out at the time of the adoption of the restrictive measures; considers, at the same time, that the objectives achieved in human rights dialogues and consultations should under no circumstances replace the achievement of the objectives underpinning sanctions;\n",
        "24. Takes the view that coordinated action by the international community has a stronger impact than disparate and uneven actions by States or regional entities; welcomes, therefore, the fact that the EU sanctions policy should continue to be based on the notion of a preference in favour of the UN regime;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Council, in the absence of UN Security Council sanctions, to cooperate with non-EU sanctioning states, to share information, to work towards a common list of individuals subject to asset freezes, travel bans or other measures, and to coordinate action at international level to prevent sanctions evasions and to maximise the effectiveness and implementation of EU sanctions and other sanctions, in conformity with international law;\n",
        "26. Considers that the EU should seek cooperation with other regional organisations, such as the African Union and ASEAN, in order to promote human rights and ensure coordination of actions on sanctions;\n",
        "27. Calls on the EU to systematically develop a dialogue with non-sanctioning states with a view to reaching a common position on restrictive measures, especially at regional level; points out that, as shown in the case of Burma/Myanmar, sanctions do not often bring about the required change of policy or activities when the international community is divided and major players are not involved in their implementation;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Council and the Commission systematically to include on the agenda for political dialogues with non-sanctioning states the issue of their role and influence vis-à-vis the target regime or non-state actors, whether individuals, organisations or companies;\n",
        "29. Considers that the prospect of the signing of a free trade agreement with the regions in which a target country is situated should be used as a ‘carrot’ and means of pressure and that such an agreement should, in any case, not include the country to which sanctions are being applied;\n",
        "30. Underlines the need for an in-depth analysis of each specific situation prior to the adoption of sanctions in order to assess the potential impact of different sanctions, and to determine which are the most effective in the light of all other relevant factors and comparable experiences; considers that such prior analysis is all the more justified since it is difficult to backtrack once the sanctions process has been initiated without undermining the EU’s credibility and the expression of the EU’s support for the population of the target third country, given the fact that the country’s authorities can instrumentalise the EU decision; takes note in this respect of the current practice whereby the appropriateness, nature and effectiveness of the proposed sanctions are discussed in the Council on the basis of assessment by the Heads of Mission in the country concerned, and calls for the inclusion of an independent expert’s report in such assessment;\n",
        "31. Stresses, however, that such analysis should not be used to delay the adoption of sanctions; emphasises in this respect that the two-step procedure for the imposition of sanctions under the CFSP provides scope for an urgent political reaction, initially through the adoption of a common position to be set out after a more in-depth analysis of the Regulation, detailing the exact nature and scope of the sanctions;\n",
        "32. Calls for the systematic inclusion in the legal instruments of clear and specific benchmarks as conditions for the lifting of the sanctions; insists, in particular, that the reference criteria should be established on the basis of an independent evaluation and that those criteria should not be altered at a later stage, depending on political changes within the Council;\n",
        "33. Calls on the Council and the Commission to set up an exemplary sanctions review process, notably involving the systematic inclusion of a review clause which entails revisiting the sanctions regime on the basis of the established benchmarks and assessing whether the objectives have been met; insists that declarations of intent or the will to establish procedures that will produce positive results are to be welcomed, but stresses that they should under no circumstances, when sanctions are evaluated, replace the achievement of tangible and genuine progress in meeting reference criteria;\n",
        "34. Believes that the arms embargo imposed on China is an illustration of EU coherence and consistency, given that this embargo was originally established following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and the EU has not received to date any explanations about that massacre, and that there is therefore no reason to lift this embargo;\n",
        "35. Calls on the ‘Sanctions’ formation of the Foreign Relations Counsellors Working Party (RELEX/Sanctions) to fulfil their mandate to the full; insists in particular on the need to conduct research prior to the adoption of sanctions and, after their adoption, to provide on a regular basis updated information on developments and to develop best practices with regard to the implementation and enforcement of restrictive measures;\n",
        "36. Recognises that states as well as international and regional organisations should be accountable for internationally wrongful acts in the implementation of sanctions and stresses in this regard the need for a judicial mechanism with a view to guaranteeing conformity with international law and humanitarian law;\n",
        "37. Requests that Parliament be associated in all the stages of a sanctions process: the decision-making process leading to sanctions, the selection of the sanctions most appropriate to the situation, and also the definition of benchmarks and the evaluation of their implementation within the framework of the review mechanism and the lifting of the sanction;\n",
        "38. Deplores the fact that, owing to a lack of evaluation, it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of targeted measures; recognises, however, the EU’s strong humanitarian concern, which has led to the abandonment of sanctions of general economic scope, as previously done in the case of Iraq, and to the imposition of more targeted, ‘smart’ sanctions, geared to achieving the maximum impact on those whose behaviour it wants to influence while minimising adverse humanitarian effects or consequences for persons not targeted or neighbouring countries;\n",
        "39. Considers that economic sanctions used in isolation from other policy instruments are extremely unlikely to force a targeted regime to make major policy changes; stresses, moreover, that far-reaching economic restrictions may entail excessively high economic and humanitarian costs, and therefore reiterates its call for more carefully designed and better targeted economic sanctions, designed to have an impact primarily on key leaders of targeted regimes and perpetrators of human rights violations;\n",
        "40.Emphasises that any economic sanctions should first and foremost target those sectors which are not employment-intensive and are of limited relevance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are important both for economic development and for redistribution of income;\n",
        "41. Supports the use of targeted financial sanctions against key leaders of targeted regimes and their immediate family members, which act directly on the income of the sanctioned individuals; stresses the need for these sanctions to be accompanied by appropriate measures against EU economic operators cooperating with such persons; stresses that targeted commodity sanctions targeting a specific or major source of income of a regime present the risk of more wide-ranging, indiscriminate effects on the population and may favour the development of a ‘black economy’;\n",
        "42. Considers that economic and financial sanctions, even when they are targeted, must be applied by all natural and legal persons pursuing commercial activities in the EU, including citizens of third countries, and European citizens or legal persons registered or established in accordance with the legislation of an EU Member State who pursue commercial activities outside the EU;\n",
        "43. Calls for a limited application of the ‘extraordinary exemptions’ to the freezing of assets; calls, however, for the introduction of ‘humanitarian exemptions’, such as a system to permit access to basic medical care; calls for the creation of a specific procedure for objections in the event that a Member State wishes to grant an exemption to the freezing of assets, since the efficiency of the restrictive measure is undermined by the lack of such a procedure given that the Member States are only required to inform the Commission in advance of such an exemption;\n",
        "44. Calls for action to improve the application of the EU’s targeted financial sanctions, in order to ensure that, in practice, the measures comprehensively deny designated persons and entities access to all financial services within the EU’s jurisdiction, including those that pass through EU clearing-house banks or otherwise make use of financial services within the EU’s jurisdiction; stresses the need for greater flexibility in the distribution of sanction lists within the EU and within Member States to all persons covered by the obligations laid down in the Third Money Laundering Directive[25]; proposes that each Member State designate one institution responsible for disseminating this information;\n",
        "45. Calls for enhanced cooperation by the Council and the Commission with the SWIFT management and shareholders in Europe, so as to achieve improved results in the freezing of blacklisted accounts and the elimination of money transfers from/to such accounts;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Council and the Commission to investigate the possibilities and ways of using frozen income of targeted authorities in a constructive manner, for example by allocating them for development purposes;\n",
        "47. Notes that arms embargoes are a form of sanction designed to stop the flow of arms and military equipment to conflict areas or to regimes that are likely to use them for internal repression or aggression against a foreign country as set out in the Code of Conduct on arms exports;\n",
        "48. Calls for coordinated cooperation between Member States and the Commission regarding the implementation of EU arms embargoes which are applied by each Member State;\n",
        "49. Calls on the Member States to adopt the common position on arms exports that will make the current Code of Conduct on arms exports legally binding;\n",
        "50. Urges the Council, the Commission and Member States to continue to work for improvements in UN monitoring and enforcement capabilities, and supports the view that a permanent UN team should be established to assess trade in conflict commodities and the value of sanctions in relation to them;\n",
        "51. Recalls that restrictions on admission (travel bans, visa bans) constitute one of the initial steps in the EU’s sanctions sequence, entailing the prohibition of blacklisted persons or non-state entities from attending EU official meetings and also from travelling to the EU for private reasons;\n",
        "52. Notes with concern that Member States’ adherence to EU visa bans has not been optimal; calls on the Member States to adopt a concerted approach in applying travel restrictions and the relevant exemption clauses;\n",
        "53. Takes account of the fact that both the autonomous EU anti-terrorist sanctions and the EU implementation of Security Council anti-terrorist sanctions are the subject of several cases before the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice;\n",
        "54. Recalls the obligation of EU Member States to draft sanctions in compliance with Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which requires the Union to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States; stresses that the present blacklisting procedures at both the EU and the UN levels are deficient from the perspective of legal security and legal remedies;\n",
        "55. Calls on the Council and the Commission to support the existing procedure for blacklisting and delisting, in order to respect the procedural and substantive human rights of EU citizens, especially the right to life, liberty and security of the person; calls, similarly, on the EU Member States to promote such a review within the UN mechanisms in order to ensure respect for fundamental rights when applying targeted sanctions in the fight against terrorism;\n",
        "56. Considers that Article 75 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, would be an opportunity to be seized by the European Parliament in order to remedy the shortcomings in current practice, and supports all the current parliamentary work aimed at being included on the agenda for the 2009 legislative programme;\n",
        "57. Regrets that none of the judicial bodies is in position to assess the appropriateness of blacklisting, given that the evidence leading to blacklisting is based primarily on information held by the secret services, whichipso factooperate in secret; considers, however, that this fundamental discretion should not be transformed into impunity in the case of breaches of international law; calls in this regard on EU Member States to guarantee effective parliamentary control over the work of the secret services; considers in this regard that it is necessary to associate the European Parliament with the work done by the Conference of Oversight Committees of the Intelligence Bodies of the Member States already in place;\n",
        "58. Reiterates, however, that the system of anti-terrorist lists, provided that it respects the most recent case-law of the Court of Justice, is an effective instrument and one of the pillars of European Union anti-terrorist policy;\n",
        "59. Stresses that terrorism is a threat to safety and freedom, and therefore urges the Council to review and update the list of terrorist organisations, taking into account their activities on all continents;\n",
        "60. Notes that the EU has always promoted a positive approach to the use of sanctions with a view to encouraging change; stresses, to this end, that it is important to give priority to an integrated global action through a progressive strategy of pressures and incentives;\n",
        "61. Considers that a strategy of openness and a policy of sanctions are not mutually exclusive; takes the view, therefore, that the EU’s sanctions policy may help to improve respect for human rights in the sanctioned country when revised for the express purpose of introducing a policy of positive measures; in this respect, notes the cycle of sanctions imposed in respect of Uzbekistan from November 2007 to April 2008: while continuing for one year the sanctions imposed for failure to satisfy initial criteria pertaining to investigations into the Andijan massacre and respect for human rights, the Council decided to suspend the implementation of the visa ban, leaving the Uzbek regime six months in which to fulfil a set of human rights criteria, and with the looming threat of the automatic re-establishment of the visa ban; notes that the mix of engagement and sanctions produced some positive developments, thanks to the possible automatic re-establishment of the sanctions and the definition of precise conditions; emphasises that these conditions must be capable of being satisfied within a limited time frame and relevant to the general sanctions regime; regrets, however, that there have not yet been any substantial positive developments and that the lack of cooperation with the Uzbek Government continues;\n",
        "62. Urges that sanctions be systematically accompanied, in the context of a multifold strategy, by enhanced positive measures to support civil society, human rights defenders and all kinds of projects promoting human rights and democracy; calls for the thematic programmes and instruments (EIDHR, non-state actors, investing in people) to contribute fully to achieving this objective;\n",
        "63. Calls on the Council and the Commission to seize the opportunity provided by the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and the subsequent creation of the European External Action Service to guarantee optimum consistency in the EU’s various external action instruments as a key element of the further efficiency of sanctions policy;\n",
        "64. Calls on the Commission and the Council to undertake a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the EU’s sanctions policy so as to determine what influence it has and what measures should be taken to strengthen it; urges the Commission and the Council to submit a programme of such measures; calls on the Commission and the Council to assess the impact of sanctions on the development policy of the countries in question and on the EU’s trade policy;\n",
        "65. Calls on the Commission to ensure that development assistance strategies under the Development Cooperation Instrument and the European Development Fund are consistent with existing sanction regimes and human rights dialogues; calls on the Commission to ensure that the conditions for general budget support, including under the so-called ‘Millennium Development Goals contracts’, are explicitly linked to human rights and democracy criteria;\n",
        "66. Calls on the Council and the Commission to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the appointment of a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy – who will at the same time be Vice-President of the Commission and chair of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs –and the subsequent creation of the European External Action Service in order to make the EU’s external action more coherent and consistent, to improve the expertise of the relevant EU services working in the field of sanctions and to enhance cooperation between the different services;\n",
        "67. Calls at the same time for enhanced cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission in order to ensure more coherent and effective implementation of restrictive measures;\n",
        "68. Calls also on those Member States that are members of the UN Security Council systematically to seek to internationalise sanctions issued by the European Union, pursuant to Article 19 of the TEU;\n",
        "69. Calls on the Member States, in their actions within the UN Security Council, not to infringe the human rights obligations which they have contracted, in particular under the European Convention on Human Rights;\n",
        "70. Commits its parliamentary bodies, specifically its standing and ad hoc delegations, to using their contacts with parliaments in non-sanctioning countries so as to enhance understanding of existing EU sanctions regimes relevant to the region concerned and to examine possibilities for coordinated action for the promotion of human rights;\n",
        "71. Considers that the legitimacy of the sanctions policy, which constitutes a key and sensitive element of the CFSP, must be enhanced by involving the European Parliament at all stages of the procedure, in accordance with Article 21 of the TEU, in particular in the drafting and implementation of sanctions in the form of systematic consultation with, and reports from, the Commission and the Council; considers also that Parliament should be involved in overseeing the attainment of benchmarks by those who are subject to sanctions; instructs its Subcommittee on Human Rights to structure and supervise work in this area as regards any sanction the objectives and reference criteria of which relate to human rights;\n",
        "72. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
