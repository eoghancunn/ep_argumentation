{"speaker": "Richard Howitt (PSE). –", "english": "Richard Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, I welcome this debate and report on social reality and, though we must of course welcome stocktaking and exchanges of best practice and the open method of coordination, the reality that we have to understand is that these devices have not yet stopped: women having 24 % less pay compared to men in Germany; nearly one in three children living in poverty in Poland; and wealth inequality in my own country, the United Kingdom, at a 40-year high.\nI do think that European social funding and national programmes like the New Deal in the UK are essential active labour market measures to tackle the real barriers which prevent groups in our society from progressing from worklessness to work and that work is still one of the best devices for us to combat poverty.\nI do thank Commissioner Špidla for putting a firm commitment in the Commission’s work programme for new legislation on Article 13 discrimination, which I have long discussed with him. I and this Parliament look forward to working with him on the detail, not least in the Presidency conference next week.\nBut all of us – he and us together – must guard against this talk on stocktaking delaying the new social agenda in Europe, or deregulation in one area actually leading to increases in inequality and injustice, not combating these evils.\nTrade unionists, social NGOs and of course disabled people, with whom I have worked for more than 20 years, are sceptical about what we are doing for social Europe. We have to listen to their concerns and we have to respond to them.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, I welcome this debate and report on social reality and, though we must of course welcome stocktaking and exchanges of best practice and the open method of coordination, the reality that we have to understand is that these devices have not yet stopped: women having 24 % less pay compared to men in Germany; nearly one in three children living in poverty in Poland; and wealth inequality in my own country, the United Kingdom, at a 40-year high.\nI do think that European social funding and national programmes like the New Deal in the UK are essential active labour market measures to tackle the real barriers which prevent groups in our society from progressing from worklessness to work and that work is still one of the best devices for us to combat poverty.\nI do thank Commissioner Špidla for putting a firm commitment in the Commission’s work programme for new legislation on Article 13 discrimination, which I have long discussed with him.
