    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the Commission communication on a European agenda for culture and endorses the aims set out therein; notes that it has pointed on several occasions to the essential role of culture in imparting structure to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy and establishing a new pillar of global governance and sustainable development;\n",
        "2.  Likewise welcomes the fact that the above-mentioned Commission communication has been well received by the Council, as reflected in the Council resolution of 15 November 2007;\n",
        "3.   Underlines that local, regional and national authorities play a key role in developing and fostering culture, especially in protecting cultural heritage, as well as promoting artistic innovation and creative industries;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the fact that the Commission is addressing the mobility of artists and culture sector professionals;\n",
        "5.  Points to the need to promote the emergence and mobility of young European artists;\n",
        "6.  Regrets that no reference to the role of the large number of partnerships between cities, local authorities and regions has been made in establishing a European agenda for culture in a globalising world;\n",
        "7.  Highlights the fact that the cultural sector plays an important part in attaining the objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy and draws attention to the importance of culture in creating a good and dynamic living environment, notably through the tremendous opportunities afforded by cultural tourism for the economic development of many regions;\n",
        "8.  Points out that in the light of Article 151 of the Treaty, action in the culture sector, which must not undermine cultural diversity and national identities, has to take the form of cooperation policies and partnership agreements between Member States; also points to the role of the regions of the European Union as an important forum for cultural cooperation;\n",
        "9.  Is concerned that the communication fails to clarify the ongoing problem concerning misunderstandings about culture in terms of contemporary and traditional arts, the European heritage and the profit-driven and profitable \"creative industries\". Moreover, the objectives set out in the agenda generally represent culture as having important social, economic, political and more generally \"instrumental\" value but do not incorporate the issue of culture as a value in itself (culture qua culture);\n",
        "10. Is concerned that in the debate on intercultural and cultural dialogue and on what is meant by \"culture\", it is often understood that culture unites people together rather than being a moderator of differences. In this context, Jean Monnet could be quoted: those young people \"acquainted with all that is great and good in different cultures, without ceasing to look to their own lands with love and pride, they will become Europeans\";\n",
        "11. Believes that if Article 151(4) of the Treaty is to be implemented completely and coherently, the specific features of the culture sector, not least its creative and innovative potential and its social significance have to be taken into account as cultural and economic goods so that culture can fully assume its rightful place within the Lisbon strategy;\n",
        "12. Believes that the Commission’s objective to further develop dialogue with civil society in the cultural sector is crucial to the development of a coherent European agenda for culture, and that only through such structured dialogue could European policies genuinely reflect the realities and demands of European artists and cultural operators;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission to submit recommendations for the protection of digital rights management systems which take equal account of the requirements of the EU internal market and of the Unesco Convention on the Protection of Cultural Diversity;\n",
        "14. Stresses that cultural productivity and artists’ creativity must be guaranteed in a sustainable manner, but that this presupposes a secure social situation for artists, including an appropriate legal framework in the areas of tax, labour, social security and copyright law;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to breathe life into the Unesco Convention on the Protection of Cultural Diversity and to take full account of the Convention’s underlying principles in its internal and external policies;\n",
        "16. Reminds the Commission that the Community is duty-bound to implement the Unesco Convention on the Protection of Cultural Diversity when exercising the competences it enjoys in policy areas which are covered by the Convention, namely ‘the common commercial policy, development cooperation policy, economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries, free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, competition, and the internal market, including intellectual property’ (Answer to Written Question P-5554/07);\n",
        "17. Believes that the existing Community programmes in the culture sector do not fully reflect the implications of Europeans’ common cultural heritage, and calls on the Commission, therefore, to propose that specific programmes be drawn up in order to foster artistic creativity and preserve the links, on a wider scale and at a deeper seated level, with the goods and values, both tangible and intangible, that constitute European cultural heritage and to enable those goods and values to interact according to the humanist conception of identities and differences and in present-day cultural works, thus making it possible to reap and share their benefits;\n",
        "18. Points out that the EU has an essential role to play in taking practical measures genuinely conducive to the mobility of European and non-Community artists;\n",
        "19. Stresses that the programmes in the culture sector will all do a great deal to foster cohesion, real convergence, economic growth, sustainable development, innovation, employment and competitiveness;\n",
        "20. Calls for a specific visa to be introduced for artists to enable them to accept immediately when they are offered a very short professional engagement;\n",
        "21. Reiterates the strategic importance of the attractive EU cultural project – the European Capital of Culture scheme - which gives a significant boost to the social and economic development of cities and regions by injecting European added value;\n",
        "22. Asks the Commission to pay particular attention to the strong and effective cooperation between the 2007 to 2011 European Capitals of Culture and the 2010 Cultural Cities Network, which brings together more than 20 towns and cities from Hungary, Germany and Turkey to work together on the development of their own European cultural objectives, to join the Capitals of Culture in their preparations for 2010 and to present their projects simultaneously at a wide range of different locations;\n",
        "23. Maintains that mobility and flexibility are the only means of both ensuring the survival of creative activity in the individual Member States and of fostering a European cultural identity;\n",
        "24. Recommends to the Council and to the Commission that a programme be drawn up with a view to enhancing the prestige of Europe's classical heritage and the historic contributions of national cultures in all their dimensions down through the centuries, and that such a programme should exist alongside and complement the ‘Culture’ framework programme for 2007 to 2013 while also allowing for the needs of the culture sector in the future;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission to intensify the policies in support of literary translation provided for in the ‘Culture Programme (2007 to 2013)’;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to draw up a programme aimed at developing the promotion of European languages in the world and their role in creative artistic activity in other continents, so as to facilitate both mutual knowledge and understanding and the cultural interaction generated and conveyed by those languages in their extra-European dimensions;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to enhance and promote international cultural exchanges and the acquisition of cultural skills and multilingualism among the citizens of the European Union;\n",
        "28. Stresses that, in view of the designation of 2008 as the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the European Union should put the values of intercultural dialogue into practice and open itself up to other cultures and promote and develop opportunities for cooperation by proposing an interesting range of cultural programmes to European third countries, in particular those covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, for whom involvement in joint cultural programmes would have an extremely important mobilising influence;\n",
        "29. Proposes that Parliament, the Council, the Commission, and the Member States undertake to establish conditions genuinely conducive to culture and creative activity in every walk of life in the Union, focusing in particular on the family, schools, lifelong learning, the mass media, and the world of digital technologies;\n",
        "30. Maintains that specific cultural projects must continue to be promoted at European level, the European digital library being one example; calls for the library to be set up more rapidly;\n",
        "31. Supports the numerous cultural partnership arrangements between towns, communities and regions, which are of great importance for the social development of the regions and the promotion of cultural innovation; calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide every support for local, regional and interregional cultural initiatives as an essential factor in the process of regional and European integration in the face of global challenges;\n",
        "32. Points out that teaching of the arts and literature has an important part to play in rounding out the personalities of young people, awakening and fostering their vocations, and enabling them to enjoy cultural goods and values to the full;\n",
        "33. Stresses the need for the school syllabuses in all Member States to include a common history of the European Union teaching programme to promote European identity and culture in the context of globalisation;\n",
        "34. Maintains that it is important, both in schools and in society, to build innovative bridges between culture and research, science, and technology, and to have programmes covering these matters;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission to devise means in order to identify sectors in crisis in European cultural industries, focusing particular attention on the publishing market, in which the trend has been such that high-quality creative writing is now in danger of being eclipsed by best-sellers, and on the world of music-making, the quality and diversity of which are likewise being threatened by the worldwide spread of digital technologies by the concentration processes entailed in collective rights management and by piracy;\n",
        "36. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to employ the means needed to enforce and protect literary and artistic property rights, especially in the digital environment;\n",
        "37. Believes that the foundations should be laid for genuine European cultural diplomacy and calls on the Member States and the Community institutions to strengthen the cultural element of their diplomatic representation and embark on regular organised initiatives devoted to European culture;\n",
        "38. Calls on the Member States and the Community institutions to encourage initiatives aimed at developing cultural tourism;\n",
        "39. Recommends that the Council and the Commission compile and promote a list of ‘cultural places of pilgrimage’ in all the Member States with a view to organising specific initiatives and events to take place regularly in these monuments to, and powerhouses of, culture;\n",
        "40. Believes that a European heritage label should be established with a view to emphasising the European dimension of cultural goods, monuments, memorial sites, and places of remembrance, which all bear witness to Europe’s history and heritage;\n",
        "41. Recommends that the Council and the Commission support and promote the Council of Europe’s European Cultural Routes programme, launched in 1987, since the routes in question constitute exemplary networks encompassing regions and local communities and bear witness to Europe’s heritage and shared history;\n",
        "42. Proposes that the Council and the Commission establish a European arts sponsorship scheme and the designation of ‘European patron of the arts’ so as to enable the public and private sectors to enter into effective partnerships consistent with the aims of the Commission’s proposed action;\n",
        "43. Proposes also that prestigious European prizes, awarded on a regular basis, be established for every sphere of creative artistic activity;\n",
        "44. Suggests also that the profile of the existing prizes be raised and their effects assessed;\n",
        "45. Suggests that, in view of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Fryderyk Chopin, a brilliant composer who has made an undeniable contribution to world culture, 2010 should be designated the ‘European Year of Fryderyk Chopin’;\n",
        "46. Suggests that the year 2011 be designated ‘European Year of the Greek and Latin Classics’ in order to make the peoples of the Union more aware of this essential aspect of cultural heritage now in danger of being forgotten;\n",
        "47. Recommends that the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, in the interest of promoting European cultural values and demonstrating its commitment to culture, should start regularly organising and supporting a European Year commemorating a significant European personality, artistic activity or cultural event;\n",
        "48. Suggests that improvements be made as regards promotion of, access to, and publicity concerning these measures;\n",
        "49. Points out to the Council that the intended budgetary funding for the measures proposed in the Commission communication and those already in existence need to be reviewed immediately and as a matter of urgency;\n",
        "50. Urges the Commission and the Council to guarantee that the rules governing commercial relations at both the bilateral and the multilateral level are transparent, fair, open, and market-access oriented; further insists that these rules must allow European cultural industries to develop all their potential, particularly in the audiovisual, musical and publishing sectors;\n",
        "51. Calls on the Commission to revise the mechanisms for customs control and exchange of information with the Member States to ensure that they are as effective as possible in combating illegal exports and imports of works of art and other protected cultural goods;\n",
        "52. Calls on the Commission to take the appropriate measures to initiate a thorough revision of the protection of intellectual property rights, in order to better balance the conflicting goals of right-holder protection and free and fair access to cultural products and services in the EU’s acquis communautaire, World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and EU bilateral agreements in order to eradicate the root causes of counterfeiting and piracy;\n",
        "53. Calls on the Commission to use its powers to ensure that all trading partners enforce the obligations of the agreements within the framework of WTO and international trade law, including the potential activation of dispute-settlement instruments provided for by international agreements;\n",
        "54. Calls on the Commission to develop a reliable and coherent set of indicators and instruments to measure and evaluate international trade in cultural products;\n",
        "55. Taking into account that cultural tourism is an ever growing segment of the cultural industry worldwide, calls on the Commission to incorporate in EU trade policy agreements clauses on the spread of and trade in products with cultural and historical value;\n",
        "56. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to increasingly take into account the clauses of the EUs FTAs and other trade instruments that deal with trade in cultural products when following up these trade agreements;\n",
        "57. Stresses the importance of supporting the transborder flow of cultural products through enhanced mobility of artists and workers in the cultural sector; considers that transborder mobility of European arts and culture has a significant role to play in disseminating European values as well as maintaining and developing cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue;\n",
        "58. Calls on the Commission to identify possible non-tariff barriers imposed by third countries in commercial transactions for certain European cultural goods and services and, if necessary, to take steps to eliminate them;\n",
        "59. Stresses, in this regard, that the EU should support and facilitate access to its market in cultural products and services as regards developing countries, paying particular attention to the positive impact that this may have on job creation and technological development in their cultural industries.\n",
        "60. Calls on the Commission to propose specific cultural actions and events that would promote European culture in developing countries, while giving access to culture priority in development policies;\n",
        "61. Supports the systematic integration of the cultural dimension and the various components of culture in all external and development policies, projects and programmes, as a means of strengthening the quality of the Commission’s diplomatic efforts and the viability and sustainability of all EU cooperation activities and of stepping up measures to raise public awareness of the importance of the cultural aspect of development activities;\n",

        "63. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to create an EU-ACP Cultural Fund as a joint EU contribution to supporting the distribution and production of ACP cultural goods, noting that the 10thEuropean Development Fund will provide start-up funds that will be complemented by contributions from the Member States;\n",

        "68. Reminds the Commission that the development of cultural heritage is inextricably linked to public use and enjoyment of it and that cultural heritage should be managed in a sustainable manner in view of its transitory nature; considers, too, that the management of cultural heritage should necessarily be economically viable and consequently play a part in improving the socio-economic conditions in which people live;\n",
        "69. Supports the active involvement of the EU in the work of international organisations dealing with culture and in the United Nations \"Alliance of Civilisations\" process.\n",

        "71. Notes the important role played by local and regional authorities in comprehensively fostering and nurturing culture in their areas; recommends that the Member States involve local and regional authorities in the process not only of monitoring results, but also of implementing any new EU cultural agenda, so that the cultural policy actually implemented reflects the specific expectations and needs of the regions;\n",

        "73. Stresses that cultural tourism plays a significant role in regional economic growth and wealth creation and in enhancing the value of Europe's cultural heritage and that regional cultural associations and people active in the arts must be involved in this process;\n",
        "74. Regrets the fact that the Commission pays too little attention to twinning arrangements between towns, municipalities and regions, which have for many years provided an excellent forum for cultural cooperation and information exchange;\n",
        "75. Emphasises the important role played by local and regional authorities in fostering and nurturing culture in their areas, above all in the sphere of cultural heritage and as patrons of artistic innovation, as the bodies responsible for providing and sponsoring cultural amenities and initiatives and education and training and as organisers of festivals and cultural encounters;\n",
        "76. Calls on the Commission to promote best practices in cultural activities at European level, drawing attention to the fact that most best practices in this area are generated at regional level; suggests that thematic conferences be organised and that publicly accessible best-practice databases be set up in all the official languages of the European Union;\n",
        "77. Bearing in mind the forthcoming European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, stresses the role which the regions can play as a genuine cultural meeting point; calls on the Commission to put forward firm proposals for activities for 2008 and to actively involve the regions in the planning and implementation of these activities;\n",

        "82. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to set up an EU-ACP Cultural Fund as an EU contribution to the distribution of ACP and OCT cultural goods; takes the view that similar arrangements should be put in place for neighbourhood policy countries in particular.\n",
