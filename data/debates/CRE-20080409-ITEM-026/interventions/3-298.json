First, the social situation of artists: I agree with the fact that we should work out an appropriate legal framework in the areas of tax, labour and social security for artists and performers. We should also focus more on the preservation of cultural heritage.\nThe Culture Programme is good, but is not enough, and I support the idea that we should have other programmes alongside it, more focused on the preservation and promotion of European cultural heritage.
