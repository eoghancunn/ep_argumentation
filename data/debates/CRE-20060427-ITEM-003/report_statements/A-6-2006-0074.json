    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the Commission proposal concerning the inclusion of a European Indicator of Language Competence among the criteria used by Member States under the 'Education and Training 2010' programme;\n",
        "2.  Takes this opportunity to stress the importance of European indicators in assessing progress towards achieving common objectives under the Lisbon Strategy in the field of education and training and the importance of the 'Education and Training 2010' Programme for the comparison and formulation of national policies and the introduction of a European strategic framework for the transition to a knowledge-driven economy, by encouraging and exchanging good practices;\n",
        "3.  Notes that the indicator in question seeks to establish accurately, reliably and at regular intervals on the basis of objective tests overall foreign language proficiency standards in all the Member States;\n",
        "4.  Considers that the language tests should also take bilingual and multilingual children into consideration;\n",
        "5.  Shares the Commission's view that in the initial phase this indicator should be used to assess education and training systems in terms of first and second language proficiency standards and that knowledge of the five most widely taught languages within the Union (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian) should be tested; calls on the Commission and Council, however, to proceed to the next stage as soon as possible by taking the necessary measures to extend these tests to a wider range of European languages without however undermining standards of teaching and development regarding languages not assessed by the indictor;\n",
        "6.  Believes that the existence of objective criteria to establish levels of language proficiency and the introduction of a common reference framework in no way restrict the freedom of choice or the organisational methods of the various national educational systems and accordingly endorses the Commission recommendation regarding use of the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages for the purposes of the European Indicator;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Member States to participate actively in the implementation and development of the Indicator and give fresh impetus to language teaching, including through successful language immersion programmes;\n",
        "8.  Urges the Member States to promote multilingualism, by enhancing policies seeking to widen the present range of languages taught, giving priority to the common objectives established under the Lisbon Strategy;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Commission actively to encourage information concerning the advantages of language learning from an early age, and considersthat initiatives to inform the public of the advantages of foreign language proficiency, such as European Day of Languages (26 September), a Council of Europe initiative, and the European Language Label, an EU initiative, shouldcontribute moresubstantially to increasing multilingualism;\n",
        "10. Endorses the Commission proposal regarding participation by the Member States in developing the Indicator to the full, to set up a body consisting of Member State representatives to advise the Commission on policy issues,technical matters and all forms of technical support,and monitor progress regarding the practical use of the Indicator in the Member States;\n",
        "11. Points out that the Indicator proposed by the Commission does not involve additional EU budget outlay, the estimated operating expenditure being met by the existing Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes andthe new integrated Lifelong Learning programme;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission and Council accordingly to ensure that the new integratedLifelong Learning programme is endowed with the necessary resources for the promotion of language learning;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Council and Commission to ensure that the next financial perspectives include sufficient funding for measures to make full use of the Indicator;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Council to concur with the approach, parameters and timescales adopted by the Commission regarding the establishment and implementation of the European Indicator of Language Competence so as to complete the preparatory phase as soon as possible and speed up its implementation, given its particular importance as a policy-making instrument;\n",
        "15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
