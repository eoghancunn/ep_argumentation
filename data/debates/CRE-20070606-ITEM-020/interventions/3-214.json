Will this then be rolled out to apply to all professions and trades? Will we all then require a card before taking up employment? Could you then be prevented from taking employment in your chosen field, as is the case with photographers from other countries in Germany, unless you have a permit? And who will organise this, pray? More bureaucrats?\nJust as over-regulation stifles business, so this proposal will suffocate art. Indeed it will ensure continued foreign dominance in the fields of art and entertainment largely from the United States. I predict that this, if passed, will be another example of the laws of unintended consequences.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, as you might expect, there are many areas of concern to me in this report but sadly I have time only to look at one.
