{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I should like to thank you all for a very interesting debate. I believe that this report will help to boost not only dialogue, but also cooperation in Europe in favour of artists’ creativity and culture.\nI liked the approach of Mrs Pack, because she is very enthusiastic and usually those people are far ahead of the developments, but we need such an approach.\nIn 1992, 15 years ago, most people, especially the Member States, did not want to touch culture, because subsidiarity is a sensitive subject. Now people want to do more through culture, because other realities are there: the market, the euro. The problem is rather intangible. I do not say that we need harmonisation, but we need better conditions for cultures to flourish in order to build understanding, intercultural relations and so on.\nTherefore, last Monday’s communication was the first in 50 years where the Commission set a kind of political manifesto and proposed a common cultural agenda. We propose to organise a kind of annual forum, the Davos Forum, which will bring together Member States, stakeholders and the European institutions to discuss, move forward and provide answers to cultural issues.\nConcerning new programmes – Erasmus has been mentioned a few times – this year we will have three times as many opportunities to increase mobility or triple the intensity of Erasmus. However, we need compatibility of studies or recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications. I proposed last autumn – and this is also in Parliament’s and the Council’s ‘European qualifications framework’ – making our qualifications more readable, comparable and transferable. Please make your contributions in autumn or by the end of this year, under the Portuguese Presidency.\nTo conclude, there have been many calls for visas. Visa facilitation is already in place, and I hope the Member States – with the exception of Ireland, the UK and Denmark – will enforce such visa facilitation for students to improve mobility of students and others.\nFor workers, which means professionals, in September we want to bring forward proposals on two important directives. The first is a proposal for a horizontal framework directive on the basic rights of all labour migrants. This proposal will provide for the creation of a combined residence and work permit in order to reduce administrative red tape. The second is even more important in this respect, because of what many of you have said. It is a proposal for a directive on the admission of highly-skilled workers. This directive may, in certain cases, directly apply to third-country artists and grant them facilitated access to EU labour markets. We can go back 15 years or 5 years, but now is the time to move, and together we can do something.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission .
