{"speaker": "Gyula Hegyi,", "english": "Gyula Hegyi, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, this morning on the plane from Budapest to Brussels I met the Director of the Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestra. He congratulated me on the Gibault report and told me how satisfied he and his colleagues were with it. The congratulations should go to Mrs Gibault, who worked hard in a good spirit and with good intentions on this very important subject.\nAll of us respect artists and recognise their important contribution to European culture. We should help them by improving their social status. It is crucial for them to have information on the various social arrangements in the different Member States, for instance, in terms of health insurance systems and unemployment and pension provisions. In fact, some of the new Member States provided rather good social conditions for artists during the so-called ancien régime , but that changed during the transition period. Time spent by artists on rehearsals should be considered effective working time.\nThe free movement of artists, and employees in general, from the new Member States is still not ensured. Visa facilitation for third-country performers is important, but we must give priority to the free movement of all citizens of the European Union.\nI welcome the report. My fellow Socialists and I will vote for it. However, as a Member from a new Member State, I have to call for free access to the labour market for every European citizen.\nIt should also be mentioned that some leading Hungarian artists refuse to travel to the United States owing to the degrading treatment inflicted by the American border authorities.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gyula Hegyi, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, this morning on the plane from Budapest to Brussels I met the Director of the Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestra.
