{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Gibault, an artist herself, for preparing this very important report, and Nathalie Griesbeck for introducing the report tonight.\nWhen celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, I think we realise how much culture is at the heart of the European project. We have programmes and projects at EU level that encourage artists’ mobility in Europe and thus strengthen intercultural dialogue in the European Union. For example, in 2006, which was the European Year of Workers’ Mobility, we co-financed three projects focusing on artists’ mobility out of a total of 41 projects funded over the year. These projects led to better acknowledgement at EU level of the various obstacles to artists’ mobility. It is a first step, and I know that if we are to improve the situation of artists in Europe, many challenges still lie ahead of us concerning lifelong learning, work permits and social status.\nLast month, I proposed a communication on culture with the title ‘A European agenda for culture in a globalising world’, which was adopted by the Commission. I presented this communication to the Committee on Culture and Education and to Ministers at the last Council meeting. The objective is to involve all stakeholders – Member States, European institutions and the cultural world – in a shared agenda of priorities for the years ahead. Improving the status of artists, which is linked to improved mobility and the circulation of works of art in the European Union, is one of the strategy’s key challenges. It is a prerequisite if we want to succeed in having a European cultural space. Therefore I am looking forward to working closely with you on this issue, and especially with the Member States, because responsibility in this regard is primarily at national, regional and local level.\nTurning back to the report, I particularly welcome the emphasis on lifelong learning and retraining. Initial education nurtures the first spark of an artistic vocation, but continuing to retrain is the key to ensuring artists’ social situation in a rapidly evolving economy of the arts. As you know, strengthening the links between education and culture is also one of my objectives because I propose to designate 2009 ‘European Year of Creativity and Innovation’. Work is under way to prepare a Eurydice survey of cultural and artistic education at compulsory school level in Europe. This is one step towards improving our knowledge base and I hope that the Year will stimulate research and the development of a stronger and wider evidence base and evidence-based policy and practice in relation to education in the arts.\nFinally, I would like to stress that the issue of the status of artists in Europe is a very broad topic, which cannot be dealt with in isolation by only one Commissioner responsible for culture. Therefore, within the framework of the communication we proposed last month, I will work closely with my colleagues responsible for employment, justice and the internal market in order to ensure that the specificities of the cultural sector are duly taken into account in other EU programmes and policies.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission .
