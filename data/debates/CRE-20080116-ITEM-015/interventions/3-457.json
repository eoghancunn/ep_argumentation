{"speaker": "Urszula Gacek (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Urszula Gacek (PPE-DE). – Madam President, the rapporteur on the Black Sea regional policy reminds us that the European Union supports new energy infrastructure and viable transport corridors, diversifying both suppliers and routes. The prime example of such an undertaking is the Nabucco Gas Pipeline, already recognised as a priority project of European interest. It is, therefore, regrettable that this project is being undermined by an alternative Russian-Italian pipeline by the name of South Stream.\nAs a Member from Poland, I see many parallels between South Stream and the Nord Stream Baltic Gas Pipeline. Both are much more expensive than overland routes. Indeed, South Stream may prove to be USD 4 billion more expensive than Nabucco. Both may disturb the fragile ecological balance of sensitive marine environments. Furthermore, in both cases, the pipelines may be seen as a political weapon in the hands of Russia.\nNord Stream will isolate Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine; South Stream will play the same role with respect to Turkey, the South Caucasus and, possibly, Romania, which may now be bypassed in favour of Serbia. South Stream goes against the principle of energy security in Europe, based on diverse sources and routes. Thus, if South Stream does go ahead, it should not receive EU funding at any stage.\nIf Russia is going to push forward economically unviable and environmentally questionable projects, because they serve its foreign policy aims, then it should not be at our expense.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Urszula Gacek (PPE-DE). – Madam President, the rapporteur on the Black Sea regional policy reminds us that the European Union supports new energy infrastructure and viable transport corridors, diversifying both suppliers and routes.
