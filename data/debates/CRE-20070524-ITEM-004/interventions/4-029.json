Madam President, the Commission would like to emphasise its belief that there are now renewed hopes that the Kashmiri issue can be brought closer to a solution.\nBoth sides have, we believe, sent out signals that appear to be more flexible now than in the past. Nevertheless, we would expect a slow and gradual process rather than quick results.

We have not had any additional claim from either government for additional resources, but we are open to discussing this in due course if such requests come.\nThis programme will also help restore economic development and good governance in the two countries.
