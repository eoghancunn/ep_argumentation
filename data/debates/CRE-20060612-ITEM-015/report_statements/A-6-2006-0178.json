    "paragraphs": [
        "1.Reaffirms the vital role of its Committee on Petitions in reconnecting with the citizens of the EU, and in reinforcing the democratic legitimacy and accountability of the EU decision-making process in the eyes of European public opinion;\n",
        "2.Recalls that petitions also alert the European institutions as to individual citizens' expectations from EU policies and as to what extent those expectations are fulfilled;\n",
        "3.Believes that its Committee on Petitions offers citizens an important conduit for providing their feedback concerning European acts and policies, thus contributing to a strengthening of democratic control over Community legislation and its implementation at EU, national, regional and local levels;\n",
        "4.Emphasises that the petition process offers the Parliament the possibility to assess and, when necessary, to act in order to overcome ambiguities in the political objectives of the EU, as well as in loopholes in, or in the misapplication of, Community legislation by Member States;\n",
        "5.Underlines the significant role played by the Commission in providing preliminary analyses of petitions which helps the Committee to find appropriate solutions to the concerns and problems with which citizens are confronted during their everyday lives;\n",
        "6.Stresses that further cooperation between the Parliament, the Ombudsman and the Commission is mutually beneficial in fulfilling their common objectives to improving European administration and developing better quality and more citizen-inspired legislation; emphasises that common rules of conduct for all Community institutions must be established along the lines of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour drawn up by the European Ombudsman and endorsed by the European Parliament;\n",
        "7.Expresses its concern and surprise that, in this context, the Commission's 22nd annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (2004) (COM(2005)0570) fails to recognise the important role of the petitions procedure in identifying infringements because there is no reference to petitions in the body of the report, the only reference being in a table of Annex 1;\n",
        "8.Considers that the Commission should notify decisions on opening infringement proceedings before the service of a letter of formal notice, in particular when Parliament has been petitioned on the issue in question;\n",
        "9.Recommends that, whenever citizens file, on the same subject, both a petition to the Parliament and a complaint to the Commission, both procedures should be properly coordinated when dealing with the issues raised, given that the right to petition is a fundamental right, safeguarded by the Treaty, and because the Parliament provides a transparent framework for debates, which is a prerequisite for improved openness and enhanced public accountability;\n",
        "10.Expresses its growing concern at the unreasonable and excessive amount of time - often spanning several years - which the Commission takes to pursue and conclude infringement proceedings after they are eventually launched, and its dissatisfaction with the frequent examples of Member States' non-compliance with decisions of the Court of Justice; considers that this undermines the credibility of the formulation and coherent application of EC law, and that it brings discredit on the objectives of the EU:\n",
        "11.Furthermore draws attention to the importance of the quick implementation by Member States of judgments of the Court of Justice in  infringement proceedings; welcomes the stronger policy adopted by the Commission in December 2005 on bringing Member States before the Court of Justice in order that lump sums and penalty payments be imposed; believes that this policy needs to be applied with vigour to ensure EU authority and to meet the legitimate expectations of European citizens;\n",
        "12.Believes that this unacceptable situation should be further investigated by the competent committees of the Parliament with a view to recommendations being made about more distinct parliamentary involvement in infringement proceedings and a, more effective means of redress for citizens;\n",
        "13.Underlines the importance of nationally led information campaigns to facilitate a better knowledge of the substance of EC legislation, policies and objectives by citizens; which could also help to reduce the number of unfounded petitions and complaints while, at the same time, improve the ability of the Parliament and the Commission to ensure the correct application of EU law and policy in cooperation with the Member States;\n",
        "14. Recalls the key role that Member States play in correctly implementing the EC legislation and in making the EU more relevant to citizens; stresses the need for a better coordinated participation of the representatives of the Member States and their parliaments in the debates of the Committee on Petitions;\n",
        "15. Encourages fact-finding missions pursuant to Rule 192 of its Rules of Procedure, with clear aims and objectives, which are occasionally despatched to various Member Statesof the EU to investigate issues raised by petitioners, and continues to support such missions when the situation fully warrants it as they offer a clearer view of often complex problems on the ground and help raise awareness among the competent authorities, which also increase the pressure to find effective and pragmatic solutions in the interest of the citizen;\n",
        "16.Calls for the reports that are approved as a result of such missions to be forwarded to the Bureau of the Parliament, and, where required, to other committees with an interest in the issues raised, for their information;\n",
        "17.Emphasises the frequent need for a greater involvement of the Council, as an institution, in the Committee's activities and encourages its participation at the meetings of the Committee at the appropriate level, as stated in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-making, adopted on 16 December 2003 by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.\n",
        "18.Reiterates the proposal for the Council to designate a senior official to coordinate matters related to petitions, as many of the petitions may touch upon sensitive political issues related to the transposition by Member States of the EC legislation and the EU's objectives;\n",
        "19. Notes that during the first year since the enlargement of the EU to 25 Member States, the number of petitions received by the Parliament has remained relatively constant, contrary to initial expectations; however, it is inevitable that the closer the citizens of the new Member States become acquainted with the petition process, the more frequently they will make use of this right;\n",
        "20.Calls for measures to be taken both at EU and at national level by the Parliament to increase the awareness of the citizens of the EU of their rights to petition Parliament under Article 194 of the Treaty on matters within the EU's fields of activity, which concern them directly, and to emphasise also that complaints to the Ombudsman under Article 195 of the Treaty concern only allegations of maladministration within the EU institutions or bodies;\n",
        "21. Acknowledges and welcomes the steps made to strengthen the secretariat of the Committee in order to cover the need for linguistic, legal and political expertise and stresses that this process should continue, so that response times may become shorter, investigations even more effective and its service be equally available to all citizens of the EU; ; regrets, however, the permanent lack of staff in the Committee secretariat with regard to the growing number of petitions coming from the new Member States;\n",
        "22.Calls upon the Conference of Presidents to consider, at the appropriate time, a substantial increase of the membership of the Committee of Petitions to 50 full members in order to ensure that European citizens are able to obtain an even better understanding of their case in Committee, and thus allow the Parliament to better respond to the expectations of petitioners;\n",
        "23.Welcomes the introduction, in July 2005, of a new software system for petitions that functions both as a database and as a management tool providing information about the petitions workflow; and points out that the e-Petition software is accessible to Members of the Committee, their assistants as well as the political group staff and aims at further reinforcing the transparency and the efficiency of the Committee's activity;\n",
        "24.Notes that Article 230 of  the Treaty enables the Parliament to refer to the Court of Justice cases of violation of the Treaty or any other rule of law related to its application;\n",
        "25.Stresses the legitimate entitlement ofParliament to make use of its powers if this is necessary in order to bring to an end a serious infringement of Community law which has been revealed in the course of the examination of a petition;\n",
        "26.Recalls that since 1998 the European Parliament has called for a review of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1989; reiterates its urgent requests for the Council and the Commission to undertake this review with a view to (deletion) a more effective means of redress and defining a clear and coherent framework for essential cooperation between the Institutions in the area concerned;\n",
        "27.Calls upon the responsible committee, in close cooperation with the Committee on Petitions, to conduct a review of the current rules of procedure of the petitions procedure in order to bring it more into line with current best practice and reinforce procedures related to data protection and confidentiality without undermining the essential transparency of the petitions process itself;\n",
        "28.Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the report of the Committee on Petitions to the Council, the Commission, the European Ombudsman, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and their committees on petitions and ombudsmen or similar competent bodies.\n"
