{"speaker": "Alexandra Dobolyi,", "english": "Alexandra Dobolyi, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Cashman’s report, which is as good as we expected it would be. The European Union is facing a malaise in citizens’ confidence. The strongest message was the rejection of the Constitution a year ago. The message that citizens are sending is clear. They demand more transparency and more openness from us. They want politicians and institutions to show more interest in problems that affect citizens personally.\nIt is clear that various consultation exercises that have been undertaken at European level have had some effect: we are hearing the message now, but we should also listen. In order to do that, more resources must be provided for the various bodies that have the most direct contact with citizens and, without excluding any other body, personally I would start with the Committee on Petitions. As Mr Cashman’s report makes clear, the role of that committee is very significant in bringing citizens’ concerns and problems to the attention of European institutions.\nBut as well as Parliament providing more resources for the Committee on Petitions, other institutions, especially the Commission, must provide more resources for reducing delays in responding to citizens. I therefore particularly support paragraphs 20 to 23 of the report and I hope that there can be a debate in all the political groups, as well as in the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, on how to reinforce our work to assist citizens. Parliament should give that high priority during the second half of the parliamentary term.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexandra Dobolyi, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Cashman’s report, which is as good as we expected it would be.
