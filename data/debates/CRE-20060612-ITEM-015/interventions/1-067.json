{"speaker": "Diana Wallis,", "english": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman on his extensive and tough report. I would also like to welcome the supportive and reinforcing manner in which he addresses some of the items we have already addressed in the report on the monitoring of Community law.\nIt is quite clear that petitions reveal a lot of feedback from our citizens, and there are two themes I would like to pick out from the report. One is better quality and more citizen-inspired legislation, and the second is better redress mechanisms. There is a common thread running through both of these, and that is the need for more information at national level: information about EU law and policy, information about how to enforce it, about how to access justice. Too often on the committee we see citizens who have been ping-ponged back and forth between various institutions and ombudsman’s courts, not knowing which way to turn. We have to bring an end to this.\nThen the other item: clearer citizen-inspired legislation. A few weeks ago we in this Parliament supported an idea of having citizens’ summaries at the beginning of each piece of European legislation. Last week some of us were in Helsinki for meetings with the Finnish Justice Ministry. Finland already uses citizens’ summaries or executive summaries. Their guide on this says that every bill should outline the objective of the proposed legislation. Its main contents should be drafted in plain language, avoiding legal terms, avoiding professional jargon, avoiding references to other legislation, and no more than one page in length. If our legislation were properly addressed to our citizens in this way, in plain language, well, we might have rather fewer petitions!", "lang": "EN", "original": "Diana Wallis, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman on his extensive and tough report.
