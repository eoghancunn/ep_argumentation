{"speaker": "Margot Wallström,", "english": "Margot Wallström, Vice-president of the Commission . Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members for their kind words, which complement a tough report nicely.\nMrs Wallis summed up excellently what this is ultimately about. It is about better quality laws and better redress. May I say that we have taken a leaf from Finland’s book and I have proposed as part of the Internal Action Plan on Communication that we should start to produce a layman’s summary for every proposal brought forward by the Commission. We are working hard on this and I want to see it become a reality before I leave the Commission. We should be able to explain in one page, in simple, accessible language what we want to do and what our proposals are.\nWe promise to work more intensively with the Ombudsman, the Committee on Petititions and the European Parliament in making sure that our procedures are improved where necessary.\nI will end by saying that the Commission joins with you in admiring the work of the Committee on Petition’s secretariat. Thank you very much for this discussion.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Margot Wallström, Vice-president of the Commission .
