{"speaker": "Janez Potočnik,", "english": "Janez Potočnik, Member of the Commission . Madam President, without any doubt the poorest regions of Europe need attention. Some regions in Europe need special attention, for example, regions at a statistical disadvantage, the outermost and isolated regions and cities. It is important to focus on restructuring structural assistance and to pay more attention to the Lisbon goals of innovation, research and development, as these are activities which will create a solid base for the future economies of those regions. We should also pay heed to lowering energy consumption through renewable energies, which will provide a solid basis for the sustainable future of the relevant countries.\nGender mainstreaming is a horizontal principle that we will follow in all our actions undertaken under all the structural funds. Absorption capacity is something on which we are focusing constantly. All this has received, and will continue to receive, constant attention.\nSolidarity with the poorest in Europe is the backbone of the European Union, especially after the two recent enlargements. We should not deny the problems, but we should not forget the good results we have achieved in the past. It is important to talk about both successes and problems, because this is a way of securing even greater recognition for cohesion policy and eliminating future problems.\nI should like thank you for the excellent Geringer report, your comments and your critical remarks. It is our duty to address the problems of the poorest in Europe. The Commission will certainly focus on that. Solidarity should remain one of the areas where we show the human face of Europe as a whole.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Janez Potočnik, Member of the Commission .
