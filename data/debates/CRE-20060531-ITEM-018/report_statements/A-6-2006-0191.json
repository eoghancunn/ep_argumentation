    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Recalls that accession to the euro zone requires full adherence to the Maastricht criteria, as specified in the Treaty and the protocol on Article 121 of the Treaty: a high degree of price stability, a government budgetary position without an excessive deficit, membership in the exchange rate mechanism II of the EMS for at least two years and the observance of the normal fluctuation margins, the convergence of long-term interest rates, the compatibility of the system of laws with the Maastricht Treaty, an independent central bank, and economic convergence;\n",
        "2.  Recalls that all Member States with a derogation need to fulfil the Maastricht criteria before they can join the euro zone, and that the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact apply to all Members states; is convinced that an examination of Member States’ preparedness to adopt the euro shall be built on the same definitions and principles as set out in previous Convergence Reports, so as to guarantee continuity and equal treatment of all Member States;\n",
        "3.  Urges the Commission to use common criteria when assessing economic and fiscal data; points to the Commission's responsibility as far as the reliability of statistical data is concerned and insists that no decision should be taken for as long as doubts about their veracity persist; stresses that the analysis of price stability requires a broad assessment of the range of reference setting methods given the different approaches applied by the Commission to the Convergence Reports since 1993;\n",
        "4.  Strongly opposes special provisions concerning the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria and the membership of ERM II; calls on the Commission to assess the convergence criteria strictly, and that the long-term stability of the euro zone should always have priority over enlargement;\n",
        "5.. Believes that the long-term stability of the euro zone should also be assessed in terms of its capacity to absorb new entrants; underlines that this implies that the enlargement of the euro zone must not undermine the required enforcement of the economic governance within the euro zone;\n",
        "6.  Asks the authorities of the applicant Member States to ensure full transparency in their policy decisions - such as the setting of conversion rates and entry target dates - taken in prior and during ERM II membership; calls on the authorities to make available to the public any impact assessments, studies and reports related to these issues;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Member States within the euro zone to strengthen their efforts towards the effective coordination of economic and monetary policies notably trough a reinforcement of their common strategies within the Eurogroup; notes that such efforts could start with the coordination of the budgetary calendar and drafting budgets on the same hypothesis on the development of the euro-dollar exchange rate and oil price projections;\n",
        "8.  Stresses that Euro changeover should not be tackled and projected as simply a technical change in currency but as a major conversion with significant economic, monetary and social effects;\n",
        "9.  Points out that detailed national plans for the changeover are necessary for a smooth adoption of the euro; believes that these plans must list the local and national bodies responsible for implementing the introduction of the euro and must include a detailed timeframe for the amendment of national laws and administrative rules and for the adaptation of public bodies; considers that lessons learnt as a result of the introduction of the euro during the first wave of euro zone membership must be thoroughly taken into account as well as the characteristics of the transition to the euro whilst this currency is, today, already in circulation and widely used in the applicant countries;\n",
        "10. Asks Member States acceding to the euro zone to ensure the early availability to banks of euro notes, to keep the phase of dual-currency circulation short, and to organise strictly the phasing-out of national currency units in order to facilitate a smooth changeover;\n",
        "11. Asks acceding Member States to pay particular attention to consumer protection during the changeover phase; asks them to implement legislation requiring  mandatory dual-price displays for a sufficiently long period of time and to establish effective procedures for protecting consumers against unjustified price increases during the changeover phase or longer; asks for clear public campaigns which point out that the only weapon against unjustified price increases is the consumers power to choose freely their suppliers; points out that special attention should be paid to price setting in public or private monopoly situations and public authorities; invites them to put into place for a period of at least two years an observatory responsible for publishing data on the evolution of about ten particularly significant consumer prices;\n",
        "12. Recalls the necessity to start early and extensive citizen information campaigns in applicant Member States, generating confidence in the changeover process, and to ensure that the changeover phase is managed in a fair manner by all involved, with a view to making the euro a success; judges that the information deficit of citizens needs to be reduced and the use of the media for information campaigns needs to be organised at an early stage;\n",
        "13. Points out that a premature accession to the euro zone might lead to unexpected developments in the economic convergence process;\n",
        "14. Points out thatthe enlargement of theeuro zone facilitates economic convergence process and contributesto strengthening of theeurozone as a whole;\n",
        "15. Notes that economic convergence has not progressed far enough to allow rapid accession  in some of the applicant Member States, as demonstrated by high inflation rates and excessive fiscal deficits observed in some candidate countries; recognises that several Member States have built a solid base for the rapid euro introduction by ensuring a long term fiscal sustainability;\n",
        "16. Requests that all criteria be completely fulfilled before adopting the euro and points out that not all seven ERM II Member States without an opt-out clause have reached the conditions for accession;\n",
        "17. Recalls that in absence of an opt-out clause the Treaty foresees automatic assessment of the Maastricht criteria for countries with a derogation on a bi-annual basis; notes that countries with a derogation are allowed to request an assessment to be carried out before the expiry of such a deadline; urges countries to refrain from doing so as long as they are not certain to fulfil all the criteria;\n",
        "18. Observes that despite continuous high growth for last ten years, real convergence is still weak;\n",
        "19. Is of the opinion that in any cases the decision on  the accession of the individual member states should be based on high-quality data and evaluation following provisions of the Treaty and relevant protocols in this respect; therefore, calls on the Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to make a comprehensive evaluation which would be more than just a formal comparison of numbers and figures and to take into account the  track records of convergence and achievements in ensuring macroeconomic stability;\n",
        "20. Considers that it is in the interest of the new Member Statesand of theeurozone as a wholeto conduct a careful analysis of the costs and benefits of adopting the euro at an early stage, in particular taking into account that membership of the Euro zone has important consequences in termsof monetary policyinstruments and requires an appropriate degree of room for fiscal policy, which remains the macro economic instrument available; calls on these analyses to be made public;\n",
        "21. Considers that preparing for membership of the euro zone can bring substantial benefits in itself after the accession to the ERM, that the date of entry should not be the main focus, and that a credible and sustainable way forward is very important, in order to ensure that the implementation of the euro in new member states will be a success;\n",
        "22. Points out that the inflation criterion requires an inflation rate that does not exceed by more than 1,5 percentage points that of the three best-performing Member States as regards price stability, with consumer prices of the previous 12 months being the basis for establishing the average, on the basis of data provided by the ECB;\n",
        "23. Points out that the applicants for accession should have an average nominal long-term interest-rate, observed over a period of one year prior to their application, which does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of the three best-performing Member States as regards price stability, on the basis of data provided by the ECB;\n",
        "24. Points out that both the definition of the three best performing member states in terms of price stability as well as the method of calculating the reference value need to be clarified to reflect the fact that twelve EU member states form now the monetary union and use one single currency which is managed by common monetary policy, and that the differentials in their individual inflation performance reflect structural factors rather than differences in macroeconomic policy stances; considers, however, that it is important to take into account the so called Balassa-Samuelson-effect with respect to the inflation criteria for emerging Member States;\n",
        "25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the ECB. .\n"
