        "7.  Recalls the ‘specific nature’ of women’s prisons and insists that security and reintegration arrangements aimed at women should be put in place;\n",
        "8.  Asks Member States to incorporate gender equality into their prison policies and detention centres and to take greater account of women’s specific circumstances and the often traumatic past of women prisoners, in particular through awareness-raising and appropriate training for medical and prison staff and the re-education of women in fundamental values by: a) incorporating gender mainstreaming into data collection wherever possible to            render visible the problems and needs of women; b) setting up, in each Member State, an investigatory committee and permanent                       monitoring systems for an effective assessment of prison conditions, in order to be   able to detect and remedy any aspects of discrimination still affecting women in the   prison system; c) highlighting in local, regional and national debates the needs of women prisoners        and former prisoners to encourage positive measures in relation to social resources,   housing and training etc.\n",

        "11. Asks Member States to adopt a comprehensive prison health policy that allows the identification and treatment of physical and mental disorders occurring following imprisonment and to provide medical and psychological assistance to all prisoners, male and female, suffering from addictions, with respect, however, for women’s specific circumstances;\n",
        "12. Asks Member States to take all measures necessary to provide psychological support to all women prisoners and, in particular, those that have been the victims of violence or mistreatment, mothers raising children alone and juvenile offenders, in order to assure them better protection and improve their family and social relations and, therefore, their chances with regard to social reintegration; recommends that prison staff should receive training on and be made aware of the particular vulnerability of these prisoners;\n",
        "13. Recommends that the imprisonment of pregnant women and mothers with young children should only be considered as a last resort and that, in this extreme case, they should be entitled to a more spacious cell, an individual cell if possible, and should be given particular attention, especially in terms of diet and hygiene; considers, furthermore, that pregnant women should receive antenatal and postnatal care and parenting classes of a standard equivalent to those provided outside the prison environment;\n",
        "14. Draws attention to the fact that when women have healthy deliveries in prison, forced separation from the infant usually comes within twenty-four to seventy-two hours after the birth and welcomes any alternative solution from the Commission and the Member States;\n",

        "16. Recommends that alternative penalties to imprisonment, such as community-based sentences, should be favoured to a greater extent, particularly for mothers, provided that the sentence imposed is short and the risk to public safety low, where their imprisonment could result in serious disruptions to family life, in particular if they are single parents or have young children, or are responsible for looking after dependent or incapacitated persons; underlines that the judicial authorities should take account of these factors, in particular the best interests of the child(ren) of the defendant, when deciding on the sentence; recommends, likewise, considering the possibility of adopting similar measures as those established for mothers for male prisoners with custody of children or who have other family responsibilities;\n",

        "18. Insists, moreover, on the need for the judiciary to ascertain whether there are children to consider before taking a decision to remand a defendant in custody, and when issuing the sentence, and to ensure that measures are taken to guarantee their rights in full;\n",
        "19. Asks Member States to increase the number of women’s detention centres and to spread them more evenly across their territory so that it is easier for women prisoners to maintain family ties and friendships and take part in religious services;\n",
        "20. Recommends that Member States should encourage penal institutions to adopt flexible rules concerning arrangements for the frequency, duration and scheduling of visits that family members, friends and others should be entitled to make;\n",
        "21. Asks Member States to make it easier for families to stay in touch, in particular imprisoned parents and their children, unless this is counter to the children’s best interests, by creating a visiting environment with an atmosphere distinct from that of prison in general that allows joint activities and appropriate emotional contact;\n",
        "22. Urges Member States to fulfil their international obligations[13]by ensuring equal rights and treatment for children residing with their imprisoned parent and to create living conditions adapted to their needs through the provision of separate cells removed, where possible, from the ordinary prison environment, through their attendance of local nurseries or schools and through flexible and generous arrangements for outings with other family members or with child protection officials, enabling their healthy physical, mental, emotional and social development, and with suitable facilities and qualified staff to assist prisoners who are mothers with their parental responsibilities and the necessary care; recommends also that, in the case of minors residing in prison, the other parent should be able to exercise his or her parental authority;\n",
        "23. Notes with regret that many of the women in prison are single mothers and they lose contact with their children, sometimes forever; asks the Commission and the Member States to deliver and implement alternative policies in order to avoid total separation;\n",
        "24. Urges Member States to guarantee free legal assistance for all prisoners on matters relating to imprisonment, which, in the case of women prisoners, should be specifically geared to family law in order to address issues relating to fostering, adoption, legal separation and gender violence etc.\n",

        "26. Asks Member States to provide psycho-social treatment to ensure the best possible preparation for the separation of women prisoners from their children and to lessen the negative impact;\n",

        "28. Asks Member States to invest more resources, including through the application of Community financial instruments such as the European Social Fund and PROGRESS, for the development in prisons of lifelong literacy and education programmes and vocational training adapted to job market requirements and possibly leading to a qualification;\n",
        "29. Stresses that these programmes should include language courses, including the teaching of the national language in question (or at least one of them) for the benefit of foreign prisoners, information technology courses and courses in social and professional behaviour;\n",
        "30. Underlines the fundamental role of non-governmental organisations in the social and professional reintegration of prisoners, in particular women, and therefore asks Member States to encourage the development of these organisations’ activities in the prison environment, including by increasing the funding allocated to NGOs, making the conditions for access to prison by NGO members less rigid and raising the awareness of prison staff as regards the need for good cooperation with these organisations;\n",
        "31. Considers that, except in cases of high risk to public safety and long sentences, greater use of semi-custodial arrangements allowing male and female prisoners to work or take vocational training outside prison walls could aid their social and professional reintegration;\n",
        "32. Stresses that working conditions for male and female prisoners, in particular pregnant women and women who have just given birth, should be in conformity with national and Community legislation, and regularly monitored by the competent authorities;\n",
        "33. Underlines the need to encourage the involvement of male and female prisoners in a programme aimed at professional development and social reintegration, in particular by means of a personal report and by ensuring that these efforts are assessed annually;\n",
        "34. Considers it a matter of priority to ensure that, in each detention centre, male and female prisoners who so wish have access to personal guidance and mentoring for the planning, realisation and completion of their personal development and social reintegration, which should continue following their release from prison;\n",
        "35. Recalls the need to apply social assistance measures, during imprisonment and afterwards, aimed at preparing prisoners for and helping them with reintegration, in particular as regards finding accommodation and employment, so as to prevent social exclusion and repeat offences;\n",
        "36. Underlines the importance of maintaining and promoting male and female prisoners' contact with the outside world, including through access to the written press and to the media and through communication with social assistance bodies, NGOs and cultural, artistic and other organisations approved by the prison authorities;\n",
        "37. Stresses that regular access for all prisoners to sports and recreational activities, and to artistic and cultural education opportunities, is crucial to maintaining their psychological wellbeing and improving their chances with regard to social reintegration;\n",

        "39. Recommends that Member States should pay special attention to male and female prisoners of foreign nationality, in particular as regards linguistic and cultural differences, help these prisoners remain in contact with their relatives and grant them access to contact with their consulates, to prison resources and programmes, and to understandable information; also recommends that they should take into account the specificity of foreign women in the planning of prison activities, train agents for working in a multicultural context, both in and out of prison, and provide mediation services in and out of prison;\n",
        "40. Asks Member States, in the aim of social and professional reintegration, to take all measures necessary to incorporate into their national legislation provisions favouring the recruitment of female former prisoners, in particular mothers raising children alone and juvenile offenders, in both the public and private sector;\n",
        "41. Encourages Member States to exchange information and best practice in relation to prison conditions, in particular those for women, and regarding the effectiveness of vocational training and social reintegration measures; considers it important, therefore, to encourage and finance the involvement of the authorities and actors on the ground in the creation of innovative programmes and best practices as well as in national and international conferences and debates, as a means of providing motivation and generating positive cooperation;\n",
        "42. Asks the Commission, together with the Member States to promote the carrying-out of prison-related research from a gender point of view and to fund studies on the causes of crime and the effectiveness of penal systems, with a view to improving the participation of prisoners, male and female, in social, family and working life\n",
        "43. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the parliaments and governments of the Member States and accession and candidate countries.\n"
