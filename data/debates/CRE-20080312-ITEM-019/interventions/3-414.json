And here, of course, comes the issue of children. Separation of a mother and her baby in prison often occurs just hours after birth. This will immediately have an impact on any chance for a wholesome relationship between the two. In order to ultimately create that special mother-child bond, it is necessary for both to grow together. And the only way in which two will grow together in a healthy and normal way is by keeping them together wherever possible and creating a supported and secure environment for them to live in.\nTo separate a mother and baby is to set their relationship up for failure. Why would we do this, when what most of these women need most is a stable, loving relationship in their life?", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, many women in prison have a background of violence and abuse, which can make it difficult for them to create stable relationships – which in the end is truly what they need.\nOur goal should not only be the social integration of prisoners, but their personal development.
