I think the report could be strengthened through a couple of amendments.\nEmphasis should be placed on the concept of relocation as a more exact description of the preparation process as the women approach their release date. In order to help with this, there should be ‘halfway houses’ which have appropriate, supportive surroundings.\nI urge support for the amendments which seek an end to the confinement of girls in adult prisons. The staff in women’s prison should be women as far as possible, including medical staff.\nA report was published in 2004 and another last year detailing the horrible conditions of the average female prisoner in my own constituency in Northern Ireland. I would advise the Commission to read the recommendations made in that report as well as the recommendations made in this report.", "lang": "GA", "original": "Bairbre de Brún (GUE/NGL). – (GA) Mr President, I welcome Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's own-initiative report on the examination of the situation of women in prison.
