    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the broad scientific and political consensus on the seriousness of climate change; urges the conclusion of an ambitious, worldwide post-Kyoto agreement, in line with the scenario of IPCC Working group III, on the need to limit temperature increases to 2°C and for corresponding adjustments to be made to other international agreements concerning trade, civil aviation and intellectual property; considers that a post-2012 framework should allow different countries to participate, according to their national circumstances, through a short-term, multi-stage approach and that, in the medium-term, emissions should be allocated on a per capita basis, first to developed countries, but eventually to all countries; calls on the Council and the Commission working towards building a consensus on a post-2012 framework through broadening engagement, to include key parties currently outside of the Kyoto Protocol, notably the US and Australia, and to collaborate with individual states and businesses in the absence of a commitment made by governments;\n",
        "2.  Considers that the EU and its Member States must seek to rigorously apply the Kyoto Protocol's enforcement mechanism procedure, when it comes into force, in order to ensure that countries that have not accepted targets or are not meeting them do not enjoy an unfair advantage; considers that where a country exceeds its allowed emissions in the first commitment period, it should be required to make up the difference in the second commitment period, plus a penalty deduction of 30%;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the Clean Development Mechanism within the Kyoto Protocol as an incentive for investment in developing countries that reduce carbon emissions but notes that it is not yet sufficient to significantly shift investment patterns in those sectors that have the greatest impact on climate change, such as power generation, transport and industrial energy use; considers that, in order to rectify this, the EU should take the lead amongst the developed world in increasing the resources available through the Global Environment Facility;\n",
        "4.  Considers that the current economic model, which entails constant maximisation of consumption, production and trade, is unsustainable as this results in ever-increasing demand for resources and transport and a growing quantity of waste and emissions, which undermines the prospects of curbing the climate changes currently taking place;\n",
        "5.  Considers that increasing trade should be regarded as a positive factor for economic growth and citizens' well-being, once the problems relating  to climate change have been taken into account; is worried that the increased volume of trade is making a substantial contribution to climate change and considers that trade policy must therefore provide part of the solution; emphasises that, given the growing consensus on the urgency to tackle climate change, the EU must increasingly implement trade and investment policies that create economic incentives to meet climate change policy objectives; stresses that the EU may need to use these rules to create economic disincentives for climate-unfriendly activity; however this must not be used as an excuse for protectionist policies against developing countries;\n",
        "6.  Regrets that the current trading system produces a global division of labour which is based on a very high input of transport - which does not bear its own environmental costs - of homogeneous products which could just as easily be produced locally;\n",
        "7.  Points out that, whilst trade can make a significant contribution to economic development and human prosperity at the same time the transport sector (principally road transport), which enables trade in goods and raw materials to take place, is responsible for one third of global greenhouse gas emissions; considers that measures to drive a modal shift to more environmentally-friendly transport modes (such as rail and water-borne transport) and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport are imperative;\n",
        "8.  Considers that the EU, as a global trade partner, is well placed to contribute to a worldwide shift in production and transport patterns; considers that a front-running Europe would be in a more competitive situation when stricter regulations are adopted worldwide;\n",
        "9.  Recalls that the dismantling of administrative barriers to trade, and action to combat climate change, can only be achieved through the broadest possible international collaboration, this being also in the essential interests of the EU, which plays a leading role in both these fields, particularly with a view to retaining European competitiveness;\n",
        "10. Stresses the need for strong cooperation between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Climate Change Convention and the WTO, and asks the Commission to develop an initiative to support this aim; asks for swift progress to be made in updating the WTO’s definition of environmental goods and services, particularly in the current Doha Round negotiations, in order to reach agreement on the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to ‘green goods and services’; calls on the Commission to build a consensus on granting Multilateral Environment Agreement (MEA) Secretariats observer status at all meetings of the WTO, which are relevant to MEA issues; stresses that a lasting solution must contain a strong political message that respects an appropriate division of labour between the WTO and MEA regimes, based on core competencies; is convinced of the need to redefine the responsibilities of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment; recommends launching a study on  possible amendments to the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) in order to allow for the compulsory licensing of environmentally necessary technologies, within the framework of clear and stringent rules for the protection of intellectual property, and the strict monitoring of their implementation worldwide;\n",
        "11. Insists that obligations under MEAs, such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or its Kyoto Protocol, must be complied with and that the narrow interpretation of trade rules must not be allowed to prevent or obstruct the  attainment of their objectives;\n",
        "12. Believes that WTO rules should not prevent Member States from encouraging the further development of low-energy technologies by insisting on technical neutrality, which could undermine incentives for the development of renewable technology;\n",
        "13. Asks the Commission to take initiatives at the international level, and particularly within the WTO, to ensure that trade policy as a whole, and in relation to trade volume trends, takes account of its potential impact on climate change;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that EU bilateral trade agreements and WTO multilateral trade agreements are concluded in keeping with those provisions of the Agreement establishing the WTO, which specify that international trade should be conducted while allowing for the optimal use of the world’s resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment;\n",
        "15. Calls furthermore on the Council and the Commission to ensure that the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) acts in accordance with Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which allows its members to take measures, including protectionist measures, necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health or relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources;\n",
        "16. Notes that the EU is already a world leader in alternative energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines and that, thanks to efficient and technologically innovative European undertakings, the EU should be a market leader in the worldwide export of environmental goods and services (EGS) and that  Galileo and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security System (GMES) could be used to monitor CO2emissions;\n",
        "17. Urges the EU, with a view to achieving the Lisbon objectives, to develop and promote 'climate-friendly industry' at a global level particularly as trade is an important tool for the transfer of technology to developing countries; emphasises the need to reduce barriers to \"green trade\" by, for example, removing tariffs on \"green goods\" at the WTO level, reshaping the rules on intellectual property rights (IPR), facilitating the market entry of green technology by allowing climate concerns to guide export credit guarantees, as well as by removing perverse incentives and distortions of the market, such as fossil fuel subsidies;\n",
        "18. Calls for the establishment of an International Environmental Organisation which would assume responsibility for compliance with international treaties and agreements on environmental protection and combating climate change, and which would, inter alia, work and cooperate with the WTO on issues concerning the impact of trade on the environment;\n",
        "19. Recognises that the EU bears a historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and realises that substantial changes to its trade policy are required to encourage local production as a means of reducing the need for transport; stresses the need for more intensive technological cooperation with developing and emerging countries, particularly China, Brazil and India, in order to enable them to mainstream environmental protection in their policies; regrets, however, that existing technology-transfer mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are insufficient and therefore calls for increased co-financing and capacity building measures;\n",
        "20. Notes that the transfer of energy efficient and other environmentally friendly technologies from the EU to developing countries has a crucial role to play in decoupling economic development from greenhouse gas emissions and that suitable investment is needed to promote such a reduction;\n",
        "21. Asks the Commission to systematically include environmental protection clauses, with special reference to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, in its trade agreements with third countries; calls for the transfer of low carbon technology and low carbon trade schemes to developing countries; asks the competent Commission services to swiftly develop a climate change dimension in its Sustainability Impact Assessments, to discuss them with Parliament, and to apply them systematically before the conclusion of these agreements;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that the negotiations on  the new generation of Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with partners in Asia and Latin America include commitments to the social and environmental aspects of trade and sustainable development and to the effective implementation of MEAs; suggests that liberalising trade in renewable goods and technologies and increasing access to environmental services should be a key objective of  the Commission in the forthcoming FTA negotiations;  stresses the need to introduce WTO-compatible Green Government Procurement policies systematically into bilateral agreements;\n",
        "23. Calls for in-depth impact analyses, from a climate, gender and sustainability perspective, of the outcome of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements negotiated between the EU and third countries and urges the Commission to authorise explicit support for the management of climate change as part of all aid-for-trade and other relevant development aid;\n",
        "24. Supports the Commission’s proposal to establish in each trade agreement a Sustainable Development Forum, with a strong climate component, which would be open to participation by elected representatives and by civil society (particularly NGOs operating in the environmental field) and other key stakeholders and calls for this to be ensured during ongoing negotiations;\n",
        "25. Stresses the need to broaden the Environmental Policy Dialogues as well as the Energy Policy Dialogue that form part of EU agreements with third countries or regions to cover questions of climate change and asks the Commission to put forward concrete proposals for benchmarks for progress according to the type of country;\n",
        "26. Considers that the conservation of ecosystems which play a valuable role as carbon sinks and biodiversity reserves represent global public goods and need special protection and international financial support; proposes including the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Partnership Agreements in all existing and future agreements with third countries;\n",
        "27. Recognises that trade too often leads to overexploitation of eco-systems, particularly forests, in developing countries; urges industrialised countries to take responsibility for the widespread deforestation caused by international trade; emphasises the significant climate impact of deforestation and therefore the long-term economic value and importance of preserving forests intact; calls for serious EU efforts to establish reward mechanisms for “avoided deforestation” in the international climate negotiations, along with other strong policy measures to promote responsible trade in natural resources;\n",
        "28. Supports the Commission proposal to enhance cooperation with developing countries in areas of climate change adaptation and mitigation through setting up a Global Climate Policy Alliance; stresses that intensifying dialogue and moving towards the development and implementation of joint programmes in areas of mutual environmental concern, such as climate change, waste management and illegal logging, with key emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, Ukraine and South Africa, must be a priority for the EU and its Member States;\n",
        "29. Calls for the discontinuation of public support, via export credit agencies and public investment banks, for fossil fuel projects and for the redoubling of efforts to increase the transfer of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies;\n",
        "30. Asks the Commission and the Member States to propose legislative instruments in order that Member State Export Credit Agencies and the European Investment Bank take account of the climate change implications of the funded projects when making or guaranteeing loans and impose a moratorium on funding until sufficient data are available, in accordance with advice from the OECD, G8 and the Extractive Industries Review;\n",
        "31. suggests amending the WTO subsidies agreement in order to reintroduce a clause providing for the non-action ability of certain environmental subsidies;\n",
        "32. Repeats the need for a 30% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, independent of third countries’ commitments;\n",
        "33. Stresses the need to raise public awareness of consumer products' total environmental costs; calls on the Commission and the Council to propose measures for the provision of information on the energy consumed, and greenhouse gases emitted, during the manufacture and transport of products placed on sale within the EU, such as the proposal made by the UK Government to introduce carbon footprint product labels displaying the level of CO2emission caused by the production, transport and eventual disposal of a product;\n",
        "34. Insists on the introduction of WTO compatible common standards and labelling schemes regarding the GHG implications of different products, including at the production and transport stages, as part of a wider consumer information policy, thereby giving consumers the opportunity to contribute to reducing CO2emissions;\n",
        "35. Asks the Commission urgently to draw up an adequate procedure to assess and label these ecological footprints and to develop software in order to enable businesses to calculate the quantity of GHG emitted from every production process;\n",
        "36. Stresses that efforts need to be made to internalise external influences linked to trade (such as harmful consequences for the environment), in other words to convert them into a price indication which the market can understand, and to promote fair competition by putting into practice the “polluter pays” principle (particularly in the areas of road and air traffic), ideally through the global extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme;\n",
        "37. Notes the inseparable link between trade and the transport sector; urges that consideration be given to all means of  transport and in particular those whose emissions have increased significantly in recent years, namely shipping (whose carbon dioxide emissions are thought to be double those of aviation and could rise by as much as 75% in the next 15 to 20 years);\n",
        "38. Welcomes, within the framework of the 'footprint' approach, the  eventual integration of airplanes landing in Europewithin the European Emission Trading System; calls for the proposal to include the marine transport sector in this system to be examined;\n",
        "39. Recognises the promotion of ICT-based solutions, the internalisation of the environmental costs of transport in fuel prices, as well as the promotion of rail transport and coastal shipping, sustainable biofuels and the rapid integration of aviation in a rigorously designed EU Emissions Trading Scheme, as key measures for reducing the impact of trade and transport on the climate; calls on the Commission and the Council to  propose measures to promote and choose the least polluting modes of transport, particularly by drawing up provisions relating to the various market instruments;\n",
        "40. Urges that aid granted to the transport sector be calculated taking into account the environmental impact of the different modes  of transport, and that consideration be given to using market-compatible trade instruments (such as labelling and standards) which promote climate protection;\n",
        "41. Considers that, given that the real carbon cost of road transport is not known, especially in the case of food and other daily consumables, support schemes to promote sustainable local production should be regarded as acceptable and promoted so as to discourage the excessive transport by road of food; also recommends the introduction of climate labelling standards in order to inform consumers of the ecological footprint of products;\n",
        "42. Is especially concerned by the potential negative, environmental and social impact of policies encouraging biofuel and biomass use in Europe; reiterates its earlier call for the mandatory, social and environmental certification of biofuels (or their feedstocks) as a condition for their use and for their compliance with EU targets;\n",
        "43. Calls for all agreements on the purchase of biofuels to be subject to clauses seeking to protect areas given over to biodiversity and human food production;\n",
        "44. Calls on the Commission to assess the climate impact of EU imports of soya and palm oil, taking into account their effects on tropical deforestation, and to take measures to incorporate the climate cost in prices;\n",
        "45. Asks the Commission to encourage  a European movement for best practice and benchmarking  in relation to the climate change aspects of location, with particular reference to an ever more geographically fragmented production chain and 'just in time' production, and to forward related proposals;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Commission to examine WTO-compatible mechanisms and climate-friendly trade policies in order to address the issue of third countries which are not bound by the Kyoto Protocol and to work towards making more explicit provision for such possibilities in future versions of the Protocol; considers that trade measures should be  taken only when alternative measures would be ineffective in achieving a given environmental objective; considers that the trade measures used should be no more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve the objective and should not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination; regards border tax adjustments as a legitimate way of moving towards a low-carbon economy, levelling the playing field between post-Kyoto signatories and other States and discouraging relocation and considers that the beginning of the post-Kyoto period should be the starting-point for such measures;\n",
        "47. Recommends the development, in the longer term, of a scheme based on sound life-cycle data which  includes finished goods, such as cars and electronic equipment, in this adjustment where necessary;\n",
        "48. Insists that future proposals must be fully in accordance with the EU’s international obligations, particularly those imposed by the WTO, including Article XX of GATT;\n",
        "49. Stresses at the same time that when trade defence instruments are reformed they should take account of the feasibility of introducing environmental factors in order to avoid the environmental dumping of products originating from countries that do not ratify the post-Kyoto protocol;\n",
        "50. Calls for incentives for the production, through granting State or Community aid, and use, through reductions in value added tax, of products which help to reduce CO2emissions; o o    o\n",
        "51. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
