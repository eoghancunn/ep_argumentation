    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Believes that mobility has been one of the greatest achievements and challenges of the 20th century and that sustainable transport should strike a fair balance between different and often conflicting interests while seeking to reconcile mobility, a basic right that citizens enjoy, the importance of the transport sector in economic and employment terms, the responsibility for the local and global environment and the right of citizens to safety, quality of life and health;\n",
        "2.  Points to the importance of the transport sector for employment, growth, and innovation, and considers safe and affordable guaranteed mobility to be asine qua nonof our lifestyle; consequently believes – without detracting from the priority that should be accorded to the requirements of sustainable mobility from an environmental point of view – that citizens are unlikely to support extreme measures[7];\n",
        "3.  Is of the opinion that, to achieve the aim of making European transport sustainable in energy and environmental terms, it is necessary to combine a range of mutually supportive and corrective policies, thus securing the involvement of more and more stakeholders representing the transport sector, government, and citizens; is convinced that only by applying the right combination of measures will it be possible both to mitigate the adverse effects of individual actions and to help persuade citizens to accept those actions;\n",
        "4.  Considers that a policy mix of this kind should encompass the following in particular: (a) technological developments (measures to increase energy efficiency; new standards/regulations for engines and fuels; use of new technologies and alternative fuels); (b) market-based instruments (charges/fares based on environmental impact or congestion, tax incentives, Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) allowing for the specific features of the different modes of transport); and (c) flanking measures to enable means of transport and infrastructure to be used as efficiently as possible and encourage companies and citizens to change their ways.\n",
        "5.   Maintains that the EU and the Member States need to focus their efforts on the key elements of the system, namely: (a) congested large cities and urban areas, where most movements take place; (b)  the main European intercity corridors, the routes for the highest proportion of EU internal and international trade; and (c) environmentally sensitive areas (the Alpine region, the Baltic Sea, etc.).\n",
        "6.   Draws attention to its abovementioned resolution on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2emissions  in support of a legislative framework to reduce emissions to 125 g CO2/km for new cars, to be achieved by making technological improvements to vehicle engines, and to provide for a further cut of 10 g CO2/km by means of other technological improvements and greater use of biofuels;\n",
        "7.   Maintains that market-based instruments should likewise be employed to promote vehicles with low fuel consumption and low emissions, making use of, for example, tax exemptions, reform of vehicle excise duties to take account of pollutant emissions and fuel consumption efficiency, incentives to scrap highly polluting vehicles and buy low-emission new cars; considers these to be important measures that would also help motor manufacturers to recoup the cost of compliance with the obligations imposed by the new legislative framework;\n",
        "8.   Urges the Council and the Member States, therefore, to match the determination shown at the European Council meeting of 8 and 9 March 2007 by (a) adopting the abovementioned proposal for a Directive on Passenger Car-Related Taxes in order to link car-related taxation to pollutant emissions and fuel consumption efficiency; and (b) reforming their tax systems, without further delay, in such a way as to provide more substantial incentives in favour of cleaner vehicles.\n",
        "9.   Endorses the question raised by the Commission in the abovementioned Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes, regarding the option of using a coordination procedure and exchange of experience and best practice in order to promote, while bringing more active scrutiny to bear on, national reforms of transport charging systems and environmental taxation; calls on the Commission to take steps to achieve that end;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Council and the Member States to step up their investment in infrastructure and intelligent transport systems (ITS's), in particular with a view to: (a) completing the trans-European network priority projects as soon as possible, since these are vitally important for freight transport logistics and a sustainable European transport policy; (b) tackling congestion in urban areas and along corridors in sensitive areas; and (c) improving intermodal transport;\n",
        "11. Urges the Commission to submit by June 2008 at the latest, a comprehensible, transparent, generally applicable model for assessing the external costs of all modes of transport, on which to base future calculation of the charges to be paid for the use of infrastructure; observes that, under Directive 2006/38/EC, that model must be accompanied by an analysis of the impact of  internalising external costs for all modes of transport and by a strategy for phasing in the model for all modes of transport; looks to the Commission, alongside the above initiative to produce legislative proposals, starting with the revision of the Eurovignette Directive;\n",
        "12. Is convinced that the problem of urban congestion, which causes 40% of CO2emissions and 70% of other pollutant emissions from vehicles, needs to be tackled more ambitiously, without infringing the subsidiarity principle, by applying a Europe-wide cooperation and coordination strategy;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to analyse the way in which transport infrastructure and the tariffs applied to it influence urban development and future demand for transport services;\n",
        "14. Is of the opinion that an effective urban mobility policy should take into account the transport of persons as well as of freight and must therefore be based on as fully integrated an approach as possible, bringing together the solutions best suited to each individual problem; firmly believes that urban areas have economically sound potential to offer for further modal shift policies in favour of public transport, walking, and cycling and for a new approach to urban logistics; considers it essential in this connection to focus on technological innovation (wider use of (ITS's)), better exploitation of existing infrastructure, especially by means of demand management measures (congestion charges and road pricing), and innovative solutions for the optimum integration of urban freight flows; and, lastly, new ways to optimise the use of private cars such as car-sharing,  carpooling and arrangements for working at home;\n",
        "15. Points to the importance of light measures in attaining the goal of more sustainable transport and considers it important that citizens should be able to make informed choices about means of transport and driving behaviour; calls for better consumer information and for more active education and promotion campaigns in support of more sustainable means of transport or transport models;\n",
        "16. Believes that rail transport – a mode with lower energy consumption and CO2emissions (not least because it uses nuclear-generated electricity) – has considerable untapped potential not just where freight transport logistics are concerned, but also as regards short- to medium-haul passenger transport;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission, the Member States, and the rail industry to: (a)  complete a single European railway area or rail market as soon as possible; (b)  with that end in view, eliminate the technical obstacles and move towards a single European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and interoperable solutions; and (c)  improve freight and passenger transport services and the quality of service.\n",
        "18. Considers that, although airlines have cut their fuel consumption by 1%-2% per passenger-kilometre in the last ten years and noise emissions have been greatly lowered, the overall environmental impact of civil aviation has risen on account of the substantial expansion in traffic; calls, therefore for: (a)  air transport to be included in the ETS and greater use to be made of the new-generation European air traffic management system (SESAR - Single European Sky ATM Research); (b)   emissions-based differential take-off and landing charges at airports; (c) the establishment of the 'Clean Sky a Joint Technology Initiative' that aims at reducing CO2and NOxemissions and noise pollution; (d)   an end to the fragmentation of European airspace through the speedy creation of a real Single European Sky; (e)    practical steps to be taken to relieve airport congestion; and (f)    ensuring better co-modal and logistics integration of airports, facilitating their access to railways;\n",
        "19. Notes that emissions from shipping are continuing to increase and recommends in particular that: (a)  CO2, SO2, nitrogen oxide, and other emissions from ships be reduced; (b)  the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power be started and encouraged; (c)  vessels that come to anchor to be fuelled from land-based sources; (d)  the use of emission allowance trading to contain emissions be treated as a possibility deserving careful consideration, without punishing this mode of transport which is the most environmentally friendly (together with inland waterways) nor favour other modes which impose a heavier burden on the environment; and (e)  an integrated European rivers policy  to be agreed and therefore endorses initiatives such as NAIADES (An Integrated European Action Programme for Inland Waterway Transport), which further improve  inland waterway transport and the environmental performance of inland waterway transport;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to invest in the modernisation of port facilities both for the EU’s seaports and for those located on internal waterways, in order to permit the swift transfer of goods and passengers from one transport system to another, thereby enabling a reduction in energy consumption in the field of transport;\n",
        "21. Considers it essential to improve logistics, load factors in freight transport and intermodal transport; therefore advocates full completion of the internal market in transport and urges the Commission to build as soon as possible on its abovementioned action plan for freight transport logistics in Europe, placing particular emphasis on developing the concept of ‘green corridors';\n",
        "22.    Calls on the Commission and the Member States to invest more in research in the field of transport, to enable  more energy-efficient and CO2-emission-reducing technologies to be developed; calls on the Commission in the 2009 review of the multi-annual financial framework to increase significantly the overall financial effort towards R&D concerning the environment, energy and transport;\n",
        "23. Gives the Commission backing for initiatives which interlink sustainable transport and tourism more effectively, such as the use of more environmentally friendly means of transport, e.g. combining public-transport use and cycling;\n",
        "24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
