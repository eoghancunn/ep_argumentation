I believe that this Report gives a realistic overview of the challenges facing us as we try to devise a suitable transport policy.\nI would like to welcome the pledge on intermodal transport. I come from an island where the economy is dependent on sea and air routes and I believe that this infrastructure should be connected to rail transport. However, this is not the case in Ireland. Rail transport isn’t used to carry freight. Since 1990 energy consumption has increased by 225% because of road transport. In terms of the Kyoto Agreement, we are falling short.\nIt is clear that there is a need for a great deal of investment in mixed transport in Ireland. However, that will not happen until the local authorities and governments change their outlook and policies. While these policies favour increased investment in roads, they neglect the development of rail transport in not only towns and cities, but in rural areas as well.\nIn conclusion, I advise the Commission to recognize the right of every Member State to set their own congestion charges and taxes.", "lang": "GA", "original": "Jim Higgins (PPE-DE). − (GA) Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Albertini for presenting us with a very important and comprehensive Report.
