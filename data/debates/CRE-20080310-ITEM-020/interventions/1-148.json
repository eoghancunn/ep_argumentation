{"speaker": "Michael Henry Nattrass,", "english": "Michael Henry Nattrass, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, the UK should make its own laws, so I reject this proposal. But I do not dispute the fact that more efficient cars are a good idea and that working from home cuts down pollution.\nWhat concerns me about this report is words like ‘pricing policy’ and ‘tax on fossil fuels’, because no current serious alternatives exist and these taxes are very inflationary. The future must be about encouraging innovation and technology, not about tricking people who have no alternative into paying more tax. Most public transport systems are good for the commuter but do not fit the needs of the businessman who must drive into work in order to use his car to visit clients later.\nBut the city of Strasbourg provides a first-class tram system, with a tram stop outside this very building, so why are MEPs here in Strasbourg not leading by example? They do not visit clients, they just come here to misrule Europe. Yet almost all of them use chauffeur-driven limousines and ignore the trams. If MEPs complied with their own words, then perhaps the public would listen. In simple English, Madam President, this House is guilty of gross hypocrisy. What were MEPs saying about sustainable transport, please? Because, like the no-smoking rule in the Parliament dining rooms, MEPs ignore it!", "lang": "EN", "original": "Michael Henry Nattrass, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Madam President, the UK should make its own laws, so I reject this proposal.
