{"speaker": "Robert Evans,", "english": "Robert Evans, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Madam President, as we have heard from Mr Albertini and the Commissioner, this is a very timely and important report and we welcome it. In his introductory remarks, Mr Albertini said that this gives us a chance to outline our transport policy, bearing in mind the environment and fuel efficiency, something about which this Parliament has consistently felt very strongly and expressed its views.\nMr Barrot, in his contribution, called the whole issue a huge challenge and one, I know, that all our governments are looking at. As Mr Barrot said, we have to recognise transport’s clear contribution and the need for the ‘greening’ of transport. In this respect, I am very proud of the fact that London has led the way with a number of initiatives, be it the congestion charge, the new low-emission zone or higher charges for less environmentally friendly vehicles, something which had been opposed by London’s Conservatives.\nMr Barrot also spoke about the need to recognise the external costs of transport and Mr Albertini spoke about some of the amendments. However, I think there is a contradiction in the PPE-DE Group’s position – one I know the PPE-DE Group has debated internally – and there is a contradiction in this report. Recital B, for example, talks about energy consumption and highlights ‘road transport, accounting as it does for 83% [...] of energy’. Against that, Amendment 1, by the PPE-DE Group, and co-signed by some Members from the ALDE Group, is quite clearly trying to change the position adopted in committee to one that favours road transport over rail transport. That does not fit in with a package that is arguing for sustainable transport over forms that are not friendly to the environment.\nI ask Mr Albertini, when he winds up, and I ask the ALDE Group, which has also supported this, why they are trying to turn it round and why they are trying to favour road transport. I suggest that perhaps the person whose fingerprints are really on this is not here to answer that tonight.\nI must say that my group will be considering whether we would support this whole report were that amendment to go through. I look forward to it. Other than that, the principles in the report are fine.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Evans, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Madam President, as we have heard from Mr Albertini and the Commissioner, this is a very timely and important report and we welcome it.
