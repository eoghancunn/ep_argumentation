        "1.    Notes that the 2007 Draft Estimates are proposed at EUR 1 377 700 000; this amount has been set on the basis of the 2006 financial budget increased by 4.2%; the latter amount is composed of 2% historical growth-rate and 2.2% representing an adjustment to current prices; recommends that the final level of the budget be decided at 1st reading and that it should reflect justified budgetary needs of the Institution;\n",
        "2.    Underlines that the budget should reflect actual budgetary needs and be in line with the principle of budgetary rigour and responsible use of citizen's money;the Institution should adopt a more operational approach to the Budget; stresses the need to carry out a cost-benefit analysis for the Institution to assess the implications of retaining the self-imposed ceiling of Heading 5; has decided that in the event that the ceiling of 20% is retained, the 20% should constitute the upper limit of the Budget;reserves therefore, its position on the 20% limit until the first reading;\n",
        "3.    Urges the Secretary-General that, while respecting the principle of annuality of the budget, as a measure of sound financial management, more consideration should be given to medium-term developments reflecting real operational multi-annual budgetary requirements;\n",

        "5.    Requests that the following principles of sound financial management be taken into account in the stocktaking exercise: (a)   identification of activities that have little added value, (b)   an increase in efficiency by rationalising working methods, (c)   an increased use of activity based budgeting, (d)   minimisation of costs in areas experiencing unnecessary expenditure as a result of having three different working places, (e)   re-deployment of staff, (f)     impact of the mobility policy on the effectiveness of committees and delegations and, (g)   efficient use of all resources, especially human resources;\n",
        "6.    Reiterates that appropriations should relate to specific activities thus avoiding the cancellation of appropriations at the end of the year; stresses that sufficient funding should be allocated in areas where political decisions necessitate greater financial commitment, as in the case of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, in order to avoid amending budgets and transfers) as much as possible;\n",
        "7.   Notes that further efforts should be made to complete the 2004enlargement and achieve a smooth enlargement process; asks the Secretary-General to resolve any outstanding issues pertaining to enlargement to the EU-10, especially those related to delays in the recruitment process;\n",

        "9.    Points out that the amount of EUR 48 000 000 represents approximately a 50% increase over the 2006 budget to be allocated to the enlargement process of Bulgaria and Romania assuming that the date of accession would be 1 January 2007; considers furthermore that, in the event of a postponement of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the financial impact of such postponement should be reflected in the European  Parliament budget and consequently the relevant amount of EUR 24 000 000 would be deducted from the final provision; asks the Secretary-General to deal with the budgetary consequences of the decision on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in his Letter of Amendment to be presented to the Bureau at the beginning of September 2006; Parliament - Secretariat General\n",

        "14.  Points out that over the last few years there has been a significant increase in the level of employment covering both enlargement and non-enlargement posts; maintains its opinion that the present staff complement is sufficient to cater for all the Institution’s requirements; welcomes the position taken by the Secretary-General that replacement of retired personnel would not be an automatic process and that the policy of redeployment will be implemented to fill posts that become vacant as a result of retirement;\n",
        "15.  Expresses its concern at the small number of redeployments foreseen for 2007; urges the Secretary-General to carry out a more thorough screening exercise covering all sectors of activity during the stocktaking exercise with a view to effectively ensuring the redeployment of staff in lieu of resorting to the employment of contractual agents; requests the Secretary-General to present by 1 September 2006 a report on the use of redeployment during the last three years as well as for the 2007 estimates;\n",
