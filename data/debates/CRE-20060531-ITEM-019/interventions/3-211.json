{"speaker": "Neena Gill,", "english": "Neena Gill, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work on this report. I applaud Louis Grech on the emphasis on improving the effective use of the funds. For this reason, I strongly support the introduction of activity-based budgeting. I have been asking for this system to be adopted by the Parliament for the last five years, as it provides an opportunity to demonstrate greater transparency. I have been disappointed, however, by the reluctance of the administration to introduce such a system and I think it is about time we did so. Therefore, I would ask the Secretary-General to take this issue up very seriously and see what progress we can make on that front.\nThe second issue I want to raise is the annual question of the car service. I do not go along with what is in the report, namely to increase the support of additional funds for the chauffeur service for the Members. I support the amendment that the Verts/ALE Group has put forward, which is to look at the service and see how we can improve it without increasing the funds. We do not need to start increasing funds, especially when we have taxi reimbursement available for Members.\nOn information and communication, we cannot stress enough the need for results that are essential for us to connect with the citizens. I thoroughly support the suggestions of having web TV and an improved visitors’ centre.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work on this report.
