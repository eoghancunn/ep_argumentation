{"speaker": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE),", "english": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . – Madam President, I would really much prefer that this directive was not coming before us. I would be supporting a rejection of it – not because I do not want to see soil protected, because it is in all our interests that it should be. But is the directive the right way forward?\nCommissioner Dimas, you said yourself that, at the moment, only nine Member States have legislation in place to protect soil. I would suggest that it is up to the other 18 Member States to put legislation in place to protect the soil and we should not necessarily bring forward another directive. We already have a Groundwater Directive and a Nitrates Directive. As far as agriculture is concerned, we have got a lot of cross compliance legislation that deals with the soil and soil compaction. I know the rapporteur is doing her very best to bring agriculture out of the proposal but I rather fear that what we will see is yet more bureaucracy and yet more difficulties for farmers.\nThe Commissioner also stated that there are 300 types of soil throughout the European Union. It is very difficult to have one general directive to cover all these positions. You only have to consider agriculture in a year like this, where in some Member States there have been droughts and others have had very wet weather, very heavy rainfall. If you dig potatoes in many of the northern Member States this year, where there has been lots of rain, then of course you will cause compaction. It is necessary to do that in order to get the crop. That can be rectified the following year by subsoiling and repairing the damage to the soil.\nWe need flexibility in all this. I really do think that the idea of having yet another directive in order to put more regulation upon our farmers and upon our industry is the wrong way to go.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . – Madam President, I would really much prefer that this directive was not coming before us.
