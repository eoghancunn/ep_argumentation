{"speaker": "Stavros Dimas,", "english": "Stavros Dimas, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the speakers in this debate for their positive contributions and I would like to outline the Commission’s view on a number of key issues raised by Parliament.\nLet me state that the Commission will follow the development of its proposal in the Council and in Parliament and consider its position under the light of these developments.\nI will start with those aspects of the thematic strategy which appear in the report of the Committee on the Environment and which are not covered in the directive.\nI welcome the support given in the report to tackling soil protection at a European level and the crucial links between soil protection and any strategy to combat climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification.\nI also agree on the fact of reviewing existing environmental legislation to fully exploit and further strengthen the potential synergies with soil protection.\nFinally, the resolution you have approved proposes a number of recommendations as regards a new directive on biowaste and a communication on desertification.\nThe Commission will take these recommendations into account when developing further measures implementing the thematic strategy.\nLet me now turn to the soil framework directive and outline the Commission’s current thinking regarding the issues raised.\nMany of the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment provide useful clarifications to the proposal. I am referring in particular to a better clarification of the objective of the legislation and the role played by soil functions in ensuring sustainable use of soil in Article 1, pursuant to Amendment 36. In addition, elements such as the introduction of voluntary codes of good practice or of a non-binding annex on possible measures to combat soil degradation can be supported in Articles 4 and 8, pursuant in part to Amendments 58 and 65.\nThe addition of acidification to the list of soil degradation processes that need to be tackled in order to consider the different soil conditions that apply in some new Member States. The Commission also considers the clarification introduced in the provision dealing with the identification of contaminated sites in Article 10, pursuant to Amendment 74, as an improvement to the text.\nHowever, there are also a number of amendments which raise concerns for the Commission. Firstly, Amendment 38 on Article 1, to make the soil framework directive subsidiary to other European Union legislation so that soil protection provisions contained in other Community legislation would take precedence over the provisions of this directive.\nSecondly, it is clear that there must be a date by which the programmes of measures for tackling agricultural threats should be drawn up.\nThirdly, some amendments, such as Amendment 77 concerning Article 12, eliminate the provisions concerning the information on soil contamination to be provided for certain land transactions.\nThe soil status report is a very important part of the Commission’s proposal. It will increase the level of transparency in land transactions, assist the competent authorities in identifying contaminated sites and speed up the establishment of the inventory. The costs involved in producing this report are negligible compared to the amounts of land transactions of such industrial sites.\nI would like to emphasise the importance of keeping a common list of activities in Annex 2. This annex is of fundamental importance if a meaningful, enforceable, systematic and cost-effective inventory of contaminated sites is to be achieved.\nMany Member States and regions already use a very similar list to carry out their investigations. It is very important to have a common list to ensure harmonised implementation and to avoid a distortion of the internal market for the different sectors.\nThus we will provide investors, economic operators, public authorities and society at large with legal certainty and a common ground to assess the progress in identifying contaminated sites.\nI shall provide a complete list of the Commission’s current position on the amendments to Parliament’s secretariat (1) . As I have already mentioned, I can assure you that the Commission will follow the development of its proposal in the Council and Parliament and consider its position in this light.\nOnce again I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their efforts.\nCommission’s position on amendments by Parliament\nGutiérrez-Cortines report ( A6-0410/2007 )\nThe Commission will follow the development of its proposal in the Council and in the Parliament and consider its position in the light of this development.
