{"speaker": "Jeffrey Titford (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Jeffrey Titford (IND/DEM). – Madam President, this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps. Firstly, soil contents and qualities in different parts of an individual country vary considerably. How much more variance will there be between the soils of 27 different countries with vastly differing climates? It is absurd to suggest that the EU can introduce a one-size-fits-all directive on soil from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia.\nNow a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers, many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection. They have quite rightly pointed out that they have a vested interest in protecting the soil, because it is their livelihood. They also suggest that it would place another onerous burden upon them because of the failure to give enough recognition to existing national legislation.\nThe second large credibility gap is provided by the EU’s short-sighted open border policy, which has encouraged mass immigration from Eastern Europe to my country. This has generated the need for a correspondingly huge programme of house building on every square inch of land available – some three million new homes by 2020, we are told. Even the green belt is under threat. Burying vast acreages under solid concrete is not my idea of the best way to protect soil.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jeffrey Titford (IND/DEM). – Madam President, this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps.
