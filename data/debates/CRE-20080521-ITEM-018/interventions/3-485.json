{"speaker": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the Commission communication states and I quote, ‘The concept of animal health covers not only the absence of disease in animals, but also the critical relationship between the health of animals and their welfare.’ As rapporteur for the legislation on the maximum residue level of veterinary medicines in food I would like to emphasise that the key to this critical relationship is the adequate availability of authorised veterinary medicines, particularly for what in Europe we call Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS). And the Commission needs to address this issue urgently.\nThe availability of an adequate range of veterinary medicines to treat the wide variety of animal species in the European Community has been a growing challenge over the last two decades. During this period considerable efforts have been made by various stakeholders to address the problems of medicines availability. Despite these efforts, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The lack of authorised medicines poses a real threat to animal health and welfare and the safety of consumers. It also poses significant problems for animal owners, farmers, veterinarians and governments.\nThese effects include animal health and welfare problems if animals are untreated or treated with unauthorised or an unsuitable product, and zoonotic disease implications from untreated or inappropriately treated animals for animal owners and consumers. There are also financial, legal and trade implications for the various stakeholders involved, whilst the lack of medicines may have negative effects on rural communities and agriculture generally.\nMoreover, the current availability problem in the EU not only has implications for the health and welfare of our animals, the security of the Community’s food supply, and public health, it also undermines the ability of the EU to meet the Lisbon Agenda and to reap the enormous benefits for European agriculture and aquaculture.\nI therefore call on the Commissioner to commit to incorporating an urgent review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive and address the issue of medicines’ availability in the strategy on animal health. We should not wait until emerging diseases reach a crisis state; we must amend our veterinary medicine legislation swiftly as the consequences and cost of a major outbreak of a high-impact disease in the EU would far exceed the cost of action now to develop appropriate and adequately available...\n(The President cut off the speaker.)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the Commission communication states and I quote, ‘The concept of animal health covers not only the absence of disease in animals, but also the critical relationship between the health of animals and their welfare.’ As rapporteur for the legislation on the maximum residue level of veterinary medicines in food I would like to emphasise that the key to this critical relationship is the adequate availability of authorised veterinary medicines, particularly for what in Europe we call Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS).
