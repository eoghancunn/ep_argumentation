{"speaker": "Janusz Wojciechowski,", "english": "Janusz Wojciechowski, rapporteur . ? (PL) The main idea on which the Animal Health Strategy is based is that prevention is better than cure, which is obviously the case. I am sure we all recall the problems related to BSE and avian influenza, when it proved necessary to cull millions of animals. That was a most unpleasant experience, and I am sure none of us ever wish to see it repeated. It did, however, indicate to us that we should improve cooperation at European level in order to improve protection of animal health. The latter is very closely linked to human health, owing to the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases from animals to human beings.\nI should like to single out several points in my report for particular attention. Firstly, the promotion of better standards for animal health care. The report strongly emphasises the close link between the two. It is to be hoped that both will be prominent in future policy.\nThe second issue I wish to highlight is fair competition. European producers are required to comply with a great many veterinary standards, and with provisions relating to animal health and welfare. The same requirements are not imposed on importers, however. This is emphasised very strongly in the report. Our producers and those exporting animal products to the European market should all be subject to the same requirements. This represents a major challenge to our negotiators in the framework of negotiations at the World Trade Organization.\nMy third point relates to strong support for the vaccination programme. We believe it is an important instrument with which to reduce the number of cases of disease. A new approach is required too. Products originating from vaccinated animals should not be discriminated against on the market. A number of paragraphs in the report have been devoted to this matter.\nMy fourth point concerns the damages and compensation system. Firstly, this should encourage efforts to reduce the risk of disease. Secondly, it should cover not only losses directly related to eliminating the sources of disease but also indirect losses related to market crises.\nThe fifth point is better control on the Union’s external borders. This should not be limited to controlling documents. It should involve thorough checks to effectively prevent the illegal entry of animals of unknown origin onto Union territory.\nThe sixth point relates to the time of implementation of the strategy. I believe we cannot expect to have all these legislative arrangements in place as early as 2013. A longer time period is needed.\nThe seventh point concerns financing the strategy’s aims. The draft report criticises the fact that the funding for these ambitious plans is inadequate. The plans should be properly financed from the Union’s budget.\nIn conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say a few words in English, so that I can be faithful to the quotation I shall now refer to.\n(The speaker continued in English)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Janusz Wojciechowski, rapporteur . ?
