{"speaker": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski very much for his report, and to welcome the Commissioner. I also wish to congratulate Mrs De Lange for the hard work that she has put in as shadow rapporteur. We are all very conscious that we need a very strong animal health strategy and animal welfare strategy, which is what consumers in Europe are actually demanding. However, we must also be careful that imported meat and meat products from outside the European Union also meet our high standards.\nFor instance, we would like to see a much higher welfare standard in the poultry industry. We want there to be more space for our poultry, especially broilers, and can help to produce broilers in a much more welfare-friendly manner, but at the same time we must be careful that we are not importing products of an inferior nature. Also in the case of the poultry industry, there is the banning of crates for poultry and of battery cages, and of course we also import a lot of egg products in powdered and liquid form – nearly 70% of egg products are imported in that form. Those products too can be from animals that were not kept in accordance with good animal welfare standards, so we must also be careful on that point. I also agree with my Scottish colleague that if we are to bring in traceability and look towards an electronic system, then we must ensure that system is up and running, is cost effective and can actually be properly implemented by farmers without huge costs.\nSo while I broadly accept what is a good report, I think we must be careful, as we make progress on standards in Europe, that we also have the same standards for imports.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski very much for his report, and to welcome the Commissioner.
