{"speaker": "Philip Bradbourn (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Philip Bradbourn (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the topic we are discussing today is undoubtedly one of the utmost importance to Europe and one where each Member State faces different challenges. For this very reason, whether we are dealing with illegal or legal migration, we must not go down the path of a one-size-fits-all approach. Migration matters must remain a sovereign right of each Member State.\nHowever, I am in favour of greater cooperation between Member States where common ground can be identified and where it can work for the benefit of all. And, like other speakers, I would particularly like to focus the House’s attention on the Frontex system, where we have recently released a further EUR 12 million to this organisation.\nFrom the outset the system has suffered as a result of Member States who have pledged resources but who are not honouring their commitments. If this project is going to be a success we must ensure that these promised resources are made available to the operation as and when needed.\nHowever, this is only one tool in the struggle to stop illegal immigration. We must look at new and innovative solutions at the very source where migrants start their journey. We need to look at targeted campaigns in the states of origin, making it clear that Europe is not an open door. Most of all, we must also target people traffickers.\nThe other side of this coin means our Member States having effective repatriation policies to deter those who both seek and organise illegal migration.\nSo finally can I sum up by saying that it is cooperation, not regulation, that is needed between Member States. A one-size-fits-all approach cannot solve the problems of immigration, and we must not fall into the trap of thinking that ‘more Europe’ is the solution.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bradbourn (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the topic we are discussing today is undoubtedly one of the utmost importance to Europe and one where each Member State faces different challenges.
