    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Calls on the Commission to support a suitable framework for the development of e-commerce that would boost the current low level of consumer confidence,create a more attractive business environment, improve the quality of legislation, reinforce consumer rights and the position of small business operatorson the markets, and stop the fragmentation of the internal market in the digital environment; in that respect, welcomes the communication from the Commission on the EU Consumer Policy strategy 2007-2013 - Empowering consumers, enhancing their welfare, effectively protecting them (COM(2007)0099);\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Commission, in addition to seeking to improve the quality of consumer legislation, to focus on developing appropriate rules for cross-border e‑commerce in the form of standards to which holders of the European trustmark for cross-border e-commerce would adhere voluntarily;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commissionto propose a strategy for increasing consumer confidence in the digital environment as a whole, building on experience gathered as part of the ‘e-confidence’ initiative[4];\n",
        "4.   Is convinced of the need to implement in practice and without delay the 'e-inclusion' initiative; therefore calls on the Commission to urge the Member States which are signatories to this pan-European initiative to take action to this end;\n",
        "5.  Is convinced that there should be a broader definition of ‘consumer’ better adapted to the information society;\n",
        "6.  Is convinced that small business operators deserve specific protection to enhance their position on the markets in the Information Society;\n",
        "7.  Emphasises that factors exist that give rise to a lack of consumer confidence in the digital environment, and therefore considers it necessary to pursue an active policy and to support specific mechanisms to help boost consumer confidence by ensuring that transactions in the digital environment can be safely carried out in a proper manner;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission, pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on consumer protection cooperation[5], to conclude consumer protection cooperation agreements with third countries (particularly those within the OECD), which would improve the enforceability of consumer rights in the digital environment;\n",
        "9.  Welcomes the Commission's initiative to review and update the consumer acquis, and particularly the strong focus on eCommerce;\n",
        "10. Considers that a new e-confidence strategy would contribute to raising consumer confidence, particularly by means ofprogress in the following areas:\n",
        "11. Highlights the importance of timely and effective transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive by all Member States as a key instrument guaranteeing consumer protection in cross-border transactions;\n",
        "12. Considers also that a relaunched e-confidence initiative should not only deal with consumer protection but also set out a coordinated approach to the issue of the digital environment as a whole, including analyses of non-market factors such as the protection of privacy, access by the general public to information technologies ('e-inclusion'), internet security, and so on;\n",
        "13. Insists that the European population's right to access the digital environment is paramount and recalls in this respect the importance of implementing appropriate financial and legal tools in order to promote e-inclusion, notably by enforcing and if necessary extending universal service obligations in the field of electronic communications, as well as making financial resources available for investments in the development of digital communication infrastructure;\n",
        "14. Is convinced that interested parties (representatives of the industry and of consumer organisations) must be consulted on future steps;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission to begin formulating voluntary European standards designed to facilitate cross-border e-commerce, i.e. European standards which will bridge language differences and variations between the laws in force within the various Member States - this being a factor which constitutes a serious obstacle preventing both consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses from fully exploiting the internal market's potential in the digital environment;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission to support the creation of optional standardised contracts and voluntary standardised general terms and conditions of trade for e‑commerce to guarantee a balanced relationship, in view of the fact that neither consumers nor businesses are usually legal and technical experts, but nevertheless leave the option for parties to free contracting based on the fundamental civil law principle of freedom to conclude a contract;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to establish the requirement for entrepreneurs who voluntarily use standardised contracts and standardised general commercial terms and conditions to highlight those provisions which differ therefrom;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission to propose that the rules governing electronic communications be amended to improve transparency and publication of information to end-users; European trustmark for cross-border e-commerce\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to initiate the definition of conditions and a logo for a European trustmark to guarantee greater certainty in the area of cross-border e-commerce and in this connection to ensure a general legal framework for voluntary trustmarks, as it was called on to do in the e-Commerce Directive ; recommends that this should involve:\n",
        "20. Notes, however, the following problems with implementing effective trust mark schemes:\n",
        "21. Is convinced that the most effective ways of encouraging consumer confidence are:\n",
        "22. Notes that the Universal Commercial Practices Directive covers fraudulent use of trustmarks or other marks, as well as false consumer references; asks Member States to ensure that their national consumer protection centres are alerted to such abuses;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to assess the experience already gained with existing and successful trustmarks, in particular ones operating in more than one Member State (e.g. the Euro-Label), and to make use of that experience when devising the EU trustmark for cross-border e-commerce (including verification as to whether the dissemination of trustmarks in the new Member States is hindered by a lack of adequate resources to finance the introduction of such marks);\n",
        "24. Firmly believes that trustmarks offer small and medium-sized businesses in particular a significant opportunity for building up consumer trust in the digital environment; European charter of users’ rights in the information society\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission to propose a European charter of users’ rights that would clarify the rights and obligations of information society players, including consumers, notably users’ rights relating to digital content (i.e. clarification of users’ rights and obligations when using intellectual property), users’ rights guaranteeing basic interoperability standards, and the rights of particularly vulnerable users (i.e. improving the accessibility of internet pages for disabled persons);\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to establish basic users’ freedoms and rights in the information society (in this respect, some users’ freedoms and rights should already be established within the framework of the forthcoming Communication on Content Online in the Single Market);\n",
        "27. Takes the view that the online environment and digital technology enable consumers to be offered a wide range of new products and services, and that intellectual property can be made compatible with consumers' expectations, but also considers that consumers' interests in relation to intellectual property rights are increasingly important, while their rights to enjoy digital works remain unclear and current trends in intellectual property, digital rights management and technological protection measures should adequately acknowledge consumer rights;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Commission to disseminate this charter, and to encourage the Member States and organisations concerned to disseminate it widely to all internet users, so that they know their rights and have the means to assert them;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Commission to propose measures to stop the fragmentation of the internal market in the digital environment (i.e. the refusal of access to goods, services and content offered in a cross-border context), which significantly affects consumers mainly in new and small Member States solely on the basis of their nationality, place of residence or whether they own a payment card issued in a particular Member State, and to keep Parliament regularly informed on progress made in this area;\n",
        "30. Firmly believes it is unacceptable that certain entrepreneurs who supply goods or provide services and content via the internet in several Member States deny consumers access to their websites in other Member States and force them to use their websites in the State in which they are resident or whose nationality they hold;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission to propose a provision for access to products delivered cross-border in line with Article 20 of the Services Directive;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission to closely monitor the effectiveness of Article 20 of the Services Directive, in particular with regard to objective criteria;\n",
        "33. Welcomes the fact that the Commission is investigating under which conditions the practice of territorial licensing or exclusive territorial contracts are conflicting with the Internal Market and encourages it and calls on it to comprehensively inform the Parliament about the findings of these investigations;\n",
        "34. Stresses the importance of ensuring that European entrepreneurs in the digital environment have good reason to offer goods, services and content across borders throughout the entire EU internal market;\n",
        "35. Notes that interoperability is a crucial economic factor and stresses the importance of industry-driven, accessible, interoperable standards at a technical and legal level so as to enable economies of scale, ensure non-discriminatory access to devices, services and content for consumers, promote the fast deployment of technologies and contribute to avoiding market fragmentation; stresses that true interoperability of devices, services and content at least at the consumer (end-user) level should be promoted;\n",
        "36. Is convinced that greater consumer confidence in the digital environment would be made possible by a clearer and improved consumeracquis communautairegeared towards horizontal legal instruments and the harmonisation of certain aspects of consumer contract law; this should include other directives, such as those on distance selling of financial services and e-commerce;\n",
        "37. Welcomes the suggestion made by the Commission in the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis (COM(2006)0744) to include digital files within the scope of Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees[7];\n",
        "38. Is convinced that the application of the regime on unfair contract terms should be reinforced in the field of end-user licence agreements and should include ‘technical contract terms’;\n",
        "39. Calls on the Commission to propose that the rules regulating distance contracts be extended to cover contracts concluded between consumers and professional traders in online auctions and contracts for tourist services (airline tickets, hotel accommodation, car rental, leisure time services etc.) ordered individually over the internet;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Commission to simplify and standardise the requirements for mandatory information provided by the vendor to the purchaser in e-commerce and in the context of such information to prioritise essential mandatory information;\n",
        "41. Calls on the Commission to make the supply chain in the digital environment more transparent in such a way as to ensure that the consumer always knows the identity of the supplier and whether it is an intermediary or an end supplier;\n",
        "42. Firmly believes it to be unacceptable that consumers are redirected from the vendor's website to some other website without being properly warned, since this causes the true identity of the actual supplier of the goods, services or content to be concealed from consumers;\n",
        "43. Calls on the Commission to strengthen consumer protection in cases where the consumer assumes all contractual risks, e.g. by paying in advance, particularly in electronic contracts;\n",
        "44. Calls on the Commission to speed up its consideration of action on collective redress mechanisms for cross border business-to-consumers (B2C) disputes in the digital environment;\n",
        "45. Recalling the positive experiences of SOLVIT and of the network of European Consumer Centres, calls for the creation of a European e-consumer information system which would offer all European e-consumers detailed guidance and information about consumer and business rights and obligations in the digital environment, practical orientation regarding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) opportunities, both at a general level and, where relevant, in individual cases as well;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Commission to ensure that consumers are effectively protected against security and privacy attacks in the digital environment through both regulatory and technical measures;\n",
        "47. Calls on the Commission to monitor in detail the trends in consumer protection in e-commerce by means of mobile telephones, with emphasis to be placed inter alia on the protection of young consumers;\n",
        "48. Calls on the Member States to cooperate in striving to achieve the objective of a high level of consumer protection in the digital environment throughout the entire EU internal market;\n",
        "49. Calls on the Commission to notify Parliament of the progress made as regards consumer protection in the digital environment (including practical steps taken towards fulfilment of this resolution) at regular intervals (ideally once per year); o o     o\n",
        "50. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States.\n"
