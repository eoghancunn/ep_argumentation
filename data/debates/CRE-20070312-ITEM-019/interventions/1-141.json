{"speaker": "Vladimír Špidla,", "english": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Honourable Members, thank you for the debate, which clearly demonstrates that the issue of equal opportunities remains one of the most important in the EU.\nI am delighted that virtually all of the proposals put forward are in some way contained in the roadmap for equality between men and women. I also note the fully justified comment that despite 30 years of the directive on equal pay, there is still no equal pay. This is a more complex problem than can be solved by a single directive; it is a problem involving prejudice, education and segregation in the labour market. The Commission has therefore decided to make equal pay one of its key issues. This is moreover why we have had studies carried out and have proposed communications that attempt to take effective action in this area in such a way that we can achieve tangible results. Up to now the results have not been particularly good.\nI also welcome the fact that the issue of reconciling family and work life was brought to the fore. I would point out that we have taken the first steps and it is clear that this goes beyond mere technical adjustments to the work environment; it is a broader problem that touches on the fair division of tasks in life between men and women. There remains a great deal to do in this area. I feel, for example, that the Barcelona Strategy has not been implemented as fully as had been planned.\nWhat was also highlighted was the strengthening of the proportion of women in management positions. This is a fundamental issue. The Commission was strongly criticised for the fact that there are very few women in the climate change and energy group. I should just like to point out that the current Commission has eight female Commissioners and the Commission’s Secretary-General is a woman. The female Commissioners are in charge of very important portfolios, so it is incorrect to say that no progress has been made. The situation of women in Turkey was also mentioned. I should like to highlight the fact that I am firmly committed to equal opportunities, which form part of the Copenhagen criteria, being treated with the utmost seriousness. This means that countries in which there is no equality of opportunities should not be allowed accession to the EU.\nWhen it comes to debates on cultural difference, sexual mutilations and particular cultural environments, I should like to point out that human rights and equal opportunities, in my view, take precedence over any cultural considerations. It is up to us to ensure that these rights are upheld in a sensitive manner.\nAs regards affirmative action, I feel, firstly, that this is permitted under European law, and that secondly, it is inaccurate to think of it as positive discrimination, because rather than giving preferential treatment, joint affirmative action redresses unfair burdens and balances opportunities. Quotas were mentioned a great deal and I am fully aware of the many cases in which women have been barred from a particular position simply on account of being female, having fulfilled all the other conditions. I therefore feel that the question of affirmative action is one on which we should keep a close eye and an open mind.\nHonourable Members, I should like once again to thank Mrs Sartori. After all, this own-initiative report is one that contains a wide range of important points, which we will undoubtedly make use of in our joint efforts towards guaranteeing the highest level of equality between men and women.
