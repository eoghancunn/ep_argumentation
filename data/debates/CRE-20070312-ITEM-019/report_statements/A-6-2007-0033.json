    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Takes note of the Commission’s determination to pursue the equal opportunities strategy on a multi-annual basis, as it enables the pursuit of a long-term strategy to promote equality at EU level, but points out that the Roadmap does not include a single new legislative proposal and that it fails to specify the responsibilities of the Commission and the Member States as regards implementation and information to citizens, or the funds that will be allocated to implement its recommendations;\n",
        "2.  Acknowledges the dual approach to promoting equality whereby all areas of policy should be mainstreamed at the same time as specific measures are implemented to promote equality;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission to draw up an overall framework for the assessment of policies and programmes to promote gender equality, including resulting national policies; calls in particular for an in-depth assessment of the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) (COM(2000)0335) and for an analysis of the implementation of the directives on equal opportunities, especially Directives 86/613/EEC[16], 89/391/EEC[17], 92/85/EEC[18]and 2003/41/EC[19]with a view to laying down, using reliable data and statistics, a coherent programming, implementation, monitoring, and assessment cycle for the purposes of the Roadmap; believes, with that end in view, that the European Institute for Gender Equality needs to be set up quickly so as to enable progress under the Roadmap to be constantly monitored;\n",
        "4.   Calls on the Commission to treat gender equality policy not just as a priority for the EU, but also, and above all, as an indispensable requirement of respect for the rights of the individual; considers that such an approach should translate into an effort to coordinate and strengthen European and national measures providing for the legal protection of women and children, in particular:\n",
        "5.  Calls on the Commission to work towards the adoption of a European charter of women’s rights setting out the principles regarding rights and equal opportunities deriving from the Member States’ international obligations, European legislation, and the laws of the individual Member States, and specifying the appropriate national, Community, and international institutions and bodies to which women citizens or residents of the Union could appeal if their rights were violated;\n",
        "6.  Calls on those Member States which have not yet done so to ratify, without further delay, the Protocol supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, relating to trafficking in persons (‘Palermo Protocol’) and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings and to implement Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities;[20]\n",
        "7.  Considers that the requirement to respect women’s rights, in the same way as other human rights, is central to accession negotiations with applicant countries; calls, therefore, on the Commission to monitor the statistics on the acts of discrimination and violence to which women fall victim in applicant countries, and communicate them to Parliament and the Council, and to actively encourage acceding countries to take part in the Community’s PROGRESS and DAPHNE programmes;\n",
        "8.   Stresses that respect for women’s rights must be an essential condition of the EU’s neighbourhood, foreign and development policies; in this context:\n",
        "9.  Requests that the Commission take steps to guarantee women their health rights, including sexual and reproductive health rights; reaffirms that it is essential, especially for combating HIV/AIDS, to expand access to information relating to sexual and reproductive health and to health services;\n",
        "10. Recognises that girls are particularly vulnerable to violence and discrimination, and calls for greater efforts to be made to protect girls against all forms of violence, including rape, sexual exploitation and recruitment into the armed forces, and to foster policies and programmes to promote the protection of girls’ rights in conflict and post-conflict situations;\n",
        "11. Requests the Commission to honour its undertaking to present in 2006 a communication on ‘A European Vision on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation’;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission to ensure coordination between the EU and the UN as regards equal opportunities policies and girls’ rights; reaffirms the importance of promoting close cooperation with European and international, regional and/or bilateral institutions, including United Nations bodies, in order to harmonise, as regards gender, approaches in the fields of development cooperation and humanitarian aid, especially by strengthening the link between the Peking Platform for Action and the Cairo Programme of Action, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and its optional protocol, and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs);\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission to ensure that policies on Africa and the national development strategies of African countries promote the ratification and implementation of the Maputo Protocol in all African countries, paying particular attention to Article 5, which condemns and prohibits all forms of genital mutilation;\n",
        "14. Welcomes the Commission’s commitment to promote the implementation of the abovementioned United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, and to develop guidelines in 2006 for gender mainstreaming in crisis- management training activities;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to take practical steps to promote the emancipation and economic and social integration of migrant women, including in particular, under the joint Framework for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals, measures to foster language skills and understanding of the rights and duties deriving from the Community acquis, international agreements, the principles and laws applying in host countries (which, among other things, prohibit polygamy under the cloak of family reunification) and from the Union’s core values, by drawing up specific training policies in equal opportunities, non-discrimination on grounds of gender and intervention from the gender perspective; programmes to combat discrimination in access to jobs and at work; support for immigrant women’s business projects that foster the maintenance and diffusion of the cultural wealth of their countries of origin and the creation of and support for public fora for immigrant women in which they are actively represented;\n",
        "16. Recommends that the Member States and the Commission provide for the financing of programmes aimed at giving information in the countries of origin on the prerequisites for immigrants’ arrival and stay in the EU and on the dangers associated with illegal immigration;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to launch initial gender mainstreaming pilot projects, focusing on the Union’s general budget and Community programmes, especially the Structural Funds, the seventh framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration measures (2007-2013), the Programme of Community action in the field of health and consumer protection (2007-2013), and the programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003-2008); believes that the pilot projects should address the impact of the general budget on gender equality (horizontal approach) and the effectiveness of specific contributions and reserves for women or projects proposed by women, as well as analysing the difficulties that women encounter in participating in the programmes (specific approach);\n",
        "18. Calls on the Member States to add to or strengthen their national employment and social integration plans so as to include measures to help women enter the labour market on a footing of equal dignity and equal pay for equal work and to promote female entrepreneurship, and to identify and support new work opportunities in the social and health sector and in personal and family services, in which the labour force consists mostly of women, emphasising the economic and social value of such work and providing the regulation required to guarantee the quality of the services, the recognition of the social rights and the dignity of those who deliver them, as well as helping reduce the risk of poverty; considers that due to the unfavourable position of women in the social and economic field, characterised by higher levels of unemployment and lower wages than men, women are at greater risk of exploitation and for this reason calls for the imposition of strict sanctions against exploitative employers;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Member States to implement concrete strategies to reinforce female entrepreneurship, using, for example, the opportunities offered by ICT, and measures to facilitate access for female entrepreneurs to bank loans and services, particularly with regard to microfinancing and measures in support of women’s entrepreneurial networks;\n",
        "20. Notes that the challenges faced by the Member States and the EU in the area of gender equality are increasing as a result of intensified global economic competition and the subsequent demand for an ever more flexible and mobile labour force; highlights that women continue to suffer from social, employment and other forms of discrimination and that these requirements are likely to have a stronger impact on women than on men; considers that this situation should not be permitted to undermine gender equality and women’s reproductive rights;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Member States to appoint a national official to take charge of gender equality for the purposes of implementing the Lisbon strategy (‘Ms Lisbon’), whose task should be to help draw up and revise the respective national plans and monitor their implementation so as to encourage gender mainstreaming and budgeting as regards the policies and targets laid down in the plans;\n",
        "22. Regrets the fact that the gender pay gap still amounts to 15%; calls on the Commission, as a matter of priority, to revise Council Directive 75/117/EEC,[21]especially those points relating to labour inspectorates and the legal remedies available in the event of discrimination; calls upon the Commission, too, to ensure that the directive on equal pay is applied in such a way that women do not suffer discrimination on account of their shorter experience of working life due to their bringing up children;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States and its social partners, to encourage the creation of policies to reconcile family and working life, namely by\n",
        "24. Asks the Commission to ensure that gender impact is considered properly when reviewing or developing EC legislation, such as Directive 93/104/EC, and that the Commission acts appropriately where a negative gender impact is likely, such as in the case of that directive; calls on the Council to end the opt-out from the said directive, as it is more damaging to women than to men and makes it harder to reconcile work and family life;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Commission to take into account the outcome of the Conference on Men and Gender Equality, organised by the Finnish Presidency of the Union and the role of men in the achievement of gender equality;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission, drawing on the work of the European Institute for Equality between Men and Women and proceeding from the progress monitored by the decision-making database,[23]to assess good practice at international, national, or regional level enabling women to participate in decision-making, and to encourage its dissemination and adoption, inter alia by supporting a network of women involved in the decision-making process;\n",
        "27. Urges the Member States to establish and implement clear targets and timetables for increasing women’s participation in all forms of decision-making and ensuring that they are more strongly represented in political life;\n",
        "28. Considers it important to promote participation by women in scientific and research careers; to this end, policies and instruments are required which together ensure gender balance and excellence in those professions;\n",
        "29. Considers that the presence of women in the scientific professions is encouraged not least by offering contractual solutions such as study grants or part-time work grants to help reconcile family and working life;\n",
        "30. Believes that if the media were to publicise good examples of both women’s roles in society and their achievements in all sectors, which must be highlighted in order to create positive images of women and to encourage the involvement of other women and men in achieving gender equality and a work-life balance, this would help greatly to combat the negative stereotypes which women face; calls on the Commission, therefore, to draw up measures, under the Media 2007 programme for example, to raise awareness in the media, through, for example, permanent consultation forums with members of that sector, of the stereotypes that they convey and to promote equal opportunities, particularly with a view to informing and raising awareness among young men and women;\n",
        "31. Encourages the Member States to take measures to eliminate gender stereotypes, especially on the labour market and to promote men’s presence in sectors and positions predominantly occupied by women, in primary schools and in care facilities, for example;\n",
        "32. Urges the Commission to include the rights of and problems faced by transgender persons into the Roadmap, in accordance with recent rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Communities;\n",
        "33. Calls on the Commission to set up a mandatory gender mainstreaming and gender-awareness training for Commissioners, the highest levels of civil servants, and within all management training for European civil servants;\n",
        "34. Calls on the Commission to promote the use, in all official EU documents and in interpretation into all the official languages of the European Union, of terminology that is gender-sensitive and capable of addressing all the cultures concerned;\n",
        "35. Calls on the European institutions and agencies to promote gender equality at administrative level and aim for parity between women and men in recruitments and appointments, notably for high-level positions;\n",
        "36. Calls on the Commission to devote a separate chapter of the Annual Report on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union to the Roadmap and to report in that chapter on the progress made with regard to the Roadmap;\n",
        "37. Calls on the Commission to report regularly to Parliament’s appropriate committee(s) on the monitoring of progress in connection with the Roadmap, among other things by means of public country-by-country reports;\n",
        "38. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions, and to the executive and elective bodies responsible for equal opportunities at local, regional, and national level.\n"
