        "1.  Considers that all education systems should ensure that their pupils have by the end of their secondary education the knowledge and competences they need, as defined by their respective educational authorities, to prepare them for their roles as future citizens and members of the European Union;\n",
        "2.  Stresses the importance of finding a clearer and uniform definition across the Member States of the meaning, substance and scope of the \"European dimension\";\n",
        "3.  Urges the European Council and the Ministers of Education to update the above-mentioned resolution passed on 24 May 1988, on enhancing the European dimension in education, in particular taking in to account the enlargements to the EU, which have occurred since then;\n",
        "4.  Urges the Council to recognise the two different aspects of the European dimension - firstly access to information about the EU: its institutions, methods, practices, initiatives, and secondly knowledge of Europe's shared history andcultural heritage, the development of linguistic skills, and a grasp of European current events, all of which may supplement national curricula;\n",
        "5.  Stresses the importance of using multi-media and Internet educational resources as modern teaching methods for introducing the European dimension into school curricula; with this in view, recommends for instance the setting up of a multilingual Internet service that will present best practice, provide educational assistance and serve as a platform for the exchange of experience;\n",
        "6.  Insists on the need for continued improvement in the provision of language teaching, for example within the COMENIUS section of the lifelong learning programme; recognises furthermore that it is difficult,  in some Member States, in particular for those whose mother tongue is English, to maintain sufficient interest and motivation in becoming proficient in other European languages, thus underpinning the level of mutual understanding and empathy across Europe; in this connection learning the languages of neighbouring peoples is especially important;\n",
        "7.  Urges Member States to promote the dissemination of multilingualism by a policy of learning a broader range of languages than those taught today and to establish the teaching of at least two foreign languages from a very early age in their school curricula;\n",
        "8.  Suggests an analysis of where the Lisbon Agenda has so far failed to produce the intended results in this matter and the production of a list of measures considered essential for Member State governments to implement if the agreed economic improvements are to be brought about;\n",
        "9.  Recommends an exchange of best practice between all Member States with regard to language teaching and the inclusion of European content in education, to ensure that the current initiatives, including those established pre-2004, are disseminated to all  EU Member States;\n",
        "10. Proposes that as an important aspect of ensuring the success of the last EU enlargement, adequate information, project, student and teacher exchanges should be arranged between the ten new and the fifteen more long-term Member States;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Council to consider whether useful and relevant teaching resources such as \"European School net\", learning co-operation and innovation and tools such as \"Europe at School\" require support with additional resources and whether teachers have sufficient guidance as to how to access the relevant information in order to enhance the European dimension in education;\n",
        "12. Suggests the promotion of teacher training courses which provide the trainees with the necessary understanding of European issues so that they may complement their teaching of national and local awareness with the European dimension;\n",
        "13. Stresses that the European dimension complements national content, but neither replaces nor supplants it;\n",
        "14. Stresses the need to update existing documents in particular the 1996 non-exhaustive Eurydice thematic bibliography;\n",
        "15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and Member States.\n"
