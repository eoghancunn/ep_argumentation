{"speaker": "Bernat Joan i Marí,", "english": "Bernat Joan i Marí, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, my thanks to Mr Figeľ, and to Mr Beazley for his report. The making of the European Union is a complex process in which, according to our point of view, education plays a fundamental role. It is impossible to establish European citizenship without the active support of a proper education system.\nAs we know, many of our views about history, cultures, society, etc., are forged during our crucial school years. The education system happens to be a means for a state coercion, many times at the expense of cultural plurality and diversity. For this reason, history for instance, has been traditionally very highly mediatised by the state. The consequences of state-based education can be very counterproductive for our purposes and our values. For example, chauvinism and unilingualism: nearly 50% of European citizens are only able to speak fluently their own language. We need to overcome such a state-based education. Introducing the European dimension in our education systems can be a fundamental contribution to avoiding national chauvinism, to improve citizens’ command of several languages, to strengthen respect for plurality and diversity, and to build a common European identity.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bernat Joan i Marí, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, my thanks to Mr Figeľ, and to Mr Beazley for his report.
