{"speaker": "Thomas Wise,", "english": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, may I remind you of what our rapporteur said on 12 October last year: ‘Governments know nothing about education; they frustrate the profession of teachers’. What frightens me is why he thinks the EU can do any better. Mr Beazley is a former teacher and MP and cannot be unaware that the United Kingdom Education Act 1996, brought in by his own party, forbids the promotion of partisan political views in schools in the United Kingdom.\nThe EU is a political project – a project which has failed to persuade millions of adults, as shown by the results of the French and Dutch referendums last year. Having failed at that level, Mr Beazley now wants to try persuading our children of the benefits of the EU instead. I am reminded of a quotation: ‘Give me a child at the age of seven, and he is mine for life’.\nThis, like so much else from this Committee, is sheer one-sided propaganda, and I will not tolerate or support it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Thomas Wise, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, may I remind you of what our rapporteur said on 12 October last year: ‘Governments know nothing about education; they frustrate the profession of teachers’.
