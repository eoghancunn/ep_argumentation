{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . Mr President, once again, this is a very timely initiative, as we are preparing for the launch of new seven-year programmes. In future this particular dimension could be much more evident in cooperation on education and training policies than previously. This report could also be inspirational, therefore, for the Council and the Member States. That falls within their competence and responsibility, of course, but we should at least reflect on where we are and what can be done to improve this educational dimension.\nIn his report, Mr Beazley touches on serious and specific problems. The Commission shares those concerns. In the last joint report by the Council and the Commission on progress in the Education and Training 2010 programme, we concluded, for example, that ‘despite some promising initiatives on mobility and participation in EU programmes, there is still a lack of national strategies on the European dimension in education’.\nPolicies that would ensure that, after initial education, young people have the knowledge and competences they need as European citizens – not only as tourists but as citizens – are piecemeal and fragmented. It is also true that the term ‘European dimension’ has a different meaning. On the one hand, it refers to the concept of Europe, its civilisation, democratic values and projects. However, it can also be seen as European citizenship or European identity, with rights and duties as citizens, active participation and a sense of belonging to Europe. It is thus important to have clear views on how to integrate the European dimension in school curricula and how to provide schools with both the material and the opportunities to learn about Europe in practice.\nThe Commission has already started this work. Among our programmes, Comenius, for example, supports projects with partners from different countries working on developing the European dimension. The ‘European SchoolNet’ is a good example of an interactive and virtual tool for networking and for dissemination. The Youth Programme also aims to familiarise young people with the concept of a European dimension in their lives through exchanges and especially through voluntary service. Transnational projects like these are an excellent example of the European dimension in practice.\nThe recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning, which we have just discussed, is an important step forward. It highlights a number of skills and attitudes needed for active European citizenship as part of social, civic and cultural competences. Similarly, our work with national experts on teacher training stresses the importance of European knowledge, mobility and networking. These are a very important part of teachers’ professional development. I fully agree with Mr Beazley.\nThe Commission shares the view that much more needs to be done to raise awareness of the many good national and European initiatives. The Commission continues to work with Member States, for example co-financing projects within Comenius and supporting multilingualism, and we will encourage Member States to develop the European dimension as part of their lifelong learning strategies.\nMoreover, my colleague Mrs Wallström and I recently agreed on a number of initiatives to be taken in this area. Therefore, for all these reasons, I see this report as providing major input into the Commission’s reflections on the issues of education and citizenship.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission .
