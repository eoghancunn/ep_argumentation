{"speaker": "Godfrey Bloom,", "english": "Godfrey Bloom, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, Mr Toubon concedes that ‘the citizens of all Member States are having their doubts about the internal market and the other common policies’. He allows that the EU has not succeeded in overcoming a crisis of confidence. Then he refers to the very document – now known as the ‘Reform Treaty’ – which has precipitated this crisis, by saying patronisingly that involving national parliaments will help them better understand the advantages of a single market.\nThese poor benighted parliaments, by the way, are only the democratically elected sovereign legislators of 27 European nations, unlike this absurd consultative assembly which does not and cannot represent anyone but the Commission and its associated elites. With that, this report launches into a plan to undermine national responsibility for universal services by changing the definition of universal services and including health services, to take control of intellectual property rights, which we all know will include patents on software, to adjust business taxation without representation, to set up a sort of King Canute’s throne on an isotherm in order to grab power and money through carbon trading. As for small companies, we all know that the EU, its economic partners and the World Trade Organisation will continue to crush them. Mr Toubon, a crisis of confidence?
