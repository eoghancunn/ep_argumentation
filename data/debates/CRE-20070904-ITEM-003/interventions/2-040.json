There are deficiencies with respect to all four freedoms. Also, we are seeing crumbling stakeholder confidence in the achievements of the single market. These are largely taken for granted.\nAs regards movement of goods, 25% are still subject to various national technical barriers. Hopefully the Commission’s policy package from January 2007 will swiftly be translated in targeted measures for resolving the remaining obstacles.\nAs regards people, uncertainty persists over some basic principles, notably in the transferability of social rights. I am happy that this political minefield is being gradually negotiated in the field of, for instance, pensions and access to cross-border healthcare.\nAs for capital and services, big changes are afoot. The status quo, for example as regards the lack of a common corporate tax base, distorts investment decisions in the single market and disadvantages SMEs.\nEven as the EU rolls up its sleeves for future challenges by way of the Reform Treaty, a political impetus for completing the single market is needed.
