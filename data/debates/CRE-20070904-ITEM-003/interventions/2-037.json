The single market is not a means to an end. Our policies must serve the people and improve their quality of life. All Europeans, you and I, should be able to identify with these policies.\nBig challenges remain in the single market. Some of our proposals are already on the table. Others will soon come. We need your support on these initiatives to bring them to a successful end. We are rethinking the way we govern the single market, at national and EU level. Any initiative is thoroughly prepared under the better regulation principles. This allows us to examine all options before taking action and this may include considering self-regulation in specific areas.\nWe need to improve the ownership of the single market. It belongs to our consumers, to our companies, to our workers and our civil society. It belongs to national, regional and local authorities. We need to facilitate the cooperation between Member States on a daily basis.\nI would like once again to thank the rapporteur and am looking forward to receiving further comments from Parliament in the coming months.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened carefully to the discussion on the future of the single market and I would like to thank all participants for their comments.\nThe review of the single market is an essential part of a reference to the delivery of a Europe of tangible results with the clear focus on the citizens.
