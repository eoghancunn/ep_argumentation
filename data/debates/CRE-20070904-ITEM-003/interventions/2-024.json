{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three points. The first is a word of thanks to Mr Toubon and the way in which he has directed the whole process. I think everyone on the right and the left of the House has actually been quite pleased with the way in which things have gone. I think that the report is very good and balanced.\nMy second point is about selling the internal market. I think that this paper tries to sell the internal market and we really need to do it. Mr Goebbels, you referred earlier to the so-called 'Nordic model'. Well, let me tell you that the Nordic model yes, on the one hand is about social welfare, but on the other hand it is also about economic openness. These are the countries that are completely abiding by the rules of the single market – free movement of goods, free movement of services - with Polish plumbers! - free movement of money and free movement of people, with people coming in from other countries to work, so these are also open economies at the same time. My argument is that we should not put down the single market because it is probably the best thing that we in the European Union have ever done.\nFinally, I want to give you an example of how the single market does not work. This is a real life example. A Finnish Finnair captain bought a car in Italy, I shall not mention what kind of car, at the beginning of the summer. Half an hour after he drove out of the shop he was stopped by the police. They took away his interim licence plates which were legal, bought in Germany, and they confiscated the car and they will not give it back until they have gone through a legal process in December. It could very well be that he loses his car, and here we are talking about an internal market where there should be full and free movement of goods. So my point is that this report is great and it shows that we really have to keep on improving and working with the single market with a nice balance of free competition and social welfare.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three points.
