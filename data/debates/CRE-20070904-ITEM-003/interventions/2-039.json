It is therefore the occasion for our Parliament to stress the benefits consequent to a genuinely completed single market.

In order to achieve effective completion of the single market rules, the Union must give itself the necessary enforcement tools for encouraging cooperation between national administrations, setting up information contact points for businesses and citizens, improving the efficiency of the complaints procedure, and undertaking actions through the relevant courts when necessary.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – This own-initiative report is an excellent opportunity to feed into the current review of the single market.
