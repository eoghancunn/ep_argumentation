{"speaker": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE). –", "english": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE). – Mr President, as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon, particularly on the way he has worked to achieve a consensus among all the groups for a set of recommendations on the review of the internal market, which I trust the Commission will take on board as well as today’s debate.\nI want to stress some of the proposals which I believe are key in engaging citizens in the progress and development of the internal market and in boosting confidence in particular. More involvement of national parliaments to better reflect the diverse views of Member States and their citizens is a very important proposal. Equally important is the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions of the internal market, and of course the internal market needs to continue to deliver more choice, better quality and competitive prices for our consumers and small businesses.\nReducing administrative burdens and boosting innovation, while protecting our intellectual property, will enable us to compete in the global arena. Consumer confidence in the internal market can only work when citizens are able to see the benefits and enjoy the rights and opportunities they have as members of the EU. Therefore, I hope that we will go beyond simply protecting our consumers to making sure we have remedies for them when things go wrong.\nIn that regard, I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SOLVIT network and the European consumer centres. These informal, practical networks provide quick solutions to very complex problems in what is perceived by our citizens as a bureaucratic environment. One of the reasons why they do not want to shop across the border is because they do not trust that they will have a remedy when something goes wrong. The Commission should therefore strengthen these networks as an essential element of the review process. I think, Commissioner, we share the same objectives: to achieve an internal market that is relevant and responsive to all – you said that in your introductory comments – and I think that we want now to work together with you to ensure that our citizens continue to achieve the level of access to the internal market, the benefits and indeed the protection with remedies and redress.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Arlene McCarthy (PSE). – Mr President, as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon, particularly on the way he has worked to achieve a consensus among all the groups for a set of recommendations on the review of the internal market, which I trust the Commission will take on board as well as today’s debate.\nI want to stress some of the proposals which I believe are key in engaging citizens in the progress and development of the internal market and in boosting confidence in particular.
