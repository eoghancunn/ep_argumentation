{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . Mr President, honourable Members, once again your contributions here today demonstrate the commitment of Parliament to maritime policy and this is clear proof of the excellent coordination work carried out by Mr Piecyk.\nIn your contributions, you raised a number of points which clearly merit further study and consideration, especially in view of the preparation for the adoption of the Blue Paper by the Commission next October.\nLet me state clearly that the aim of our work on maritime policy is to unlock the potential that exists in the sustainable use of our oceans and seas. We are looking for the first time at this maritime space in an integrated and holistic manner and we seek to build on where we see the added value. Let me underline that this is certainly not an exercise in centralisation of powers but one which seeks to provide an incentive for coordination and to involve stakeholders much more than they are involved today.\nClearly, this is the beginning of the process and not the end. There will be opportunities to continue to develop our positions on a number of points raised. Let me just repeat that a maritime policy cannot be a one-size-fits-all policy. The specificities of the different seas around the European Union have to be properly factored in.\nLet me just say a word on the regional aspects. Clearly, we view the regional dimension as the key factor in our exercise and the ultra-peripheral dimension is undoubtedly focal. I would like to assure you that those involved on a regional level and regional actions will remain a cornerstone of our policy as we bring this issue forward.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission .
