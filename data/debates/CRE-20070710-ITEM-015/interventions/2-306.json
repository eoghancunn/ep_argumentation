{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . Madam President, honourable Members, when we began this process the words ‘towards a maritime policy for the European Union’ made up a phrase full of potential and promise.\nToday, two years after our work started and one year since the launch of the Green Paper, we are no longer only talking of what is possible. We are talking of what can become a reality. On 30 June we ended the consultation process. Thousands of stakeholders throughout Europe have taken an active part in the process expressing overwhelming support for this project. Parliament has been very active in the run-up to this debate. Let me express my thanks and appreciation at the outset to the rapporteur, Willi Piecyk, for having coordinated the keen interest of the various committees and having produced this impressive report. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs of the various active committees for their invaluable input as well as the other MEPs who were particularly supportive of the maritime policy project. We are especially happy with the holistic cross-sectoral nature of the opinion of Parliament. The common understanding reflected in the report is a good basis for the future functioning of a holistic and integrated maritime policy for Europe.\nThe contents of the report are indeed impressively vast and we are grateful for such a substantial number of suggestions. We welcome the fact that Parliament points out that in the area of maritime affairs, speedy progress must be made on the legislative proposals which are now before the Council and which relate both to the safety of maritime transport and to the protection and preservation of the marine environment. The goals of our future maritime policy will indeed need to see a proper implementation of this legislation by Member States.\nIn the 2008 preliminary draft budget the Commission has also asked for credits to undertake preparatory actions which aim to start implementing of some actions foreseen under the new maritime policy and we hope that Parliament will support these requests.\nWe are prepared in particular to work in areas such as the integration of surveillance systems for activities on the sea, the setting-up of a network on data relating to the seas and oceans and on the exchange of best practices in maritime industries and services through the promotion of maritime clusters in 2008. We are convinced that such projects will yield substantial benefits in the long run.\nTurning to some specific elements raised in the report, let me make some general comments. The Commission welcomes the call by Parliament to ensure that the environmental dimension is clearly reflected in the proposals we will be making in October and is committed to paying particular attention to climate change. In this regard the Commission is analysing the contributions of all stakeholders which deal with emissions trading and shipping, renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar power for ships, land-based power supply for ships in ports, offshore wind energy, ship dismantling and others. All these will have a positive contribution to make with respect to climate change and broader environmental considerations.\nAs has been said on many occasions, the marine environmental protection strategy remains at the core of the maritime policy and constitutes its environmental pillar. They will mutually reinforce one another.\nThe Commission also welcomes the recognition underlined in the report of the importance of maritime transport to the European economy. Efforts at simplification and better regulation remain a top priority for the Commission. Maritime transport presents one of the least environmentally damaging modes of transport. Bearing this in mind, efforts should be stepped up to improve the track record even further.\nMaritime transport is also important beyond reasons of sustainability as it contributes to further the integration of our common internal market and is crucial for Europe’s external trade in this era of globalisation.\nThe economic importance of the maritime sectors for the European Union and the success of a number of national and regional clusters are well known. The concertation on EU maritime policy has demonstrated a keen interest of all those involved to strengthen and encourage the development of maritime clusters across the European Union. The Commission has committed itself to promoting best practice and interlinkages for maritime clusters in both national and regional contexts through mapping Europe’s maritime clusters and analysing their potential cooperation.\nWith respect to the points raised in the report on research and innovation, the Commission believes that excellence in maritime research and technology is essential to develop the vast potential of sea resources in a sustainable manner. It will constitute a fundamental basis to achieve integration and to enhance synergies in the different maritime sectors. This is why marine research and technology was recognised as a cross-cutting priority in the Seventh Research Framework Programme that will be addressed with particular attention.\nWe recognise the importance of tourism as a driver for sustainable growth in coastal and maritime areas. At the same time, coastal and maritime tourism can be used as a tool to foster the preservation of cultural, historical and environmental features of our maritime space.\nA communication is planned for 2007 and it will set out an agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism. It will be based on the report that collected the reactions of all European tourist stakeholders and will point to possible new initiatives at EU level, including on coastal and maritime tourism, which could usefully complement Member States’ initiatives.\nThe Commission welcomes the positive attitude of the report towards the need to ensure sustainability in the field of fisheries. We have taken a number of initiatives in order to increase the number of marine protected areas and to develop policies in favour of longer-term approaches to fisheries management.\nIn addition, the Commission has already made proposals for the progressive elimination of discards. Within the context of the October package, the Commission will also adopt proposals aimed at combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries and measures on destructive fishing practices.\nTurning now to social aspects, let me say that we fully share the concerns of Parliament regarding the scarcity of experts and well-trained professionals facing the maritime industry and will look with great interest at the suggestions made in the report for specialised training courses aimed at providing a broad understanding of the ecosystem-based approach to sea and oceans management.\nWe also share Parliament’s opinion that the exclusion of seafarers from social directives should be reviewed. With regard to social rules for seafarers, let me underline the importance of the ongoing work between the social partners on integrating the consolidated ILO Convention on Working Conditions for Seafarers into Community law.\nOne final point concerning governance: it is clear from our consultations with Member States and stakeholders that closer coordination between all sectoral policies and all levels of governance is required if we are to make a success of maritime policy. I therefore find the position of Parliament on this issue both timely and relevant. In addition, we recognise that the exchange and stimulation of best practice in integrated maritime policy making needs to be backed by platforms that support the exchange of experience and information on best practice. To this end, we intend to organise annual conferences which will bring together relevant actors from regions, Member States and at EU level, including stakeholders in all relevant areas. This exercise will also contribute to raising the visibility of the maritime sectors in general.\nHonourable Members, in order to build on the momentum gained during the consultation process, we aim to put forward an ambitious maritime policy package on 10 October and present it for further consultation with Parliament and the Council. The package will translate the vision of a new EU maritime policy into reality. It will include a communication on the consultation process that will show how broad and extensive it has been and that will highlight the close and constructive engagement we have had with our interlocutors, and a second communication that will propose a European maritime policy and action plan. The policy will focus on Europe’s maritime reality, on the importance of an integrated approach to maritime affairs and on our vision for the policy and its principles. It will aim to promote and develop the sustainable use of the oceans and seas, delivering a high quality of life across the regions, providing transparency and raising the visibility of maritime Europe, strengthening Europe’s maritime international leadership role and, last but not least, reaching for Europe’s full knowledge and innovation potential in maritime affairs. The action plan will indicate our intention as regards how to implement a maritime policy through the identification of the actions and the subjects for a proposal.\nIn conclusion, may I once again congratulate Parliament and the rapporteurs concerned for their excellent work. We look forward to continuing our close dialogue with you in the months ahead in the interest of laying the foundations for a more integrated European maritime policy for Europe.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission .
