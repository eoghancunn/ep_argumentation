{"speaker": "Richard Howitt (PSE). –", "english": "Richard Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper and today make the case for my own region, the East of England, to host the proposed European Centre of Excellence in the UK. With 700 km of low-lying coastline, major ports at Great Yarmouth, Ipswich, Felixstowe, Harwich and Tilbury, areas of outstanding natural beauty in north Norfolk and on the Stour and Orwell estuaries, for us it is a practical, not a theoretical, ambition to create a better relationship between people and the sea.\nWe need to build on the EU-funded centre promoting renewable energy in Lowestoft – due to open this year – where my region’s potential for offshore wind development could meet 25% of the United Kingdom’s electricity needs and make a major contribution towards European targets to cut carbon emissions. We need to recognise that rising sea levels – 40 cm by 2050 in the East of England – mean that current plans for coastline protection against erosion and flooding are no more than a sticking plaster for our region and for Europe. Devastating floods across East Anglia in 1953 killed 307 people, and today nearly half a million properties are at risk. We have to do more.\nFinally, the maritime strategy must support economic development in maritime regions. We suffer from peripherality. In my region, King’s Lynn, Clacton-on-Sea, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock are amongst the top 10% in terms of multiple deprivation in the UK. In port development, tourism and regeneration, we have to make the concept of sustainable development a reality.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper and today make the case for my own region, the East of England, to host the proposed European Centre of Excellence in the UK.
