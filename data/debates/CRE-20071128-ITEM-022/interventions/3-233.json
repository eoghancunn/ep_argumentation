{"speaker": "Robert Evans (PSE). –", "english": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, who is chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and who began by pointing out that the Treaties allow policies that impact on tourism. It is therefore very appropriate that we are considering this issue. Equally, as Mr Arnaoutakis reminded us a few moments ago, at least 12% of jobs in the EU depend on tourism.\nThe EU is much more, nowadays, than just a common market for goods and capital. It is a common market for people. EU citizens, as we know, are travelling more than ever, not least as tourists. Many, perhaps most, have very good experiences, but it is the minority – the few who have less happy experiences – that give some aspects of the tourism industry a poor name.\nI draw colleagues’ attention in particular to paragraphs 24 and 25, which call for a set of comprehensive guidelines for hotels that are sensitive to the needs of consumers. Those guidelines should take into account the demands of families with children. Not all hotels may be able to respond to these, but the industry really needs to make itself as family-friendly as possible.\nEqually, a system of classification must take into account the needs of the elderly and the disabled. The Transport Committee has argued for this in the case of airlines, and it is right to require that hotels, too, should not discriminate against this social group. Nor should they be able to make moral judgments on who qualifies as a couple, and who does not.\nThe report is also right to point out, as it does in paragraph 48, which suggests a charter of rights and obligations for tourists, that tourists should themselves behave properly and respect hotels and the tourism business.\nThis is a good report, it is a ‘good news’ story and it sends a message that Parliament is acting sensibly in the interests of the consumers. I hope that message reaches the people of Europe.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Evans (PSE). – Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Costa, who is chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and who began by pointing out that the Treaties allow policies that impact on tourism.
