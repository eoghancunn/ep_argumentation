        "1.        Stresses the importance to Europe of tourism, including tourism from third countries;\n",
        "2.        Highlights in particular the need to simplify visa application procedures on a reciprocal basis and to reduce the costs of tourist visas for entry into any Member State;\n",
        "3.        Highlights the possibility for concerned Member States to use Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention[2]as a new tool for facilitating tourism from bordering third countries;\n",
        "4.        Calls on the Member states that are party to the Schengen agreement to establish common consular desks for the grant of visas to non-EU applicants, to ensure that these desks have the same working methods and apply the same visa criteria and to improve the  reception given to visa applicants through, for example, the management of appointments, the way in which interviews are carried out and the time limit for processing applications, since this would lead to significant budgetary savings for the Member States;\n",
        "5.        Stresses the need to review, in the Community Code on Visas, the number and type of documents that are requested from visa applicants;\n",
        "6.        Strongly recommends that there should be a presumption in all EU visa policies in favour of issuing multiple-entry visas;\n",
        "7.        Points out that longer-term visas of at least one year's validity are needed by tour operators and transport companies so that they can hire the right personnel to meet the needs of their clients; insists on the need to maintain and enhance the delivery of visas for groups;\n",
        "8.        Calls on the Schengen Member States to simplify Schengen visa application procedures for tourists who have already been issued with visas for non-Schengen EU countries or have already arrived in these countries, and calls on the non-Schengen EU countries to do the same for holders of Schengen visas;\n",
        "9.        Recognises, however, that the simplification and harmonisation of visa application procedures and the  general facilitation of access to Europe for tourists from third countries have to be compatible with the security rules required in order to combat illegal immigration, terrorism, and organised crime, especially cross-border crime;\n",
        "10.      Recalls that there is an absolute need for adequate, trustworthy, homogeneous and up-to-date information on tourism so that key strategic and management decisions can be taken in the public and private sector, and a need to develop adequate accompanying measures and orientations at EU level, in order to ensure that Europe remains the first destination in international terms and becomes competitive once again;\n",
        "11.      Calls for a review of Council Directive 95/57/EC of 23 November 1995 on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism[3]1so as to ensure better harmonisation of data collection by Member States, in relation to both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the supply of data.\n",
        "12.      Welcomes the initiative to modernise the framework through a new Regulation to be implemented uniformly across the EU; points out that this reform should be carried out swiftly;\n",
        "13.      Calls on the Commission to seek possibilities for implementing  in the Member States Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSAs) since such measurements allow tourism to be accurately compared with other economic sectors and can contribute to a better understanding of the true size and value of the tourism industry;\n",
        "14.      Emphasises the need to increase awareness of the importance of tourism to economies and regional development; calls on the Member States to fully adopt TSAs and to update statistics on a yearly basis so as to ensure that timely and adequate data are available to support the complete and sound integration of tourism into economic and employment policies;\n",
        "15.      Urges the Commission to examine the need to collect statistical information and quality data in order to allow for an assessment of the impact of tourism on the economy, the environment and the quality of life of the inhabitants of popular tourist destinations;\n",
        "16.      Calls on the Commission to publish a report on the various national schemes in place for the protection of special natural and historic sites by means of specific town planning and building regulations and, where appropriate, to encourage best practice in these areas through  the publication of guidelines;\n",
        "17.      Calls on the Commission to draw up a harmonised scoreboard describing  the condition of natural and historic sites, and in particular the impact of tourists on these sites, with a view to regulating the number of visits and ensuring that they are properly conserved and passed on to future generations;\n",
        "18.      Notes the multiplicity of classification schemes in the Member States and considers that this situation, from the point of view of the consumer,  has a negative impact on the industry's reliability and on transparency;\n",
        "19.      Notes that consumers regard the system of classification as an important instrument for choosing a hotel or other accommodation: it is therefore important that accurate information on the meaning of the classification in the different countries be easily available to consumers and that it take their needs into close consideration;\n",
        "20.      Considers it advisable and possible to establish a common ground and common criteria for customers in order that they be able to make a choice, on the basis of clear and verifiable classification criteria, when they decide to travel abroad,;\n",
        "21.      Notes, in this respect, that, given the great number of criteria in certain national and regional systems, the simplification of current standards would achieve the aim of clarifying and facilitating information for the consumer  and would also ensure  better levels of transparency with regard to tourist accommodation;\n",
        "22.      Calls on the European hospitality industry to:\n",
        "23.      Calls on local, regional and national authorities, whenever making a contribution to  systems of classification, to support, within the framework of proper public/private partnerships, the current work of the European hospitality industry in relation to both the transparency and approximation, via benchmarking, of the existing classification systems;\n",
        "24.      Is aware that a common classification system at EU level would be very difficult to achieve given the variety of hotel types and tourist accommodation due to local requirements, cultures and sensitivities, and in view of the very different structures of current classification plans;\n",
        "25.      Considers, however, that a set of guidelines based on common and uniform criteria for the entire EU could take into account the interests of the consumer, while respecting the environment and local characteristics;\n",
        "26.      Calls on the Commission,in cooperation with  European hotel and cateringorganisations,such asHOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants and Cafés in Europe), and with theEuropean consumer protection organisations,to establish a methodology for creating such minimum standards on safety and quality of accommodation services; stresses that such a methodology could include the introduction of an EC mark for accommodation that would encompass pan-European common criteria providing consumers with an assurance as to the minimum level of quality to be expected whatever EU country is visited;\n",
        "27.      Calls on the European hospitality industry to pursue its work in relation to the setting up of a European “umbrella” for quality management schemes and to inform regularly the Community institutions of progress made;\n",
        "28.      Encourages stakeholders from the European hospitality industry to further develop European standards with the aim of, inter alia, facilitating the transmission of information to the recipients and improving the quality of service provision; and calls on the Commission and the Member States to support their efforts where necessary;\n",
        "29.      Calls on local, regional and national authorities, whenever involved in quality schemes, to support, within the framework of proper public/private partnerships, the current work of the European hospitality industry in relation to a European “umbrella” for quality management schemes;\n",
        "30.      Welcomes the fact that environmental protection labels are on the increase, but considers that the multiplication of labels at local level can cause confusion for tourists and affect transparency, prompting the need for better information for tourists and a consolidation of current labels for better international recognition;\n",
        "31.      Notes with satisfaction that labels relating to environmental protection are increasing in number;\n",
        "32.      Calls on the Commission, in cooperation with HOTREC as the European catering trade association, to promote labelling processes regarding tourist accomodation undertaken in the different Member States and to promote quality models that have proved effective elsewhere (for example the Qualmark in New Zealand) in order to improve visibility;\n",
        "33.      Calls on the Commission, the Member States and stakeholders to contribute to the enhancement of a sustainable labelling process based on environmental and social criteria by showcasing best practice, transfer of best practice and encouraging initiatives by industry leaders;\n",
        "34.      Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the use of eco-labels for tourist facilities, sites and services;\n",
        "35.      Is aware of the fact that more and more tourists are booking their travel (transport, accommodation, etc.) directly using electronic means and avoiding intermediates- tour operators and travel agents- whose market share is diminishing (from 98% in 1997 to 60% in 2007) but who are still subject to legal regimes, such as Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours[4]; stresses that this anomaly needs to be rectified by incorporating into Directive 90/314/EEC all websites that offer more than one service for sale, such as those offered by low-fare airlines and other actors in this market;\n",
        "36.To this end Parliament welcomes the recent consultation paper of the Commission of 26 July 2007 on the review of Directive 90/314/EEC which addresses the issues relating to the different regulatory regimes applicable to traditional tour operators and providers of dynamic packages over the Internet;\n",
        "37.      Stresses the increasing role of new technology in the tourist industry, particularly for the marketing of tourist products as well as for the enhancement of cultural goods and events;\n",
        "38.      Considers that this fast development of the use of IT technologies for tourist services requires a consumers and personal data protection framework for electronic bookings, which might be based on a prior analysis of this market by the Commission; believes that such a framework should ensure that online consumer rights and personal data are protected and that consumers receive information that is true, not deceptive, up-to-date and unambiguous; therefore recommends, in the interests of consumer protection, the certification of sites that provide information and offer tourist services (reservation and payment) of an electronic nature;\n",
        "39.      Stresses the positive role played in this area by organisations working in the field of social tourism, whose activities should be encouraged and supported;\n",
        "40.Welcomes the Commission proposal of 7 June 2007 for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of consumers in respect of certain aspects of timeshare, long-term holiday products, resale and exchange (COM(2007)0303), aimed at extending the scope of the existing regulatory framework so as to include new long-term holiday products that have emerged on the market over the last years and certain transactions, such as resale and exchange, related to timeshare; considers that the proposal will enhance consumer protection in the tourism sector and create a level playing field protecting the honest timeshare industry from unfair competition;\n",
        "41.      Regrets the absence of a specific legal instrument covering the safety of services, which is crucial in the tourism sector and calls on the Commission and on the Member States to evaluate the possibility of  tackling  this issue in order to address the concerns expressed by several Members of Parliament.\n",
        "42.      Calls on the Commission to conduct a European promotional campaign on road safety, drawing attention to new common control measures, in order to inform tourists of the various regulations that apply in Member States other than their own country of residence;\n",
        "43.      Calls on the Commission to simplify procedures for hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) and to take account of the needs of small businesses, with particular regard to micro-businesses;\n",
        "44.      Stresses the importance of using all available Community programmes, including the Second Programme of Community Action in the Field of Health, in order to promote health-related tourism;\n",
        "45.      Stresses that businesses in the insurance sector must play a greater role in supporting health-related tourism; in addition, emphasises that businesses in the insurance sector should be given support in relation to finding solutions for trans-boundary cooperation to finance health-related tourism.\n",
        "46.      Considers, in view of the decline in health tourism, that there is a need for the adoption of a specific Community directive to define the recognition and use of hydro-thermal resorts and, more generally, the role of health tourism and thermal cures in connection with tourist facilities in the various Member States – apart from the health, social security and insurance aspects – by also making available sufficient financial resources to enable a strategically important sector of the Member States’ economy to embark on a suitable development process, so as to significantly  increase new direct and indirect employment;\n",
        "47.      Welcomes initiatives to coordinate at European level the information on accessible tourism that would allow tourists with reduced mobility and their families to find information about the accessibility of tourist destinations; calls on all Member States, tourism providers and national and local tourist organisations to join and/or to support this kind of initiative;\n",
        "48.      At the same time, calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider the feasibility of drawing up a charter of the rights and obligations of European tourists, in view of the riotous and violent incidents caused  by European tourists in  European tourist destinations , and also a European code of conduct for tourist businesses;\n",
        "49.      Calls on the Commission and the Member States to initialise an \"Access for all \" EC label that would guarantee core accessibility facilities for tourists with reduced mobility and would cover offers such as accommodation, restaurants, leisure and natural sites, auditoriums, monuments, museums, etc.;\n",
        "50.      Stresses, furthermore, the need to protect, conserve and restore the European cultural heritage; and calls for more stringent management of such sites and of the conditions under which they are visited, and for greater efforts to improve access for people with disabilities, growing numbers of whom now travel for leisure purposes;\n",
        "51.      Calls on the Commission to draft a Communication with an action plan on the enhancement of such a label based on the work it has already carried out , on experiences and best practices at national and local level and taking stock of what has been achieved at EU level in the transport field;\n",
        "52.      Notes that the accessibility of tourist destinations is a matter that also has to do with the transport services provided or available; calls, therefore, on the Commission, for the purposes of the new European tourism policy and of developing European transport policy, to take due account of the accessibility handicap affecting regions with specific natural or geographical characteristics, such as the outermost regions, island and mountain regions, and the sparsely populated northernmost regions;\n",
        "53.      Points to the need for the new tourism policy to make European tourism sustainable in economic, social, territorial, environmental, and cultural terms; accordingly endorses the specific steps to be taken by the Commission to promote the economic and social sustainability of European tourism; and applauds the Commission for taking the initiative of drawing up an Agenda 21 for European tourism; further looks forward to the submission of the proposal in question, which is due to occur this year;\n",
        "54.      Welcomes the fact that the Commission, in its abovementioned communication, expressly calls for the promotion of sustainability in tourism, and stresses that social, economic and environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the development and maintenance of any tourist activity;\n",
        "55.      Insists on the need to support and promote more sustainable and socially responsible practices in the tourist industry and to evaluate their effectiveness, so that the industry receives greater prominence in the renewed Lisbon Strategy;\n",
        "56.      Welcomes the Commission’s initiative in proposing a European Agenda 21 for Tourism as a basis for tourism policy; calls on the Commission to provide the Member States with a guide making it possible to improve political coordination in the development of tourism at national, regional and local levels and enhance the sustainability of tourist activities;\n",
        "57.      Emphasises that threats to the environment, especially carbon dioxide emissions, require the tourism industry to be involved in the education of tourists regarding environmental issues when drawing up environmental policy;\n",
        "58.      Considers that tourism is partly responsible for theharm caused to the environment, which is related to the increasing amount of journeys made, representatives in the field of tourism should involve themselves in activities which concern issues pertaining to environmental protection and their planning;\n",
        "59.      Considers that a substantial set of rules exists at EU level for passenger rights in the field  of air transport which promote accessibility and  offer fair compensation in the event of a delay and cancellation but also in the event of an accident;\n",
        "60.      Stresses the point that Parliament is currently  endeavouring to  ensure that substantial supplementary provisions are drawn up in order to consolidate such rights for rail and ship passengers so as to guarantee a harmonised scheme at EU level;\n",
        "61.      Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the provision of information to passengers, and, in particular, the proper implementation of those passenger rights, and particularly of  air passenger rights, and to ensure that easily accessible arbitration mechanisms are provided for by the Member States in situations where a defaulting operator fails to pay damages;\n",
        "62.      Calls on the Commission to reflect on an approach through which the EU could offer protection to passengers that have been left behind by a defaulting charter operator, intermediates or scheduled carriers as a result of bankruptcy or intentional abuse; suggests that an EU-wide blacklist of such operators be established, on the basis of criteria clearly defined by the Commission, following consultations with transport and/or tourism operators and consumer protection organisations;\n",
        "63.      Welcomes the fact that the European Tourist Destinations Portal has been set up with the aid of Commission funding; calls on the Commission to continue to help promote Europe as a tourist destination or a collection of attractive tourist destinations, for instance by introducing and publicising a ‘Europe’ label and organising arrangements and channels for gathering information on European tourist destinations and subsequently circulating it to those working in the tourism industry outside Europe;\n",
        "64.      Welcomes the implementation of a selection process for a yearly ‘European destination of excellence’, as proposed in its abovementioned resolution of 8 September 2005; considers that those initiatives are valuable in that they make more visible the variety and wealth of European destinations; stresses the point that, wherever possible, the EU should promote those less known destinations, particularly in the new Member States;\n",
        "65.      Advocates, in view of the need to protect the quality of tourism in popular European tourist destinations, that this programme be used to develop responsible and sustainable tourism in all tourist regions of the EU;\n",
        "66.      Calls on the Commission and the Member States, given that cross-border infrastructure is essential for the European tourism sector, to improve such infrastructures, including recreational (inland) waterways;\n",
        "67.      Calls upon the Commission to promote more vigorously Europe’s transport and industrial heritage;\n",
        "68.      Encourages, therefore, initiatives seeking to enhance the European cultural heritage, such as the Council of Europe’s Cultural Routes, and urges that  their profile be raised; proposes, to that end, that support be given for the creation of a European Heritage label aimed at highlighting the European dimension of the EU’s sites and monuments;\n",
        "69.      Stresses the urgency of protecting traditional culture, and in particular endangered folk arts, crafts, trades and knowledge, which are essential for the preservation of  national identity and the attractiveness of rural areas for tourists;\n",
        "70.      Calls on the Commission to promote European destinations in those countries whose peak seasons coincide with the European low seasons and to look into the possibility of  endorsing  agreements, such as Memorandums of Understanding, with these third countries in order to develop tourist fluxes with an optimised seasonal spread;\n",
        "71.      Calls on the Commission to highlight the cultural dimension of European tourism by promoting European UNESCO world heritage sites as testimonies of European culture.\n",
        "72.      Urges the Commission to promote the cross-border memorial cycle route along the former Iron Curtain as an example of “gentle mobility” in tourism and as a symbol for the reunification of Europe;\n",
        "73.      Urges the Commission, the Member States, the regions, local authorities, and the tourism industry to coordinate the policies with a direct or indirect impact on tourism, cooperate more closely among themselves, and make better use of the European financial instruments available in the period from 2007 to 2013 with a view to developing European tourism, focusing on the competitiveness of the tourism industry and tourist destinations, the development of tourism enterprises, services, and facilities, job creation, mobility, and vocational training in the tourism sector, and economic diversification and the development of Europe’s regions, in particular the less-favoured regions;\n",
        "74.      Calls on the Commission to draw up a report in order to take into account the impact that actions and proposals in the area of Community policies are likely to have on the tourist industry;\n",

        "76.      Is aware of the benefit of coach holidays for tourists with lower incomes and for the development of tourism in regions which are not serviced by regional airports or railways; draws attention to the special situation of the small and medium-sized coach companies vis-à-vis the Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport[5], particularly for roundtrips; calls on the Commission to address this particular issue by examining possibilities of postponing the rest period after roundtrips (not exceeding 12 days);\n",
        "77.      Stresses that SMEs should have greater involvement in tourism-related entrepreneurship and that possibilities for simplifying procedures to obtain financial support should be found; further stresses  that EU sponsored training and best practice adoption courses should be introduced in regions, especially in countries that joined the EU after 2004;\n",
        "78.      Suggests that the Commission study the possibility of a “Youth Transport Pass” for young Europeans receiving Erasmus, Leonardo or Comenius grants or carrying out voluntary civilian service in the EU, so as to make it easier for them to travel and familiarise themselves with their host country;\n",
        "79.      Stresses that, on the basis that the Leonardo da Vinci programme is one of a kind in the tourism sector of numerous countries, these opportunities should be developed and promoted; emphasises that this would lead to a vast improvement in the educational programme; highlights that, in addition to the implementation of the programme, research into results achieved should be carried out ;\n",
        "80.      Draws attention once more, given the scale of forthcoming change in the demographic structure of the EU, to the need to implement a European tourist programme for retired people out of season, which would improve   the quality of life of senior citizens in the EU, create employment and generate greater demand and growth in the European economy; believes that this could be called the Ulysses Programme;\n",
