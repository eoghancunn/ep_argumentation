    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Welcomes the abovementioned joint report which covers both social protection and social inclusion for the first time at the level of the EU-25 and which looks at the progress of the Member States in achieving objectives agreed by the Lisbon European Council; notes that the report aims at making key inroads into the fight against social exclusion and the eradication of poverty by 2010 and also at helping Member States to reform social protection systems with a view to ensuring their ability to provide high-quality services andtheir adequacy and sustainability in the future;\n",
        "2.   Notes that the joint report states that the fight against poverty and social exclusion remains a major challenge for the Union and its Member States, as the income-based figures relating to poverty and social exclusion across the Union are very significant, with more than 68 million or 15 per cent of the EU population living at risk of poverty in 2002;\n",
        "3.   Notes that, despite the important structural improvements in the EU labour markets over the last decade, EU employment and participation levels remain insufficient and  unemployment remains high in a number of Member States, especially amongst certain categories of people, such as the young, older workers, women, and people with specific disadvantages; notes also that labour market exclusion has a national but also a local and regional dimension;\n",
        "4.   Draws attention to the fact that the recent economic slowdown, with rising unemployment and fewer job opportunities, puts more people at risk of poverty and exclusion and worsens the position of those already affected; this is particularly the case in some Member States that suffer from long-term unemployment or inactivity;\n",
        "5.Emphasises that employment must be viewed as the most effective safeguard against poverty and, consequently, that the financial attractiveness of work should be maintained through incentives for employment of women and the setting of qualitative objectives for the jobs that are offered;\n",
        "6.   Considers, in this regard, that efforts against poverty and social exclusion must be sustained and extended to improve the situation of those people most at risk of poverty and exclusion, such as those in casual employment,the unemployed, single parent households (usually headed by women), older people living alone, women, families with several dependants, disadvantaged children, as well as ethnic minorities, sick or disabled people, the homeless, victims of trafficking and victims of drug and alcohol dependency;\n",
        "7.   Considers that it is crucial to recognise the difficulties faced by people at a disadvantage, including disabled people, ethnic minorities and immigrants, in accessing or remaining on the labour market; calls on the Member States to support the integration of people at a disadvantage in order to prevent and combat social exclusion, as well as to promote education, encourage job creation, professional training and career development, the reconciliation of professional and family life and the right to equal access to health care and decent accommodation and ensure the sustainability of social protection systems; points in this regard to the necessity of improving comparable data;\n",
        "8.   Highlights the fact that tackling disadvantages in education and training and improving the qualifications of the labour force regardless of age, for men and women and  ethnic and national minorities, are key tools for combating unemployment;  notes also that addressing those inequalities is of particular importance for achieving the Lisbon targets regarding employment, quality of work and social inclusion;\n",
        "9.   Stresses in this respect that, as regards the Roma minority, it is desirable that members of that minority be given every motivation to have an interest in the further education of their children, the development of their children’s positive qualities and skills, and the presentation of those qualities and skills to the wider public; considers that examples of successful Roma demonstrate that belonging to a particular ethnic group is not a handicap in a democratic society;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Member States to exchange best practiceto prevent early departure from education, raise the level of education, especially in languages and new technologies, facilitate the transition from school to work, increase access to education and training for disadvantaged groups, including less skilled and older workers, and lay the ground for access to lifelong learning for all; stresses that these strategies should involve all the stakeholders concerned, including the social partners, but also the civil society and learning providers;\n",
        "11.Recommends that, in order to limit the exclusion of persons over the age of 50 and to help them remain on the job market, Member States guard against the risks of exclusion from the world of work by developing access to lifelong learning;\n",
        "12. Considers in this respect that, given the benefits that a qualified workforce brings to employers, it goes without saying that employers should be more involved in the process of lifelong learning;\n",
        "13. Points out, however, that in a number of cases neither a sufficient level of education nor repeated requalification guarantee employment; emphasises, therefore, the need to make greater use of not-for-profit public service work;\n",
        "14. Stresses that in fourteen out of the seventeen Member States for which data are available1child poverty rose during the 1990s; draws attention to the fact that persistent child poverty mainly concentrates on single-parent families, large families with three or more dependent children, immigrants and people from ethnic minorities, unemployed or under-employed parents; stresses that priority attention at EU and Member State level should be given to the prevention and elimination of the intergenerational transmission of poverty and that this should be underpinned by appropriate financial resources (such as increased use of Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund); underlines that indicators have to be approached from the child's perspective and that of people living alone, even if it is known that child poverty cannot be reduced without reducing household poverty and ensuring access to high-quality services for all;\n",
        "15. Points out that, according to Eurostat sources, a third of births in the EU now occur outside the institution of marriage, and that this figure increases annually; considers that this trend bears witness to the need to find effective mechanisms to promote the proper functioning of different types of familyas an institution;\n",
        "16. Considers that social services dealing with children and childcare are an important precondition for the  prevention and reduction of child poverty, social exclusion and discrimination,  and the facilitation of the reconciliation of work and family life; stresses the need to ensure easy and equal access to education for all children; recognises the vital role of private operators in supplying services in this regard;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to put forward a Green Paper on child poverty, setting out clear targets and appropriate measures to eliminate child poverty, as steps towards the social inclusion of poor children;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission to step up its efforts to introduce a ‘Children’s Charter’ that seeks to achieve progress in upholding the rights of the child as part of the EU's internal and external policy;\n",
        "19. Draws attention to the needs of young people, who face particular difficulties as regards economic and social integration )on leaving education and entering the world of work, and who are more susceptible to falling victim to social exclusion; calls on the Member States to ensure that youth unemployment is addressed specifically, as a priority in its own right, through specific policy measures and training, inter alia, to encourage of the taking of initiative and the development of entrepreneurial spirit;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Member States to develop integrated strategies seeking to promote, in economic, social, cultural and environmental terms, the development of geographically remote and underdeveloped urban, island and rural areas, with a view to confronting the problems of exclusion and poverty, not allowing them to endure from one generation to the next;\n",
        "21. Emphasises the need to increase the participation of women in employment by eliminating obstacles that prevent women from entering it, and particularly by encouraging older women to remain longer in the labour market;\n",
        "22.Recommends that the Member States support a policy of growth and female employment by facilitating women's access to quality jobs and promoting equal-wage conditions;\n",
        "23. Emphasises that increasing female activity rates must be viewed not only as a necessary safeguard against the risk of poverty, which primarily affects women, but also as a means to maintain the balance between the number of persons economically active and those inactive, which is endangered by the ageing of the population;\n",
        "24. Calls, in this regard, on the Member States to focus on the elimination of inequalities on the labour market, such as gender gaps in employment, unemployment and atypical employment, gender segregation in sectors and occupations, gender pay gaps, unequal status and the limited participation of women in decision-making positions; considers that, in doing so, Member States should facilitate personal choices in terms of the reconciliation of work and family life and access to quality and affordable care services for children and other dependants; further believes that it is essential to ensure the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in all policies and programmes;\n",
        "25. Furthermore, calls on the Member States to take action to ensure that women are not penalised, when their pension entitlement is calculated, for gaps in their employment record caused by maternity leave or parental leave;\n",
        "26. Calls on the Member States, in their fight against the high levels of exclusion faced by ethnic minorities and immigrants, to develop and implement measures, including measures to raise awareness, for the integration of these target groups into the formal labour market, to enforce anti-trafficking and anti-discrimination legislation, and to facilitate their social integration through specific provisions (and complex programmesrelating to special educational programmes, and decent living and housing conditions, as a precondition for social inclusion;\n",
        "27. Urges the Commission to put forward proposals aimed at setting up an appropriate legal framework to eradicate discrimination against people with disabilities, promoting equal opportunities and the full participation of such people in work, society and politics, specifically by means of a proposal for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty to cover the areas still not dealt with;\n",
        "28. Stresses the need to improve housing conditions, especially accessibility, for those less-favoured groups which are particularly affected by poverty, such as people at a disadvantage and older people who cannot look after themselves; demands that more attention be paid to the homeless, especially by providing care, imparting basic skills, and promoting social integration, which will necessitate public policies, especially in the areas of housing, health and education, to ensure that such people have access to those facilities;\n",
        "29. Moreover, considers, in this respect, that such basic skills, the teaching of which would not only be aimed at cultivating the abilities people need in order to look after themselves but which would also instil solidarity with the less able, should be taught continuously to the whole of European society, starting during primary education;\n",
        "30. Fully supports the Commission's intention to organise a European year of Equal Opportunities for All in 2007; considers that this should assist in highlighting the significance of the issue, assessing the progress achieved throughout the EU and providing a framework for further policy measures and initiatives with a view to enhancing the EU's anti-discrimination legislation, addressing direct and indirect discrimination and covering gender-equality in all areas;\n",
        "31. Welcomes the recognition that the most socially deprived people generally experience the poorest socio-environmental conditions and that this should be given due consideration when tackling social exclusion;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission to take legal action against Member States that do not apply or have failed to transpose by the deadline required the anti-discrimination Directives based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty;\n",
        "33. Reaffirms the need for an improvement in harmonised data collection and the development of common indicators that take account of age and sex differences, as indicators of this kind play a major role in the monitoring and evaluation of policies on poverty and social exclusion;\n",
        "34. Considers that a real mainstreaming of social inclusion in policy making should be implemented through the establishment of systematicex-anteandex-postpolicy assessments, both at national and EU level;\n",
        "35. Points out that the social-inclusion process should truly involve key actors at local or regional level, such as local authorities in charge of social-inclusion policies, social partners, NGOs and people experiencing poverty and social exclusion;\n",
        "36. Supports the intention of Commission to devote special attention to the task of combating poverty by organising the European Year of Combating Exclusion and Poverty;\n",
        "37. Considers that the rapid change arising from globalisation and the wide use of information and communication technologies increases the vulnerability to social risk and generates a need for more efficient measures of social protection with a view to ensuring the right of all to social protection;\n",
        "38. Points out that social security and benefit systems are often slow to respond to more flexible forms of employment and self-employment and fail to offer appropriate support and that this can prove a barrier to people taking up employment; considers therefore that this should be taken in to account when modernising systems;\n",
        "39. Considers that the current demographic trends - ageing workforce and decline of the working-age population - constitute a challenge in the medium and longer term for the financial sustainability of social protection systems;\n",
        "40. Points, in this regard, to the necessity of promoting the development and implementation of comprehensive ageing strategies aimed at empowering workers to stay active longer and encouragingemployers to hire and retain older workers;\n",
        "41. Urges the Commission to put forward proposals aimed at setting up an appropriate legal framework to eradicate discrimination against people on the basis of age;\n",
        "42. Considers, in this respect, that the European Social Fund may have an important role to play in the integration and reintegration of older workers into the labour market, and, more generally, in the social inclusion of vulnerable and/or socially-excluded groups;\n",
        "43. Considers that, in order for pension schemes to be financially sustainable, there is a need for economic growth and sufficient productivity, as well as high levels of employment and the active promotion of lifelong learning, quality of work and a safe and healthy working environment;\n",
        "44. Recommends that pension systems should not only consist of a wide range of forms of social and supplementary insurance (whether statutory or private) but should also guarantee, to the greatest possible extent, social justice in pension systems;\n",
        "45. Takes the view that, in order to prevent adverse effects on employment, reforms of public pensions systems should avoid increasing the total tax burden on labour, but achieve an appropriate balance between taxes on labour and taxes on other resources;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Member States to reinforce administrative and institutional capacity, including the improvement of equal access to high-quality services, particularly, in the fields of health and long-term care, social security, social services, including the provision of counselling in social rights, child-related services, transport and mobility services, reintegration services focused on the labour-market integration, and vocational training services;\n",
        "47. Awaits the Commission's document on minimum income as a potentially useful contribution to the debate on social inclusion and social protection;\n",
        "48. Welcomes the Council's decision regarding the application of the open method of coordination in the field of health and long-term care; points out that the organisation and delivery of services and medical care is and should remain an area of Member State competence; reiterates its support for the three fundamental objectives of health and long-term care: universal access, irrespective of income or wealth, a high level of quality, and financial sustainability;\n",
        "49. Stresses that particular attention should be paid to persons requiring long-term or expensive care, and to those facing particular difficulties in accessing care; emphasises that, if health is to be promoted and protected, health systems must be based not only on the insurance principle but also on the solidarity principle;\n",
        "50. Advocates, furthermore, the increase of all those social services needed with regard to the care of dependent persons, i.e. those unable to perform basic everyday actions by themselves;\n",
        "51. Notes that, although public pension schemes should remain an important source of pensioners' income, private provision through occupational or personal schemes can play a complementary role in obtaining additional pension entitlements;\n",
        "52. Points out, in this context, the need for coordination of comprehensive information and monitoring systems highlighting the consequences for the income and living standards of individuals;\n",
        "53. Stresses the importance of a continuous evaluation of pension systems' effectiveness with regard to their financial sustainability, as well as the achievement of social objectives;\n",
        "54. Calls on the European Council, in the interest of streamlining and simplifying the open method of coordination, to adopt at its summit in Spring 2006 an integrated framework in the fields of social protection and integration and to agree on a uniform list of common objectives in the field of social integration, pensions, health and long-term care;\n",
        "55. Regards the creation of an integrated framework and the streamlining of coordination in the fields of social protection and integration as an opportunity, in the context of the Lisbon process, to boost the social dimension of social protection as a dimension with its own independent socio-economic significance as opposed to the coordination of social and employment policy;\n",
        "56. Calls on the Member States and the Commission, when applying the open method of coordination to social protection and integration, to pay greater attention in the future to issues of reconciling work and family life, with particular emphasis on access to childcare, family income situations and the employment rate of mothers;\n",
        "57. Calls on the Member States to make optimal use of the potential offered by the open method of coordination process, as an instrument of policy making in the fields of employment, social protection, social inclusion, pensions and health;\n",
        "58. Calls on the Member States - particularly the new Member States - to review their pension systems, taking account of the significantly lower life expectancy of men and the major pay differentials between men and women, which are reflected in the size of the pensions of widowed pensioners, often pushing them below the poverty line;\n",
        "59. Points out that the development and maintenance of the social security systems is closely linked to the Lisbon goals and can make an important contribution to increased employment and growth, greater solidarity and better social integration;\n",
        "60. Reiterates its conviction that its role in applying of the open method of coordination – in its capacity as the body directly representing the citizens of Europe – must be clarified and enhanced in order to give the process democratic legitimacy;\n",
        "61. Calls on the Council and Commission to open negotiations with the European Parliament on an inter-institutional agreement setting out the rules for selecting the areas of policy to which the open method of coordination is to be applied, and providing for a coherent application of the method with the unrestricted and equal participation of the European Parliament;\n",
        "62. Stresses that such an inter-institutional agreement must contain rules for the participation of the European Parliament in the setting of objectives and indicators and in access to documents, participation in meetings, observation and supervision of progress, information on reports and best practices, and a procedure enabling the open method of coordination to evolve into a Community method;\n",
        "63.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Social Protection Committee, the Member States and the parliaments of the Member States, the accession countries and the candidate countries.\n"
