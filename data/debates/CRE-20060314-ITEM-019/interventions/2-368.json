{"speaker": "Vladimír Špidla,", "english": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the high standard of this debate and of the proposals submitted by Members, and I would like again to confirm my willingness to work alongside you towards fulfilling the aims of the Union and fulfilling the role given to us by the citizens of Europe. I can assure you that the Commission is contributing determinedly to further raising the profile of the social dimension in the Lisbon Strategy. I would like to suggest to you some ideas for our work in the future.\nWe must first raise the profile of European coordination. We have managed to develop a balanced approach, which places emphasis on the need to combine social aims with financial targets. This is a great achievement and it is fundamental to reinforcing the faith of citizens in the reforms. We must enhance the partnership between the Member States and the Union. The European strategy for growth and employment and the social agenda do not belong to the Commission or to the European bodies. They are based on the obligation of all participants, Member States, European citizens, parliaments, social partners and interest groups as well as all the institutions and organs of the Community. Success in this partnership will require a clear separation of roles. The Member States will implement the intra-state level reforms and the structural policies approved within the framework of the revised Lisbon Strategy. The Union will continue to support reform efforts and will at the same time make use of all new instruments, assistance from the Structural Funds, respect for fundamental rights, support for social dialogue and the establishment of proven approaches.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission .
