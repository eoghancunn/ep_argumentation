{"speaker": "Proinsias De Rossa,", "english": "Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla, and Mrs Bauer, for the report and for the initiative regarding social protection and inclusion. That we have close to 70 million people living at risk in the European Union is a shameful statistic and is not acceptable.\nPoverty is a result of the actions of human beings and it can be resolved by the actions of intelligent human beings. We know what solves poverty, yet our economic system continues to reproduce misery for tens of millions of people and, as has been pointed out, continues from generation to generation.\nWe do so because we fail at national level to integrate the various economic, social, cultural and environmental policies that we pursue. We fail to mainstream the solutions that various boards and reports have identified. One of the single most important solutions is not, as is often argued, a job; it is actually education: education from pre-school, certainly primary education, and at a minimum through to secondary education.\nEmployment obviously plays a key role, but it must be remarked that too many of our homeless, and indeed our poor, actually have a job. It is therefore clear that the job must be a quality job with decent pay and conditions if it is to have an impact on resolving the issue of poverty.\nI would argue as well that social protection has to be seen as broader than simply social security. Our public services should be seen as mechanisms for social protection. Health services, education services, transport and cultural services not only help to protect those who are at risk of poverty, but also keep tens if not hundreds of millions out of poverty by their very existence. If they did not exist there would be many more millions of people on the breadline.\nI would argue too that the notion that social security is simply a safety net needs to be avoided and that in reforming our social security systems we have to give particular attention to eliminating poverty traps.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla, and Mrs Bauer, for the report and for the initiative regarding social protection and inclusion.
