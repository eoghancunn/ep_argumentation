{"speaker": "Vladimír Špidla,", "english": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission . (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, for her report, and I am delighted that I can report complete agreement between yourselves and the Commission regarding the fact that the Lisbon Strategy is based on the positive combined operation of economic policy, employment policy and social policy. I appreciate the backing expressed in the report for the Commission’s initiative aimed at modernising and making more effective the open method of coordination for the areas of social protection and social inclusion. The question is one of how to contribute more through social policy to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, while at the same time strengthening the coordination of these policies. Contributing more through the Lisbon Strategy process of social coordination involves developing active functions of social protection and demonstrating added value on the basis of the jobs and growth created. From a practical viewpoint, both the new common goals for the open method of coordination and the partial thematic goals just adopted by the Council will be carried across into national strategies. The new national bodies will first of all present a strategic approach for every Member State regarding the modernisation of their policy in specific areas. The Member States will then present the three thematic plans: social inclusion, pensions and health care.\nThe Commission has also adopted a communication that initiates a public consultation on possible targeted measures at a Union level relating to adjustments in minimum wages and the inclusion of persons excluded from the labour market. The consultation also includes the European Parliament and other organisations, of course, but in view of the theme under discussion it will be extended to public bodies at all levels, as well as to organisations, interest groups and social partners. Your report also ushers in the possibility of new inter-institutional agreements which would cement the role of Parliament in implementing the open method of coordination. It is true that the participation of Parliament in work within the context of open coordination remains limited by the fact that there is no overall statutory framework in place. For my part, I can assure Members that I am backing the efforts of officials in my departments to pursue further dialogue with Parliament.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Vladimír Špidla, Member of the Commission .
