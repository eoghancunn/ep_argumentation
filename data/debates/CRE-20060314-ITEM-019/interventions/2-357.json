{"speaker": "Jean Lambert,", "english": "Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Bauer for the work she has done on this excellent report, and the Commission for its initial document.\nOne of the points that comes through from the report is that there is multiple deprivation often linked to discrimination; that if you look at some of the groups that are particularly affected – women, as we have just heard, people with disabilities, those from black and minority ethnic groups and those both older and younger – you can see why the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination are so important and why they need to be implemented as fully as possible.\nThe concentration on child poverty is welcome. We know that there are links between poor nutrition, poor housing, a poor environment – the poor often live in the worst environments – and poor educational prospects, which then follow through people’s lives and indeed those of their children. I welcome the call for a Green Paper on child poverty. We need to look at that in the context of social cohesion overall, because it has implications for the gap between rich and poor.\nMr De Rossa mentioned the difficulties about education and employment. The real cause of poverty is not having enough cash. You cannot simply rely on a trickle down from growth in the economy. You have to take specific action to address those at the bottom. Take the example of the UK, which comes out quite high in terms of risk of poverty. Despite the number of efforts made by our government at the moment, you see that the share of the poorest 10% in the population’s net income is 2.8%, while that of the richest 10% is 28%: ten times as much. You can see it in my own region, inner London, the richest area in the European Union, which also has tremendous levels of poverty. We need to change those percentages and increase that of those at the bottom.\nI agree about the importance of public services and the role that social security has to play within this. Member States should be looking at whether their social security systems operate to allow people to go through training and to take up educational possibilities, or whether they in fact constrict them because these people have to be ready for work at any moment.\nI would also echo the comments made about the open method of coordination and the role that the European Parliament should be playing in this, not least in reviewing the national action plans and their outcomes.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Bauer for the work she has done on this excellent report, and the Commission for its initial document.\nOne of the points that comes through from the report is that there is multiple deprivation often linked to discrimination; that if you look at some of the groups that are particularly affected – women, as we have just heard, people with disabilities, those from black and minority ethnic groups and those both older and younger – you can see why the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination are so important and why they need to be implemented as fully as possible.\nThe concentration on child poverty is welcome.
