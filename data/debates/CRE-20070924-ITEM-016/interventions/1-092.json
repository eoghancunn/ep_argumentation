{"speaker": "Lena Ek (ALDE). –", "english": "Lena Ek (ALDE). – Mr President, Churchill once said that the best way to make a task seem difficult is to postpone it, and I think that is one way of describing the energy debate we are having in Europe today.

It is also nice for everyone – for all voters, industry and citizens in Europe – to see that Parliament, thanks to Ms Thomsen’s work on this report, is also very decided that this is a good way to work and that this is the way we should do it.\nIs it possible? There are question marks, of course, when people ask questions. I think it is perfectly possible. If we look at what can be done in industry by trigeneration and by using renewables, it is perfectly possible. In households, on heating and cooling, it is also perfectly possible, and in the transport sector also. I am very happy that, in combination with what we have here on renewables, other regulations in place in Europe are changed. It is about time we put more ethanol in petrol, and with the new decisions we will at least have half the rate that Brazil has.
