As indigenous fuel, peat has a considerable effect on regional policy, and it increases employment and the security of energy supply.\nNo emission-free, low-emission or other form of generation that is emission-neutral, sustainable and cost-efficient can be ruled out, including nuclear power. All forms of energy must be assessed on the basis of the overall interests of society.\nThe share of carbonless energy sources, including nuclear energy, should be increased in the fight against climate change. Nuclear power increases independence from imported energy, is environmentally cleaner than other options and an economical energy source.\nI therefore find it very important that Member States are free to choose the most appropriate renewable energy sources given the differences in geological, hydrological and climatic conditions in the Member States.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE), in writing . – Finland is one of the world’s leading countries in utilising renewable energy sources, especially bioenergy.
