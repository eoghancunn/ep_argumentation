We do not always get applause and cheers and shouts. I know it is forbidden, but I think it is actually quite fun, so it should be allowed.\nIf you would allow me, I would like to make three points. The first one is actually an echo of what the Commissioner said. I think that we need a common energy policy. It is very important, of course, that we look at the national targets, but as an overall approach we must look at it from a common perspective. This means that we need to revise a lot of the legislation in the pipeline and we need to focus, as Mr Paasilinna said earlier, on a proper energy mix while looking at the whole programme.\nMy second observation is about fair burden-sharing and I am quite happy with the 2020 aims in this respect: they are good and they are ambitious. I am not 100% sure that we will ever achieve them, especially on the renewables side, but nevertheless it is a good aim. But, in doing this, it is very important that we have a careful look at the burden-sharing. I do not want to be in a situation whereby small states such as Finland, which already has 25% renewables today, have to hike up their burden to, say, 45%, whereas the five biggest Member States, which actually consume 60% of energy, keep much lower standards. So let us be really fair on this. On top of that, of course, a country like Finland is not going to have too much solar energy, unfortunately.\nThe third observation I have is about the methodology for calculation. It seems that wind and solar are penalised in relation to biomass. Fine, let us try to live with it but look at it very closely. With the national action plans, I would like to hope that the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport has enough staff, or is able to recruit enough staff, to deal with, monitor and implement the issues.\nIn my remaining time, these are my three points: firstly, we need a common energy policy, secondly we need fair burden-sharing and, thirdly, we need to be very careful with the methodology for calculation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I think it is actually quite fun to have a lively audience.
