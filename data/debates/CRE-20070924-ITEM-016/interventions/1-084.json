{"speaker": "Fiona Hall,", "english": "Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, may I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report. Renewables have been part of the energy mix in Europe and part of European energy policy for a number of years and this report very usefully highlights why they have not yet expanded to their full potential.\nOne of the problems has been access to the grid. We have a distribution network for electricity which was designed to be one-way and now requires technical adjustments in order to become two-way and be able to handle decentralised electricity generation. Member States should be doing more to get rid of the technical and administrative barriers currently hampering the expansion of renewable electricity.\nThe biggest potential from renewables exists at the two ends of the scale. On the one hand, we need a new commitment and investment in large-scale renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms in northern Europe, solar collectors around the Mediterranean and tidal barriers. At the same time, at the other end of the scale, we need to maximise use of renewables at a domestic level – technology such as solar thermal, photovoltaic panels, heat pumps and biomass heating. I particularly welcome paragraph 38, which stresses the need for compulsory use of renewable technologies in all new and renovated buildings.\nIt is time for a major revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, not least because the renewables roadmap needs to be considered hand in hand with the EU’s action plan on energy efficiency. The binding target of 20% EU energy from renewables by 2020 is much more likely to be met if we succeed in cutting total EU energy consumption. The way to cut carbon emissions is to have renewables as an increasing element of a decreasing energy requirement.\nOn the question of biofuels, I would emphasise the absolute necessity for all biofuels, whether imported or produced in Europe, to satisfy sustainability criteria in respect of net CO 2 savings, biodiversity protection, water resources and effects on food production. But I think we should accept the Commissioner’s reassurances and continue to support the 10% biofuels target. In December, though, we will need to look very carefully at the Commission’s proposals to make sure that they meet the strict sustainability criteria Parliament is demanding.\nFinally, this roadmap for renewable energy should not just be a roadmap for Europe. By supporting investment in renewable energy technology in the developing world, we can achieve two crucial objectives. First, much-needed growth can be achieved without the cost to the planet of increased carbon emissions and, secondly, developing countries can achieve, through renewables, a degree of energy independence and energy security. They can be sheltered from the fossil fuel price shocks which have ruined so many developing economies in the past.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, may I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report.
