{"speaker": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE). – Mr President, colleagues, first let me emphasise that I welcome the Commission and Ms Descamps’ report on digital libraries as a timely and important contribution towards ensuring that digital information is preserved for future generations.\nIt is true that the internet has become one of the principal means of access to knowledge and learning. Digital libraries would surely benefit many researchers, students, teachers and – as one specific group – people with physical disabilities. So this is a perfect initiative in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All.\nI would just like to draw your attention to one aspect that needs to be thoroughly assessed before making decisions.\nPublic/private cooperation and private sponsorship for the digitalisation of Europe’s cultural heritage is an important element of the system as it now stands. We need to make sure that new regulations in this field do not threaten the benefits of the current system, especially on scientific information. For example, we have to make sure that the peer review mechanism is safeguarded. Peer review is the process by which independent experts in a scientific discipline – the peers – critically assess a scientific paper reporting on research.\nThe peer review system is critical for the scientific community as it is an important quality control mechanism and can influence scientific careers. We also need to avoid a scenario where open access puts the existing dissemination of scientific research through subscription journals at risk. One question to be assessed is also damage to the profitability of journals from small publishing houses.\nIn short, the current system is perceived by many stakeholders as easy to access, efficient, cost-effective and also of high quality. We have to be sure that the benefits, especially for researchers, will be on the positive side and we must avoid any unintended negative consequences for the very people we are hoping to assist.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE). – Mr President, colleagues, first let me emphasise that I welcome the Commission and Ms Descamps’ report on digital libraries as a timely and important contribution towards ensuring that digital information is preserved for future generations.\nIt is true that the internet has become one of the principal means of access to knowledge and learning.
