        "1.        Considers that its previous, above-mentioned, resolutions on SGIs of 13 November 2001, 14 January 2004 and of 22 February 2005 remain valid, particularly in view of\n",
        "2.        Notes that it is particularly important, so as to exploit fully the opportunities offered by the internal market, for the conditions and provisions regulating the modernisation of markets to guarantee fair, transparent and efficient competition, while maintaining social cohesion and universal service accessibility, and avoid abuses of dominant position and the formation of new monopolies, which hamper access to the market for new participants;\n",
        "3.        Stresses that SGIs should be of high quality, should encompass comprehensive coverage, should be provided at optimum cost, should respect social balance and should be provided on the basis of lasting security of supply; and emphasises that the majority of SGIs can be provided under conditions of fair competition, according to the principle that private and public undertakings must receive equal treatment;\n",
        "4.        Requests that the Commission submit to Parliament a comprehensive analysis of the effects of liberalisation to date, in particular on the situation of consumers and the employees concerned;\n",
        "5.        Emphasises that most SGEIs are supplied in the internal market and are therefore, as a matter of principle, subject to internal market, public procurement, competition and State aid legislation and Commission controls on abuses in so far as the application of such legislation does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them, as provided in Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty; emphasises that, in accordance with Article 16 of the EC Treaty concerning SGIs, the Community and Member States are responsible, within their respective powers, for ensuring that such services operate on the basis of principles and conditions that enable them to fulfil their missions;\n",
        "6.        Underlines that especially after the enlargement of the European Union, cohesion must be ensured in the field of SGEIs and that in the framework of structural policy, Member States' infrastructures for network-based SGEIs must be interlinked and cross-border cooperation enhanced in order to create a real internal market and to facilitate standardisation;\n",
        "7.        Takes into consideration the economic weight of these services and their importance for the production of other goods and the provision of other services; underlines that the way in which SGEIs are organised can affect the internal market, for example by prohibiting establishment in the country in which the service is provided;\n",
        "8.        Considers that the objective of competition rules should be to improve the quality of service provision, consumer choice and affordable prices and to realise other public interest objectives, including sustainable development;\n",
        "9.        Calls on the Commission to clarify the distinction between SGIs and SGEIs by developing operational criteria, taking into account Member States’ national tradition, based on the nature of collective goods and public funding or by solidarity mechanisms of SGIs; underlines that for many SGIs making the distinction between economic and non-economic aspects is extremely difficult due to the dynamic character of these services and their rapid development; welcomes, therefore, the fact that, in its White Paper on SGIs, the Commission indicates that \"the effective performance of a general interest task prevails, in case of tension, over the application of Treaty rules\"; recognises that broad areas of SGIs must not be withdrawn from the scope of the rules of the internal market and competition through an attempt to define SGIs;notes that a precise definition of SGEI and SGI would run counter to the freedom of Member States to define their SGIs;\n",
        "10.      Recalls  the fact that the rules in force in this area are defined by  the case-law of the Court of Justice and by the  Commission's, interpretation of  individual cases, and that neither the necessary legal certainty nor adequate transparency has therefore yet been achieved;\n",
        "11.      Requests furthermore clarification from the Commission in particular on two major questions: consequences of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice based on a sectoral approach and application of competition law to SGIs and SGEIs, especially with regard to the financing of these services;\n",
        "12.      Notes that local and regional authorities have proved to be the appropriate level, close to the citizen, for providing SGIs, and that they are still the appropriate level for guaranteeing the right of involvement, consumer protection and public welfare in respect of such services; notes that the European level of government must help ensure that the capacity of the local and regional level of government to provide such services is not jeopardised;\n",
        "13.      Is of the opinion, therefore, that, in the interests of:\n",
        "14.      Emphasises that the need for existing or future sector-specific regulations based on internal market rules and respect for subsidiarity and that sector-specificrules should not be called into question;recalls the success of these sector-specific regulations and recommends that the sectoral approach be expanded into other sectors;\n",
        "15.      Calls on the Commission to create more legal certainty in the area of social and health care SGIs and to come forward with a proposal for a sector-specific directive of the Council and the Parliament and those fields where it is appropriate;\n",
        "16.      Urges the Council, therefore, to adopt a common position as soon as possible on the revision of Regulation (EEC) No 1191/69 of 26 June 1969 on action by Member States concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service in transport by rail, road and inland waterway[11];\n",
        "17.      Recommends that, when a competent authority identifies the supply of a service as a service of general economic interest, the public service obligation should be assigned either by way of a fair and transparent tendering procedure or by way of a suitable legal act that must satisfy transparency criteria and must be based on equal conditions for all competitors;\n",
        "18.      Welcomes the proposed Community legal framework for State aid in the form of compensation for public service obligations and the plan to revise the transparency directive;\n",
        "19.      Recommends that, when a competent authority intends to finance SGEIs other than through direct funding from its general budget, the authority in question should choose,  a  form of funding that is  in compliance with the provisions of the EC Treaty, particularly of Article 86(2), especially when granting exclusive and special rights, granting compensation for the supply of public services or when setting up a fund for the supply of public services, notes that in all cases this will require a transparent  tariff system as well as appropriate and transparent financing;\n",
        "20.      Recommends that, when a competent authority intends to grant compensation for the supply of public services in order to ensure the funding of a service of general interest, such compensation should not be considered State aid in the meaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty, provided that:\n",
        "21.      Points to the importance of applying the provisions of Commission Decision of 28 November 2005 on the application of Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty to State aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of SGEIs[12]must be implemented clearly; emphasises, however, that the payment of pure compensation for public service obligations should not be deemed to be State aid, and that the law should be amended accordingly;\n",
        "22.      Emphasises that it is for the competent authority to decide whether to supply a service of general interest directly by a unit of its own or,  to entrust supply thereof to external profit or non-profit service providers, while exercising the same control as that provided for directly supplied services; in case the competent authority decides to externalize the services  a call for tenders must be issued; moreover the principle of local and regional self-government should be respected, which gives the competent authority the right to choose, taking into account the public interest, how best each service should be delivered;\n",
        "23.      Is of the opinion that outsourcing the supply of a service of general interest normally imposes on the authority in question the obligation to assign the service on the basis of a public service contract, following a public tender procedure; notes that the  principle of awarding a public service contract should  allow the competent authority the opportunity to transfer a public service contract in emergencies; calls on the Commission, together with the Member States and the Parliament, to clarify the relevant criteria in the procurement directives or in the form of a regulation; in this context, affirms that local authorities should be able to assign service tasks directly to inter-communal companies or similar forms of joint arrangements, or to companies that they own or control, provided that such bodies carry out the essential part of their activities for the controlling authority or authorities, and do not compete on external markets but constitute only a domestic organisational practice and an arrangement must be found which does not categorically exclude private participation from the outset;\n",
        "24.      Calls in this connection, and in the interests of possible improvements in efficiency through the involvement of new operators and ways of providing SGIs, for more legal certainty as a matter of urgency as regards the different forms of inter-authority organisations (cooperation between local authorities,  public-private partnership, awarding of concessions), a clarification of European law on competition, on the award of contracts and on State aid, and of the general criteria applicable throughout Europe; stresses that there should be legal clarification concerning the outsourcing of public services, which is different in kind from public contracts; calls on the Commission to spell out the rules for awarding such outsourced services and to make a clear distinction between those rules and the rules governing public contracts;\n",
        "25.      Is of the opinion that the competent authority should ensure that in the sectors in which it has laid down rules for public universal service obligations or particular objectives, the types of regulation and instruments appropriate to each sector should be applied on the basis of transparent rules;\n",
        "26.      Is also of the opinion that guidelines at national and local level are necessary in the following areas, in the interests of transparency and consumer protection:\n",
        "27.      Recommends, in the interests of high-quality and efficient SGIs, encouraging voluntary benchmarking and quality measurement mechanisms at national and European level; the exchange of experience and the promotion of best practices should be supported and involve all stakeholders concerned; suggests that such measures address the following aspects :\n",
        "28.      Stresses the importance of strengthening Member States´ supervisory capacities in order to ensure that public policy objectives, including affordability and quality standards, are effectively achieved; stresses further that it is necessary for the relevant public authorities to have adequate instruments and expertise at their disposal to be able to enforce competition and to ensure consumer protection;\n",
        "29.      Calls on the Commission, on the basis of its resolution of 14 January 2004, its resolution of 9 March 2005 on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy[13], and the present resolution, to come forward with appropriate legal initiatives and recalls that codecision rights, where foreseen by the Treaty, should be fully exercised by all parties involved in the field of SGIs and SGEIs;\n",
        "30.      Points out that the international agreements concluded by the Community and the obligations attaching thereto must be compatible with internal Community policies and rules;\n",
        "31.      Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
