{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to make three points.\nFirstly, I think services should be open to competition. That is why we are here and why we have European integration. It is clear that Member States cannot sustain their welfare systems without the help of the private sector. This whole debate is about having specific public services of general interest. It has happened in a country near my own, Finland, formerly the Soviet Union. It is absurd to think that services of general interest can be provided only by the public sector. I should therefore like to promote public-private partnerships. We should draw some lessons from the debate we had on the Services Directive.\nMy second point, then, is: no framework directive! There is no basis for it. I do not want the Commission to come up with anything, not even a consolidating document. It falls within the competence of the Member States. It adds no value whatsoever. Face the facts: the Commission’s study makes it clear that there are huge differences between what we consider to be a service of general interest in Finland, for instance, and what is considered to be a service of general interest in France. This debate is a smokescreen for monopolies and for protectionism. That to me is completely anti-European.\nFinally, I wish to second what my Polish colleague Mrs Handzlik said. What is the right solution? It is clear that we must have a sector-specific approach. We have to go sector by sector, focus on cooperation and have clear priorities: healthcare, postal services, water and gas services and so on, but without a directive. Let us stay clear of it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should like to make three points.\nFirstly, I think services should be open to competition.
