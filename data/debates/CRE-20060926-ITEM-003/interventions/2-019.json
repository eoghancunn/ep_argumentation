{"speaker": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE),", "english": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . – Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Rapkay for the enormous amount of work he has done on this report. Indeed I welcome the presence this morning of President Barroso on this important issue. It is a signal of the importance that the Commission attaches to this issue.\nThere is a broad consensus in Parliament about the role of services of general interest, economic interest, and of their importance. There are divisions largely on questions of strategy and, in some cases, tactics. There is a commitment here – and also on the part of the Commission – to ensure that any legislation or moves in that area will be by codecision. That is enormously important for the credibility of what we do in that area and for our legitimacy with our citizens in what we do in that area.\nI favour a framework directive. That was one of the decisions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in its opinion on the report. However, two weeks ago Parliament said ‘no’ to a framework directive. I believe it would be a mistake to try to push that through again.\nWe need to find a pragmatic way of moving forward to ensure that we get clarity and an assertion of the principle you have outlined here today: that when it comes to a conflict between the right of the citizen to public services and the market, that is set down in legislation. We should not leave that issue to a decision by the courts on a case-by-case basis; otherwise we would end up with all kinds of conflicting results. It is in that context that I favour a framework directive. Perhaps that can be found in another way. We need to search for that.\nI welcome your commitment to take action in the social services and health area. That is also an urgent matter.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . – Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Rapkay for the enormous amount of work he has done on this report.
