{"speaker": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to get this debate back, as my colleague Mr Karas said, to the people who really matter in all of this: our citizens receiving public services. We know that in many cases those public services are not good enough, not efficient enough and are delivered at much too high a cost.\nMr Barroso, whom we are delighted to see here this morning, made an important point in his principles for the promotion of good-quality public-service delivery. He mentioned the crucial factor of how technology is now enabling those services to be transformed and new models of organisation and delivery to be sustained. Those are the things we should be talking about. We should be thinking about the diversity that is engaging the best minds, the best technology, the best people and the best managers involved in delivering those services.\nHowever, the debate we have had, principally from that side of the House, has mainly been concerned with organisational models and protectionism. With the Services Directive in place, thanks to our efforts, more of those minds can be unleashed on delivery of services. We have work to do on public procurement from recent hearings in our committee. We have work to do on competition law. If those are included within Mr Barroso’s idea of consolidation, that is fine. However, we do not want a directive of the kind set out here, which is a naked political directive. They gave the game away in their interventions. Mrs Schroedter said that it would protect against liberalisation. That is what it is all about, Mr Barroso! Have nothing to do with it. Tell us today that you will take it off your agenda. I have asked in my committee, but with no reply, what problems for our citizens this directive is intended to solve. When those on the Left give us a comprehensive analysis of those problems, we might consider it, but we have far more important things to do today than to talk about their political declaration.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Malcolm Harbour (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to get this debate back, as my colleague Mr Karas said, to the people who really matter in all of this: our citizens receiving public services.
