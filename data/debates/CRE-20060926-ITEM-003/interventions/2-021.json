In this regard, we also agreed with the point that there is no need for a framework directive at Community level. At the same time, with respect to these questions, there are, in my view, three essential fundamental principles.\nThe first and most important principle is that of subsidiarity. We have in Europe a great diversity of systems for providing public services. This diversity cannot be reduced to uniformity. As a consequence, if Europe does not want to take over responsibility for public service provision, then it cannot make these perspectives uniform. That is to say, these questions have to remain within the competence of local authorities.\nThe second principle is the question of a gradual approach. The European Union and the European Commission are moving in the right direction in deciding in favour of gradual regulation, and this leads to the third point, the matter of a sectoral approach. We have already been very successful in regulating various sectors in the field of telecommunications among others. We should strive to follow this example and to monitor it on a continual basis.\nI agree, and so did our committee, that greater legal certainty is, of course, necessary. And as the representative of a new Member State, I would like to say as well that in view of the principle of equal access, the European Union does indeed have to guarantee a common basis with the help of the harmonisation and cohesion funds. In the new Member States, the tools for enforcing competition and for consumer protection are in many cases very weak. It is essential that these be strengthened, precisely in order that both equal access and competition be realised in these territories.\nI consider the report on services of general interest to be a good report, and believe that Mr Rapkay and his colleagues have done outstanding work. But I would like to ask everyone not to misunderstand it and not to see elements in this report which are not there. That is to say, we cannot speak in this regard of a framework directive or of a communication on a framework directive.\nIt is also very important that the question of a general directive on services is closely related to this question. Here, too, we need to see things clearly. The directive on services has, on many points, set down the framework within which we can work in this regard.", "lang": "EN", "original": "József Szájer (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection . – ( HU) Madam President, Mr Schulz has very good eyes, because he sees things in this resolution that are not there.\nI would like to indicate that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection agreed in large part with the White Paper which the Commission presented to Parliament.
