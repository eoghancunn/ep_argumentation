That is a very strong foundation for the adoption of specific new measures to apply the strategy. These measures are already at the preparation stage.\nI should like, so as not to take up too much time, to say a couple of words about the points raised by Mr Callanan. The environmental repercussions from mercury are still important and there are suitable alternative solutions. Similarly, suitable adaptation is not a problem for small producers, which is why the Commission too has proposed a ban on the use of mercury in these measuring devices. As regards the question of dental amalgams, the Commission will ask the relevant medical working party to study new measures and will call for the opinion of the scientific committee on the danger to health and the environment.\nTo finish, I should like once again to thank Parliament and Mr Matsakis in particular for his particularly positive stand on the strategy.
