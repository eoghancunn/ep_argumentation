{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on deciding to eliminate mercury. That decision is long overdue. We have known that mercury is dangerous for a long time. I want to congratulate Mr Matsakis on an excellent report that goes further than the Commission, especially in identifying for the Commission one of the most dangerous uses of mercury today: thermerasol – mercury directly injected in commonly-used medications such as flu vaccines. Since removing mercury from paediatric vaccines in California, cases of autism are continuing to increase. However, for the first time in over 20 years the rate of increase has significantly slowed down. Commissioner, please ensure that, if there is an avian flu jab, it will be mercury-free.\nThere is one more source of mercury that I would ask you to eliminate. The Irish Government pollutes the Irish water supply with hexafluorosilic acid, a waste product of the artificial fertiliser industry which, in addition to mercury, contains other toxins such as lead, arsenic, beryllium, vanadium, cadmium, radionuclides and silicone. Please tackle that.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on deciding to eliminate mercury.
