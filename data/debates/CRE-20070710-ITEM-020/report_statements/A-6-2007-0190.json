    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Stresses the need for pragmatic and cooperative interconnection in the field of transport and in other national or Community policy areas such as energy, environment and innovation; emphasises that these policies must incorporate the requirements of climate protection as well; considers that only an integrated approach could achieve positive results in reducing casualties and emissions and improving safety and environment, as it was laid down for example by CARS 21; points out the importance of providing targeted information for citizens in their capacity as transport users and to encourage them to behave more responsibly; proposes that transport policy should be fully integrated into the Lisbon Strategy and taken into account in the assessment and recommendations put forward each year by the Member States in their national plans in order to measure and compare progress;\n",
        "2.  Fully agrees that Community legislation - in line with the principle of Better Regulation and the principle of subsidiarity - should focus on new areas such as urban transport, where legislation is necessary and policy measures should be taken at EU level only where it would bring clear added value to replace the inordinate red tape entailed in 27 bodies of national legislation on the same subject, and at the same time calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the implementation and enforcement of the existing European transport legislation, further calls on the Commission to carry out regular monitoring to observe the effectiveness of measures seeking to achieve the objectives set and, where necessary, to make corrective changes;\n",
        "3.  Deplores the conditions under which the Union’s transport policy is being implemented by the Council and calls strongly for decisions to be taken more quickly under the legislative procedure and for swifter and better coordinated transposal into national law; calls on the Commission to do all in its power to achieve this goal;\n",
        "4.  Notes that Community funds for financing trans-European transport projects remain limited, and the added value of the TEN-T programme cannot be attained unless the entire network is completed, emphasises the financing of infrastructures (especially where congestion problems are significant), the cross border sections and transport hubs; considers that priority investment progress is slower than expected; emphasises that the key TEN-T projects - supervised by their coordinators - need to be selected according to their financial feasibility and in particular according to the financial willingness of the Member States concerned and their regions, and furthermore by their level of operational feasibility and of the progress of their technical planning so as to ensure that the declarations of intent find practical expression in the investment schedules to be incorporated in the Member States’ various finance laws; considers that these projects should provide proven 'pan-European added value' in terms of setting up a genuinely interconnected and interoperable trans-European network in order to avoid creating a patchwork of national networks;\n",
        "5.  Stresses that there is a significant risk to European economic growth from continued financial inaction as regards infrastructure; calls on the Commission to make proposals about the possible extension of new alternative and innovative ways of financing - taking into account also the report on the future of the European Union’s own resources - and also extra resources for transport and the related researches too during the review of the European 7-year budget in 2008; emphasises that it should include finding sources for transport investments, and not least fair charging - based on the \"user pays\" principle and the ability to apply the \"polluter pays\" principle - provided that the revenue is reinvested in the transport sector; believes that the Commission and the Member States should together consider the long term financial problems of constructing the TEN-T as a whole and making it operational, bearing in mind that the building time will cover at least two 7-year financial periods and the life cycle of new infrastructure is at least some decades;\n",
        "6.  Welcomes the establishment of the Guarantee Fund but expects more initiatives like this especially when the PPPs - in a proper legal framework - will be able to play a role in financing but not without clear economic and financial viability; highlights that the role of the EIB, which must, however, be made compatible with the wider involvement of the European banking and financial system in infrastructure and transport projects;\n",
        "7.  Points out that the geographical extension of the Union caused a significant increase in diversity, because of which, before legislating, in-depth impact analyses should make the Union aware of the possible effect on each Member State, especially on the newcomers; calls on the Institutions and the Member States to do their best in order to exploit fully the funds related to the development of transport; considers that a qualitative progress could be made with the help of co-modality and intelligent transport, where there is a lack of capacity and infrastructure;\n",
        "8.  Agrees to follow a more realistic path than before and to make optimum use of limited capacities and stresses the importance of the efficient and innovative use of the various transport modes operating on their own or in multimodal integration; stresses that the development of co-modality should be in line with reducing the impact of transport on the environment; notes that each transport modes should develop on their own merits under corresponding environmental standards, carrying their own costs, thereby enhancing mobility by increased efficiency in all transport modes; stresses that co-modality enables an optimal and sustainable utilisation of resources to be reached by mobility management in transport logistics and by intermodal linkage of the various modes, which could decrease traffic, while getting surplus capacities to benefit the entire system;\n",
        "9.  Considers that rapid completion of the TEN-T network is the first way to create the conditions for better co-modality; notes that in different markets modal shift is essential for reducing the environmental impact of transport, and a modest modal shift can reduce road congestion; points out that shifts to more environmentally friendly modes, such as rail, bus and coach, maritime transport or inland navigation should be achieved, and emphasis should be put on those transport modes whose level of participation is still low, meaning that they have vast potential;\n",
        "10. While continuing the accomplishment of the TEN-T projects, points out that the conventional measures are reaching their limits; therefore emphasises the potential of intelligent transport systems, technological innovations, investments in telematics in order to enhance traffic efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve safety and environmental performance; points out that the benefits of intelligent systems and technological innovations (SESAR, ERTMS, RIS, Galileo, etc) should be realised; emphasises that the main task - both of the Community and of industry - is to support the market for new innovative solutions, and to create an appropriate legal and technical environment, including facilitated applications of the new technologies through public procurement;\n",
        "11. Notes that new challenges have emerged as a result of the globalisation of logistics, which is a key element for the competitiveness of the European economy; emphasises that European transport policy should integrate logistics with port development and integration and the development of logistics platforms; supports the development of a framework strategy for freight transport; encourages multimodal logistics solutions and the European modular system, infrastructure connections and advanced informatics; supports the development of a framework strategy for goods transport in Europe; considers that such a strategy must be based on the view that goods transport is fundamentally a purely business undertaking and that regulation should therefore be confined to the creation of an appropriate business environment for efficient goods transport;\n",
        "12. Stresses the need for co-operation and EU agreements with Third Countries individually and within international organisations in the field of transport, energy and environment and security; and expresses its wish to be substantially involved in these negotiations and agreements;\n",
        "13. Welcomes the plans of the Work Book for the forthcoming years:\n",
        "14. While the transport policy of the reunified Europe has faced and is still facing new challenges, emphasises that the Mid-term review of the Transport White Paper 2001 has not laid down long-term objectives nor given answers on an integrated approach to the future European transport policy; therefore calls on the Commission to immediately start work on a well-prepared European transport policy after 2010, which can meet the new challenges in a sustainable manner;\n",
        "15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
