        "1.  Recognises that the institutions, after the Council's first reading, have made the effort to reduce some of their usual expenditures in order to balance their absolute needs; considers that this exercise has contributed to setting-up a budget for the EU tax-payer as requested in the guidelines resolution; encourages warmly the institutions to pursue in this direction in order to strengthen citizens’ confidence in the European institutions and in Europe;\n",
        "2. Notes that most of the increase beyond the inflation rate is due to buildings’ expenditure; expresses its concern for the coming years regarding the weight of buildings related expenditure if not closely managed by the institutions; invites the institutions to keep the Budgetary Authority regularly informed of the evolution of their different projects with a medium term perspective and to control accordingly their expansion; requests that, in view of the entry into force in 2009 of the Members' Statute, an updated property investment plan for the coming 3 years including refurbishing costs should be submitted to the Budgetary Authority not later than 31 March 2008;\n",
        "3.    Has therefore decided to limit the budget increase of 2008 to 6,92 %; decides to leave a margin under the ceiling of heading 5; recommends restoring EUR 8 180 945 out of the EUR 22 127 359 reduction made by Council on the budget of the other institutions (excluding the Commission), that is restoring 37% following the examination of the specific requests and needs of each institution; considers that this approach responds to the institutions' needs for efficiency and safeguards the sustainability of their budgets;\n",
        "4.  Invites, in the context of a general concern vis-à-vis the environment, all institutions, including the Commission, to exploit the various possibilities, together with the host Member States, for achieving a more efficient public transport plan, including in-house mobility information points, intranet information on timetables and other incentives, in order to encourage the staff of the European institutions to use public transport or bicycles under safe conditions;\n",
        "5.  Acknowledges the efforts made by Parliament in the past 2 years to implement a redeployment exercise; regrets that many other institutions are not implementing an effective redeployment policy; expects these institutions to make redeployment an integral part of their budgetary exercise in the coming years;\n",
        "6.  Notes that in 2006 Parliament had requested from the other institutions more precise information on the performance and costs of their core tasks in order to justify in a more transparent manner the effectiveness or otherwise of additional funds; notes that very few institutions are providing this informative activity-related reporting; requests all the institutions in question to provide this information by the first week of September of each year; General comments\n",
        "7.  Recalls that 2008 is the last full year of this legislature and the last year before the entrance into force of the new Members’ Statute; considers that this should be taken into account in view of the forthcoming financing requirements;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes the fact that the Bureau has, for the first time, made new requests in its amending letter which are below the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of heading 5 (ie. at 19,87%) but include an increase of the estimates by EUR 45,6 million; takes note of the fact that the Bureau intends to launch a number of new projects which are not directly linked to Parliament’s core activities; considers that in view of the lack of flexibility which exists in the administrative budget, the development of new projects should be undertaken in a prudent way taking into account the limited availability of financial resources and the perspectives from 2009 onwards; encourages the administration and the Bureau to reflect on the real needs and on the institution in administrative and political terms and to seek means to reduce the current costs of the tasks undertaken; reiterates that the above does not constitute any limitation on Parliament's right to make full use of the 20% ceiling in 2008 and subsequent years, should it be deemed necessary and justifiable to do so;\n",
        "9.  Suggests that a broad discussion on the history of Europe and its interpretation take place at expert level before creating the House of European History;\n",
        "10. Welcomes the new redeployment plan proposed by the Secretary General which concerns 58 posts; considers that it constitutes a step in the right direction in fulfilling the new needs and at the same time in keeping the establishment plan stable in the future; encourages the Secretary-General to pursue this action and to proceed to further analysis in order to better rationalise the tasks and at the same time keep the costs of externalisation under control;\n",
        "11. Decides, in line with its abovementioned resolution of 7 June 2007 on Parliament's estimates for 2008, to reduce a number of budget lines, especially those that proved to be inflated in 2006; notes that chapters 10 and 12 and title 4 are not affected by these reductions;\n",
        "12.  Acknowledges that new projects have been presented at a late stage and have impeded plenary's decision to remain at inflation rate except when new initiatives were duly substantiated; has decided to set the final level of the Parliament’s budget at EUR XX corresponding to a XX% increase over the 2007 budget and XX% of heading 5;\n",
        "13. Confirms its commitment to better law making as a priority for Parliament's core activities and supports the decisions undertaken in this direction; encourages the Secretary General to continue his efforts in order to strengthen Parliament's expertise in better law making; Enhancing Members’ assistance\n",
        "14.  Considers that preserving the linguistic diversity of Members of the European Parliament is one of the most important challenges for the administration; welcomes, in that context, the pilot project scheduled to be launched in 2008 to respond to Members’ recurrent demands for linguistic assistance both at an individual level and during non-official meetings linked to the legislative work;\n",
        "15.  Decides therefore to limit the global allocation for the pilot project to EUR 4 million and, at the same time, to place EUR 2 million in the reserve in order to induce the administration to give priority to more efficient linguistic support for Members during official meetings; this reserve of EUR 2 million does not affect the pilot project;\n",
        "16.  Reiterates that the most efficient use should be made of the interpretation service and the expenses related to meetings; considers that equipping all meeting rooms with the electronic voting system constitutes a way to improve the use the interpretation facilities;\n",

        "19.  Takes note of the proposal to create a new article 323 for the \"relations with Parliaments of third countries and support for parliamentary democracy\" with an amount of EUR 360 000 to differentiate, by geographical area, the Parliament's activities; expresses its concern regarding the number of delegations and assemblies in the Parliament's budget in particular due to the fact that their financial impact is not clearly identified in the budget as it includes not only the appropriation under the existing items but also the related costs for interpretation and technical and logistical support; asks the administration to make a proposal to improve the transparency of this type of activity;\n",
        "20.  Considers that the Presidencies of the Parliament and the Council should take into account EU citizens' opinion as regards the geographical dispersion of the Parliament amongst the three places of work and the related costs and environmental consequences; invites the two Presidencies to negotiate while retaining the important symbolic value of  Strasbourg, to bring up a proposal to hold plenary sittings there twice a year in order to respond to citizens' concerns in terms of savings and environment;\n",

        "22. Calls on the Commission to present a new proposal for an assistants' statute that guarantees the necessary freedom of choice and flexibility for Members in terms of duration of contracts and salaries on the one hand and uniformity and security in terms of the tax regime, social security provisions and medical insurance for assistants on the other hand; European Political Foundations\n",

        "28.  Reiterates its willingness to have a strong information policy involving the political groups and close to the European citizens; considers that this can be achieved through the strengthening of the local and regional media, the quick opening of the Visitors' Centre in Brussels and the increased flexibility of the use of the visitors' groups; regarding the latter, recalls that reimbursement based on real costs, within a ceiling to be defined, will ensure the complete transparency of the programme; invites, to that end, the Quaestors to re-examine the current rules;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Bureau to decide on a programme for the forthcoming election campaign that takes into account the need for close contact between Members and EU citizens; reiterates in this respect the role of the Information Offices as well as the local and regional media, as regards increasing EU citizens' awareness of Parliament's activities; asks the administration to strengthen actions in favour of local and regional media in the external offices, including the involvement of Members; looks forward in this connection to receiving their annual work programme for 2008 by December 2007 in order to release the reserve in January;\n",
