{"speaker": "Richard James Ashworth,", "english": "Richard James Ashworth, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr Virrankoski for an excellent report and for the substantial amount of work he has done on it.\nHe rightly says that 2008 is year two in a seven-year financial perspective. It is my belief that this budget is moving in the right direction to offer value for money and with payment appropriations this year set at 0.99% GNI, it has the potential to achieve far better implementation in the coming years.\nHowever, in order to achieve these goals, I call on the Council, in particular, to take note of Parliament’s views and to be prepared to discuss some of the issues further, and I mention four issues at this point.\nFirstly, Galileo and the European Institute of Technology (EIT): Parliament has given its approval to these schemes, but we still need evidence of budgetary discipline from the other institutions, and I make here three points. Firstly, I see insufficient evidence of provision for cost over-runs and late delivery of the projects. Secondly, I see insufficient evidence of very clear lines of accountability and responsibility with these major items, particularly where contracts for work on the projects are being awarded. Finally, I believe that the Commission should do far more to share its vision for the Galileo project and particularly the post-development phase of the project and the on-going situation.\nSecondly, under Heading 4, we already know that demand for funding for Palestine and Kosovo will extend the margin under this heading quite considerably. This in part has been met by a reduction in funding for the CFSP. But that will inevitably create problems during the next year and I think that some time after Parliament’s first reading we will need to have discussions with the Council and the Commission to see how we can address that situation.\nThirdly, I call on the Council to support Parliament’s efforts to oblige the Commission to comply with the screening exercise and to achieve greater efficiency in staffing levels. This includes the decentralised and external agencies, where I fear there is need for far greater levels of accountability.\nFinally, it is most important that both the Council and the Commission attach far greater urgency to the achievement of a positive déclaration d’assurance from the Court of Auditors. In my view, their current rate of progress is unacceptably slow and, in consequence of this, the credibility of this House is seriously undermined. I therefore call on the Council, in particular, to show far greater urgency to address this situation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard James Ashworth, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr Virrankoski for an excellent report and for the substantial amount of work he has done on it.\nHe rightly says that 2008 is year two in a seven-year financial perspective.
