{"speaker": "Peter Šťastný (PPE-DE),", "english": "Peter Šťastný (PPE-DE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä for a splendid, yet thankless, job.\nI believe it is important to underline not only the role of Parliament as the Institution with oversight over the budget, but also the role of each individual committee in regard to aspects of the budget directly under their sphere of competencies. I think it is very healthy that individual DGs report to the various committees on their expected expenses for a given year. There has to be a level of control and there has to be transparency. Although the Committee on International Trade does not have a codecision in trade matters – yet – I think it is a very good practice that has developed in which we have a frank and open discussion with DG Trade on budgetary matters and why certain expenses are needed.\nIn terms of budgetary lines, I want to emphasise the need to maintain both aid for trade as well as the parliamentary dimension of WTO as important aspects of a trade budget. We need to be able to promote European goods in third countries. We need to have experts who help our companies to enter foreign markets but, at the same time, we need to help developing countries export to the EU. Without trade there is no long-term sustainable development. The WTO has been criticised recently for its lack of transparency. The parliamentary dimension of world trade talks is an important initiative we should continue to support because it improves dialogue, gives greater legitimacy and allows for greater oversight.\nOn a final note, I urge the Commission to make sure that Parliament is informed in due course of any projects of microfinancial assistance so that a proper debate can be held in the relevant committees, and that we as an institution are well aware of beneficiary countries spending EU money.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Šťastný (PPE-DE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade . – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä for a splendid, yet thankless, job.\nI believe it is important to underline not only the role of Parliament as the Institution with oversight over the budget, but also the role of each individual committee in regard to aspects of the budget directly under their sphere of competencies.
