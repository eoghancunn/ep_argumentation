{"speaker": "James Elles (PPE-DE). –", "english": "James Elles (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, as others have done. However, in my remarks, instead of the three ‘L’s used by Mr Martinez, which if I remember correctly were ‘litany’, ‘liturgy’ and ‘lethargy’, I would rather use three ‘I’s, which are ‘implementation’, ‘initiation’ and ‘imagination’.\nFirstly, I should like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Virrankoski, for including a couple of paragraphs about the monitoring of the budget. It is extremely important that we think about the question of value for money. Even if that particular term is not included in the resolution, it is, no doubt, in the hearts of everybody that we need to be able to justify, with our specialised committees, the monies we are actually spending, not just in the current period, but also in the fact of having the national management declarations, which it seems many Member States are still reluctant to put together.\nSecondly, I would like to thank both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner, in this regard, for having, in my own budget for the year 2007, implemented those pilot projects and preparatory projects which were included. There are quite a few of them, and it is nice to have a certain continuity as we go through into 2008, particularly picking up on the pilot information networks, but also on the projects with the EU, China and India.\nThat brings me to my last point, which is the question of imagination. Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge. We have seen in this debate that many colleagues – Mr Mantovani, Ms Guy-Quint and others – and myself always deplore the fact that we have too little money in category four, the external actions. We know perfectly well there is too little, so I would put in a particular plea at this stage, as we look towards the budget review, that maybe we should actually use a little imagination to see how the European Union will be called upon in the future to meet the global challenges of the future and to play its part in global assistance and the functioning of the global economy, and then make sure we have the means to be able to implement what we wish to take on as our policies.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Elles (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, as others have done.
