We are establishing a new energy research agenda for Europe, which is much needed in view of the challenges we shall be facing in the next decade.\nThe Commission believes that Europe should lower the costs of clean energy and put industry at the forefront of the low-carbon technology sector. While I agree with these objectives, I would also say that the best intentions never become reality without proper financing. This is why I regret that the Commission did not publish the communication on financing for new low-carbon technologies. How does the Commission intend to finance these actions? In any case, let me assure you that Parliament will not accept the reallocation of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme or the CAP.\nThis question of financing is also raised in regard to the 12 CCS projects. While I believe this technology might help industry to reduce CO 2 emissions, I cannot accept that European taxpayers’ money be used to finance the development of a CCS infrastructure that will be someone’s business in the end. As a Liberal, I believe we have to let the market function and develop, if needed, a fair partnership with the industry.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Adina-Ioana Vălean (ALDE). – Mr President, as shadow rapporteur on the SET Plan, I warmly welcome this initiative.
