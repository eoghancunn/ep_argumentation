{"speaker": "Jerzy Buzek,", "english": "Jerzy Buzek, rapporteur . − Madam President, I thank all my colleagues for the discussion – it was a very good, very deep discussion – especially the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues who prepared opinions in other committees. I congratulate both rapporteurs, Mr Paparizov and Mr La Russa. I entirely support your reports – and of course I support my report as well, but I am probably not very objective on that.\nAs you can see from the discussion there is not much controversy on the SET Plan, but there is one thing on which I should like an answer. Adina-Ioana Vălean is not in favour of the CCS installations – the CCS commercial demonstration installations – because the companies we would like to support are doing business.\nI would like to give an example. The same companies receive enormous incentives from citizens’ taxes for renewables. There are also commercial renewable installations and companies are doing business – nothing else – and I very strongly support these incentives for renewables. If you really want to solve the climate change problem on our planet we must solve the CCS question because we do not know the true answer for that. So from that point of view, as in the case of renewables, we should also have incentives for the first movers on CCS.\nI give my thanks and congratulations to both Commissioners. You are doing great work on the energy issue, as well as on R&D and innovation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jerzy Buzek, rapporteur . − Madam President, I thank all my colleagues for the discussion – it was a very good, very deep discussion – especially the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues who prepared opinions in other committees.
