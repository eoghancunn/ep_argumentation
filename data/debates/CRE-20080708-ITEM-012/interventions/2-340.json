It is equally important that other trading blocks around the world sign up to similar commitments in the near future. However, fuel prices are now the more serious concern for the citizens of European countries. The European Union must put in place innovative policies to help stem the rise of oil prices. Increasing oil production is a key element of this process.\nMr President, there is clear uncertainty in the international financial markets at present. Many speculators have switched their investment strategies into the commodities market and this speculation has contributed to increasing pressure on oil prices in an upward spiral. Rising oil prices is the last thing that European business and consumers need at a time of increasing economic difficulties. The European Union needs to have a progressive neighbourhood policy in place which will ensure that we can protect and secure our energy needs into the future.", "lang": "GA", "original": "Liam Aylward (UEN). – (GA) Mr President, investing in new and cleaner technologies must be a central element of EU strategies to ensure that we can reach the EU target of 25% of energy supplies coming from the renewable sector.
