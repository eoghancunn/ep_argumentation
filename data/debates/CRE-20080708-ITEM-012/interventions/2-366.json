Again I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Buzek, Mr La Russa and Mr Paparizov, for developing such a type of consensus. We know that we are looking for secure, sustainable and affordable energy supplies and at the same time we also now realise that the change in the energy sector came a bit earlier than everybody anticipated. That requires us to take much faster action and to be more determined.\nI would mention one particular synergy that I have seen and that is very relevant. Yesterday I visited the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, not very far from Strasbourg, in Stuttgart. They have a research project on how to increase the efficiency of energy supply, combining the cycle of gas turbines and fuel cells, so in a way trying to rely on existing energy sources and increasing their efficiency with new technology. They are advancing reasonably well but there are a lot of technical challenges. To really move ahead we need more support for such a type of project. But, at the same time, we also understand that, if there is no competition in the market, these projects will always stay in laboratories. So we need to act in both ways to continue.\nFor the internal market package, I believe that now, after the vote, it is very necessary for all three institutions to move ahead rapidly to wrap this thing up and go on to the implementation stage.\nThe Commission is committed to really doing everything to find a fast compromise in the second reading and to get the package agreed.\nConcerning the strategic energy review: it is at the start of the process. The technology plan is only the starting point. We will still need a lot of measures to really move ahead. One of the measures that I have promised to my colleagues and also here in Parliament is a communication on the financing of low-carbon energy sources, but this is not the only one. We believe that there are a lot of other measures needed if we are to really move ahead. Very wise words were said at the time of the first oil crisis. We do not have too much oil but we have ideas.\nI believe – at least this is my opinion and it was said in the debate – we really need to use the ideas that we have. We do not have too much oil left in the soil in the European Union.\nCommission’s position on amendments by Parliament\nPaparizov report ( A6-0253/2008 )\nThe Commission can accept the following amendments: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 25, 31, 39, 41, 43, 44.\nThe Commission can partially accept the following amendments: 1, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 53.\nThe Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 4, 7, 13, 15, 23, 28, 40, 42, 45, 48, 52, 54.\nLa Russa report ( A6-0257/2008 )\nThe Commission can accept the following amendments: 2, 3, 7, 16, 20, 24, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 40, 44, 50, 56, 60, 64, 73, 74, 87, 92, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 112, 120, 122, 124, 136, 140, 142.\nThe Commission can partially accept the following amendments: 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 45, 46, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 61, 63, 64, 68, 69, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 84, 85, 86, 88, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 104, 107, 111, 115, 117, 118, 119, 125, 127, 132, 135, 138, 139, 141, 143.\nThe Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 4, 10, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 30, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 47, 54, 57, 58, 59, 62, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 79, 82, 83, 89, 90, 97, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 113, 114, 116, 121, 123, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 137, 144, 145.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Andris Piebalgs, Member of the Commission . − Mr President, it is very clear that there is very strong convergence of views on the three reports.
