In the gas sector our dependency on imports is as high as 60% and, according to some estimates, by 2030 this dependency will be 80%. From Russia alone we import 40% of total gas imports, and some Member Countries import all their gas, which means their dependency on imports is 100%. For this very reason it is extremely important that we should take care to ensure that an integrated Europe is a competent and an equal partner to Russia.\nWith liberalisation in the energy sector, we are introducing several independent protagonists. Given that in Europe securing a critical mass of well-trained labour is now already a considerable challenge, due to a further liberalisation will be even more difficult to secure experts in the future. This particularly applies to smaller Member States with relatively insubstantial power-generating undertakings. An additional challenge in this respect is to maintain the political responsibility for welfare within a country despite the changes on the European energy markets.\nA well-trained labour force is also required in order to make use of the opportunities available within the SET programme. During the last four years alone we have adopted a number of mechanisms for the promotion of research and development in the energy sector. I therefore expect that the Commission will dedicate special attention to the harmonisation of various contracts.\nLadies and gentlemen, the Slovenian Presidency has made considerable endeavours to promote the third market liberalisation package. I hope that the French Presidency will continue the work with the same conviction.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Romana Jordan Cizelj (PPE-DE). – ( SL ) In the area of energy we face at least three challenges: the environmental challenge, the challenge of ensuring that the European economy is competitive, and the challenge of securing a regular energy supply.\nThe essential condition and a necessary requirement for responding to these challenges is that the players operate on a transparent internal market and under uniform rules.\nThere is, of course, a difference between the electrical energy sector and the gas sector.
