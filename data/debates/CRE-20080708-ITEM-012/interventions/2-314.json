{"speaker": "Jerzy Buzek,", "english": "Jerzy Buzek, rapporteur . − Mr President, I was rather surprised when I read that both the SET Plan and our energy package were going to be in the same programme as a block. It is as if one were to talk about human rights and human diseases in a block because they are both ‘human’, which is not a very good idea. Similarly, the fact that they are both about ‘energy’ is not enough to link energy technology and the energy package together as they are very different topics.\nBut seeing both Commissioners here, I am very glad at this decision, because the SET Plan is very important for the European Union and needs strong support from some Commissioners and from the whole Commission. As you can see from the voting in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, you have support from the European Parliament.\nI will now go through the content of the SET plan. However, it would probably be easier if I change to my mother tongue, which I shall now do.\n(PL) The European Union has decided to make a charge for emissions of carbon dioxide. This is a key decision. We are showing that we shall fight climate change. We are showing that we are a leader in this battle. On the other hand, we should remember that charges on carbon dioxide emissions create difficulties for the economy and result in higher production costs in almost every sector. I would like to emphasise that the energy sector itself will be hardest hit, particularly in countries where electricity or heat are generated using coal.\nThe proposal put forward by the European Commission concerning a strategic energy technology programme is, in my opinion, an excellent response to the threats to the European economy. It is all about reducing energy costs. The European Commission has introduced support for zero and low-emission technologies in ‘energy, production and energy processing’. For the first time we have all the methods for combating climate change and for energy security presented in one document. This means that nuclear power is also included. In fact, the continuing concerns of our colleagues, principally our colleagues from the Green Party, all the risks associated with nuclear power generation, are presented by them. However, today, the third generation of nuclear power stations is completely different from what was built in Chernobyl.\nIt seems that there is full agreement as regards another great challenge and issue, namely the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. This is a new technology, so incentives are essential, as for any new and promising technology. As regards support for sustainable technologies in the power generation sector, this was never in doubt in Parliament. Parliament treats energy efficiency and energy saving as the most important issue. Perhaps as a result of this it will be possible to avoid building one or two nuclear power stations, because we will improve efficiency and energy saving.\nI would like to end by mentioning two points. The organisation of research at European level is an excellent idea and we are in favour of it. This could be the first sector in which the European Union does this. It is the start of a common energy market, in this area also, as well as the free movement of knowledge. In this report I proposed specific amounts of funding to support new technologies. This is essential if we want to help our industry, the energy sector, and if we want to make the Lisbon Strategy a success.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jerzy Buzek, rapporteur . − Mr President, I was rather surprised when I read that both the SET Plan and our energy package were going to be in the same programme as a block.
