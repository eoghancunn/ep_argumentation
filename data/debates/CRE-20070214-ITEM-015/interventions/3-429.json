{"speaker": "James Nicholson (PPE-DE). –", "english": "James Nicholson (PPE-DE). – Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report, which continues the efforts of this Parliament to address the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\nThe European Union’s 2002 Action Plan to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing includes four actions to be implemented at Community level. One of these is to define the responsibility of Member States to prevent their nationals from engaging in IUU fishing. Indeed, the related Council Regulation of 2002 requires Member States to take action against nationals that infringe the common fisheries policy.\nWe seem to be very efficient in tracking and taking action against our own fishermen for any transgression of European law, while we seem at the same time to have been rather less efficient at dealing with the much bigger problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The problem of overfishing and illegal fishing is international. It goes beyond the European Union waters, and yet the fishermen that I represent can with some justice complain that the Commission sometimes cannot see beyond our own waters.\nThere is clearly a lot still to be achieved to deal with this problem and I welcome the practical proposals such as the suggestion that vessels bringing fish into the European Union should be subject to the same documentation delivery requirement as vessels operating within the European Union. Likewise I welcome the suggestion that the Commission should engage with developing countries to give them assistance in dealing with IUU fishing. I understand that one of the vehicles for achieving this is through the various bilateral fisheries agreements with developing countries.\nHowever, I would like to be sure that this represents a joined-up approach to the problem and that it is not merely ad hoc. I note that some countries have not been cooperative. Surely if we are making bilateral fisheries agreements with a country, we can force a higher degree of cooperation from them. Otherwise cynics might suggest that we are more interested in getting the fish than stopping illegal fishing.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Nicholson (PPE-DE). – Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report, which continues the efforts of this Parliament to address the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\nThe European Union’s 2002 Action Plan to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing includes four actions to be implemented at Community level.
