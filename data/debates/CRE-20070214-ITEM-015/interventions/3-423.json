{"speaker": "Elspeth Attwooll,", "english": "Elspeth Attwooll, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President. I want to begin by complimenting Marie-Hélène Aubert on the quality of her report. Her explanatory statement contains an excellent analysis of the problem and of the extent of progress made in relation to the EU Action Plan of 2002. It makes ten very clear recommendations for a new Action Plan to start in 2007. Five of these recommendations involve internal measures and five involve cooperation with other countries, both directly and through the medium of regional fisheries management organisations.\nCentral to the issue of combating IUU fishing are improvements in traceability, both of vessels and of the fish that they catch or transport. This includes, amongst other things, insisting on the use of FAO identification standards for EU vessels and those entering EU ports, and on the development of proper catch documentation schemes. But it also means better exchange of information between the parties concerned, so that blacklists of both fishing and fish transport vessels can be disseminated and the possibility of converting to a white list through reflagging can be avoided. The establishment of blacklists is, however, only effective if there are serious consequences for the vessels concerned. That is why we urge the Commission to take very seriously the recommendation in paragraph 18 of the resolution that consideration be given to extending the import controls relating to health and hygiene to cover the products of IUU fishing as well. For this reason, the revival of the inter-services consultation group is particularly welcome.\nOf course, there are many other steps that could be taken, which is why we are asking for the fight against illegal fishing to be one of the priorities of the annual work programme of the Community Fisheries Control Agency. In this context too, we must be sure that our own house is fully in order, which is why we repeat Parliament’s previous requests for common minimum penalties for serious infringements to be made applicable across all the Member States. Equal treatment is a major factor in encouraging compliance.\nThe importance of assisting developing countries to monitor fishing activities in their own waters must also be stressed. There is an additional responsibility in this regard where we have concluded fisheries partnership agreements with them. The inclusion of IUU fishing in the Commission’s work programme for this year is very welcome, but we need a clear timetable in this regard. It is good to hear that the Commission will be presenting something to Parliament in the second half of the year, but we hope that it will be sooner rather than later, and comprehensive in its coverage.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elspeth Attwooll, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President.
