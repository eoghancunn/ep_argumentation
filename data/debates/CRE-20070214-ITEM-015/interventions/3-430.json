{"speaker": "David Casa (PPE-DE). –", "english": "David Casa (PPE-DE). – Madam President, many of our debates regarding fisheries have been centred around sustainability and the importance of finding the right equilibrium between the protection of the marine environment, the protection of fish stock and the viability of the activity.\nRegulations have been set up and fishermen are obliged to abide by these regulations so that an optimum standard is achieved, a standard that would be beneficial to everyone. These regulations have been based on specific statistics gathered from our seas and standards have been set on this information. However, I feel that, unless we tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing with an iron fist, we would be doing a disservice to honest fishermen and restricting their activity to the benefit of others acting illegally.\nThe line between legal and illicit fishing is sometimes very fine and we need to have a clear-cut definition in this regard in order to avoid misunderstanding. We need an effective control system and a management programme that will be more coherent and specific so as to apply the existing regulations with more accuracy. We must also try to negotiate with our neighbouring states in order to adopt the same policies so that we would have a one-sea, one-policy system, which undoubtedly would be beneficial to all. In order to do this, we must be willing to share our technology with these countries and encourage new partnership agreements.\nFurther to this, cooperation between us, the Member States, has to be strengthened. Proof of the legal origin of fish catches should be compulsory before any content is offloaded in the EU. This should include documents that show that fish have been caught in accordance with RFMO rules. This will be a very important stepping stone in ensuring that our fishermen get the right dues, and that, furthermore, our seas are protected from overfishing. When stocks were plentiful, we would often turn a blind eye to unregulated activity. Now, I think, is the time to act before it is too late. No regulation and no law will ever be effective or have any meaning if overfishing renders our seas barren.", "lang": "EN", "original": "David Casa (PPE-DE). – Madam President, many of our debates regarding fisheries have been centred around sustainability and the importance of finding the right equilibrium between the protection of the marine environment, the protection of fish stock and the viability of the activity.\nRegulations have been set up and fishermen are obliged to abide by these regulations so that an optimum standard is achieved, a standard that would be beneficial to everyone.
