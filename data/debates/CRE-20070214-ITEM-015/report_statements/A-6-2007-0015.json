    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Reiterates its commitment to combating IUU fishing in all its forms, as expressed in its resolution of 20 November 2002, referred to above;\n",
        "2.  Welcomes the progress that has been made at the international level and by the EU in combating IUU fishing, but considers that the phenomenon continues to escalate and, consequently, that further efforts are needed;\n",
        "3.  Considers that the extent of IUU fishing, the diversity of factors contributing to it and the wide range of legal, logistical and financial tools necessary to combat it are such as to require cooperation at all levels, including the various Directorates-General of the Commission (especially, but not limited to, the Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Trade, Development and Health and Consumer Protection DGs), the Council, the individual Member States and the international community; takes the view, to that end, that the Green Paper on a new maritime policy for the Union could serve as a framework for cooperation on the basis of which the fight against IUU fishing might be approached more effectively;\n",
        "4.  Considers that the importance of the European Union in the world, in its various roles as a major fishing power and as the world's largest market for fish, obliges it to be at the forefront of the fight against IUU fishing;\n",
        "5.  Notes that the EU is among the world's wealthiest and most technologically advanced entities and that it bases itself on the rule of law, all of which behoves the EU to broaden and intensify its efforts to combat IUU fishing;\n",
        "6.  Considers that the EU can only act credibly on the world scene if it has already taken effective action to halt its own involvement in IUU fishing, both in EU waters and by EU vessels or interests outside the EU;\n",
        "7.  Urges the Commission to help developing countries, above all those with which it has fishing agreements, to comply fully with the commitments of the abovementioned international plan of action designed to prevent illegal fishing, helping to strengthen the scant means available to them by including specific actions in the new partnership agreements;\n",
        "8.  Reiterates its conviction that a crucial and obvious first step for the European Union to take is, first, to fully implement the existing provisions of the CFP and other relevant Community legislation in an effective, fair and rigorous manner, in order to reduce unreported and illegal fishing by Community vessels and in Community waters and,second, to prevent the landing and marketing of products from illegally caught fish from outside the EU; notes that these duties fallprimarily on the governments of the Member States, in applicationof Community law and as port states;\n",
        "9.  Urges the Commission and the Member States to strengthen deterrence mechanisms (surveillance, control, sanctions, etc.) and to propose measures that will make it possible to prevent infringements and improve the application of existing rules;\n",
        "10. Notes that poor traceability of fish leads to confusion over its origin, making it difficult or impossible to distinguish between legally caught fish and illegally caught fish;\n",
        "11. Considers it necessary to improve assistance and cooperation among the Member States in order to strengthen controls and surveillance and to promote commercial regulation measures that will make it possible to identify the origin of catches landed;\n",
        "12. Considers it necessary to intensify port state control of landings and transhipments of frozen fish from third countries and to improve cooperation between the Member States and those countries;\n",
        "13. Recalls its resolution of 7 September 2006 on eco-labelling, referred to above, and reiterates its belief that the improvements in the traceability of fish, from the net to the plate, that would be required by eco-labelling schemes would be of considerable help in identifying IUU fish and keeping it off the EU market; calls on the Commission to present its proposal on eco-labelling by June 2007;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to redouble their efforts to implement the 15 actions included in the EU action plan on IUU fishing as agreed in 2002, and in particular to: i.     guarantee equal treatment for economic players, discouraging those within the Community who wish to use flags of convenience; ii.    incorporate rules in Community legislation to ban trade in IUU-origin fish; iii.   put in place binding rules on control and inspection within a common legal framework across the European Union; iv.   expand the Community information campaign so as to improve public awareness of the extent and serious nature of IUU fishing; v.    promote detailed control and inspection plans for each RFMO to which the EU belongs; vi.   work to ensure that coverage by RFMOs is extended to include all major fisheries in the world's oceans, including demersal species, small pelagic species and highly migratory species; vii.  contribute actively to the creation and revision, as appropriate, of lists adopted by RFMOs of vessels that undermine conservation measures, including by providing sightings; encourage the implementation of trade sanctions against countries whose flag those vessels fly; viii. promote the adoption of uniform action plans by RFMOs by pushing for the most effective measures possible; ix.   work actively to promote the development of catch documentation schemes, starting with the most endangered species, and ensure that fishallowed onto the EU market has not been caught illegally; x.    strengthen international cooperation in the MCS (Monitoring, Control and Surveillance) network as well as regional schemes with a view to the establishment, under the auspices of the FAO, of an international information system on offshore fishing vessels; xi.   define a \"substantial link\" between a fishing vessel and the flag she flies; xii.  define the rights and obligations of port States; xiii. assist developing countries in their ability to monitor fishing activities in their waters and to combat IUU fishing;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the inclusion in the Commission's work programme for 2007 of a package on IUU fishing, including a communication from the Commission and a proposal for a Council regulation on stepping up the fight against IUU fishing; welcomes the revival of the Commission's inter-service consultation group, which was originally set up in 2002;\n",
        "16. Calls on the Community Fisheries Control Agency to include the fight against illegal fishing and coordination of Member States' activity in this field among its priorities as part of its annual work programme;\n",
        "17. Calls on all those interested in eliminating IUU fishing, including all EU institutions, the governments of the Member States, the various segments of the fishing, processing and retail industry, NGOs and other concerned parties to present their proposals on what the EU should do during the discussion to be launched by the Commission with its upcoming communication on IUU fishing;\n",
        "18. Considers that the Commission should include the following actions in its proposal to be adopted in EU law: ·all fishing vessels and fish transport vessels registered in the EU or flying the flags of third countries and wishing to enter an EU port must be readily identifiable by means of the markings included in the FAO's Standard Specifications for the Marking and Identification of Fishing Vessels; ·a Community register of vessels engaging in IUU fishing must be created which would include vessels on RFMO blacklists; such a register will facilitate the swift exchange of information among the Member States and make it possible to monitor vessels taking account of possible re-flagging; ·common minimum penalties for serious infringements must be applicable in all Member States, and must be sufficiently dissuasive; ·Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy[5]and Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products[6]must be strengthened in such a way as to provide for fish to be fully traceable from the time it is brought aboard a fishing vessel until it reaches its final customer; ·all black lists of fishing vessels and fish transport vessels, including their owners or operators, adopted by RFMOs must be published and incorporated directly into Community law; non-EU vessels on those lists must be prohibited from entry into Community ports for any purpose, except in cases of force majeure or for humanitarian reasons; all EU-flagged vessels must be prohibited from providing support (fuel, supplies, transhipment, etc.) to those vessels while at sea; ·the legal origin of fish must be demonstrated before it is allowed to be offloaded in EU ports or imported into the EU; such proof must include, for both landings from fishing vessels and transshipments:\n",
        "19. Welcomes the establishment of the new control agency and is confident that the agency will play an important role in the fight against IUU fishing; calls upon the Commission to consider the idea of the establishment of an EU coastguard;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to prevent fishing in Community waters and entry to Community ports by vessels which are involved in IUU fishing in accordance with the rules in force and to prohibit the importing of fish from those vessels; calls, likewise, on the Member States not to allow this type of vessel to be flagged under their flag, and to invite importers, transporters and other sectors concerned not to tranship or deal with fish caught by those vessels;\n",
        "21. Urges the Commission to ensure that any natural or legal persons guilty of IUU fishing in accordance with the rules in force do not receive any type of aid or subsidy from Community funds for any branch of their activities, and to ask the Member States to take similar action with regard to their respective national aid;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission to carry out and present a study on tariffs and rules of origin, containing an examination of the ways in which these tools may be used in order to encourage third countries to ensure that their vessels abide by relevant international management measures;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to carry out and submit a study on compliance with Community labour, health and safety legislation and on respect for the social rights of workers on that type of vessel, and on their living and working conditions on board;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission to use its considerable influence in RFMOs to encourage them to establish lists of vessels that are authorised to fish (white lists) and of vessels that have been caught fishing illegally (black lists); such lists must be drawn up in a transparent and coherent manner in accordance with clear criteria; also calls on the Commission to encourage RFMOs to identify countries which do not control the activities of vessels flying their flag and to use those lists as tools to allow the acceptance or rejection of fish;\n",
        "25. Urges the Commission to continue giving maximum priority to cooperation with RFMOs such as the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which, with their initiatives designed to combat illegal fishing, have proved to be the most suitable instruments for ensuring good governance on the high seas;\n",
        "26. Urges the Commission and the Council to strengthen the resources allocated to the fight against corruption and organised crime at all levels;\n",
        "27. Is convinced that the keys to reducing and eliminating IUU fishing are full traceability all along the chain of custody, transparency of decisions, cooperation within the EU and the wider international community and, most importantly, a demonstration of political will by all parties; reiterates that, unless much more is done, fish stocks will continue to be depleted and fishing communities in the EU and elsewhere will suffer even greater hardship;\n",
        "28. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Committee on Fisheries of the FAO and the secretariats of the RFMOs to which the EU belongs.\n"
