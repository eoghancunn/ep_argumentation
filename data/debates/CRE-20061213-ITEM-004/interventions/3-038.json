When speaking of a revised Constitution, he calls for the adoption of a clause enabling Member States to withdraw from the European Union. Eventually, Britain will leave the European Union, Constitution or not, withdrawal clause or not, but at least Mr Stubb has the decency to recognise that countries should have the right to secede from the new European empire.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gerard Batten (IND/DEM). – Mr President, the European Union has a seemingly limitless need to absorb more countries.
