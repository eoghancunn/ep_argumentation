I am very much pro-enlargement because I believe it has been successful and will continue to be. But I am also against the Constitution.\nThe concept of integration capacity is, potentially, one that will be used to sell or portray the Constitution as simply a matter of tweaking the institutions to allow for enlargement in practice. That would not only be a misrepresentation of that text, but would represent a real failure on our part in terms of what we keep talking about: communication with the citizens of the EU. To communicate, we must listen, and we must have that very fundamental debate on the direction of the Union. Where citizens see public services and workers’ rights undermined, there is no good way of communicating that, so we need to be receptive.\nFinally, on the issue of Turkey, I support accession, but the issue of Cyprus must be sorted out. This is a matter of a continuing illegal occupation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mary Lou McDonald (GUE/NGL). – Mr President, I welcome this debate and would like to make a few brief points.\nMr Stubb identified different classifications of people and politics on this issue of enlargement and the Constitution.
