Rain is a gift from God that must be managed in a responsible manner. We must not flush a gift from God down the drain. We must use it to nourish the ground, to bring forth new life.\nEvery year, more than 20 billion m 3 of rainwater are drained away from European cities through sewers and drainage pipes into the seas and oceans. This is the real reason why the European continent is drying out because rainwater, in all its forms, is the source of all water resources on the continents.\nI welcome the involvement of the rapporteur, Mr Richard Seeber, in seeking solutions to the problems of water scarcity and droughts in the EU. However, I expected the report to be slightly more ambitious. Only in paragraph 48, which found its way into the report thanks to my suggestion in the Committee on Regional Development, does the report mention the need for rainwater collection, and even then it does so only marginally.\nI believe that the new water paradigm, developed by the team of Slovak and Czech scientists led by Mr Michal Kravčík, will also influence our rapporteur and in the future will change the EU Water Framework Directive. As far as I am aware, Commissioner Špidla has also expressed his support for this suggestion and this programme.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zita Pleštinská (PPE-DE). - (SK) Water is life.
