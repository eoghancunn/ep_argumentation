{"speaker": "Péter Olajos,", "english": "Péter Olajos, on behalf of the PPE-DE group . – ( HU ) Thank you, Mr President. I would first like to add to my colleagues’ praise of Mr Seeber. He has brought expertise and hard work to this task and well deserves success and praise. This, I must say, is an extremely important matter. Ninety per cent of Hungary, my country, is a land threatened by drought. The regular occurrences of drought in past few years have caused exceptional damage to Hungarian agriculture, with the damage last year alone amounting to one billion euros. Drought is a problem that is not restricted to the countries in the south. It has caused huge problems in Hungary even though Europe’s largest river, the Danube, and the seventh largest, the Tisza, both flow across it. Even so, the hundred-kilometre-wide area lying between these two abundant rivers has begun to suffer from desertification and this process is happening and being made to happen ever faster. This demonstrates that the European Union needs an overarching water management programme and I would therefore like to welcome this report, showing that the European Union has resolved to take action in the fight to control desertification and in the interests of that fight.\nYesterday, the Committee on Budgets, on my proposal, supported a pilot project calling for assistance in the control of desertification. But we must all contribute more in support of efficient agriculture practices and overarching water management. The measures we have to take to rationalise the use of water by the general population are important too. As a result of climate change the effects of regular periods of water scarcity will probably become more pronounced and every single drop of evaporated water will have a consequence.\nFinally, permit me to draw your attention to the question of global responsibility. As the population of the world continues to grow dynamically, with even more pressure on industry, agriculture and water in the developing countries, Europe must re-evaluate its water reserves. It is our duty and responsibility to conserve and augment these reserves. Thank you.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Péter Olajos, on behalf of the PPE-DE group . – ( HU ) Thank you, Mr President.
