One moment we have water shortages and the next we have inland inundations and floods. This is a European problem, and Mr Seeber’s report is extremely important here. I would like to amend Esther Herranz García’s proposal in that we do not need a common European position on floods but on water management, as inland inundations and floods cause as big a problem as drought, and those on the committee know only too well that there is no single European risk management basis here. It is in this context that the problem of drought has to be tackled, and not just in Mediterranean countries. My colleague Péter Olajos has mentioned that ground level has shrunk back by four metres in Homokhátság, between the Danube and the Tisza, in the last four decades. Desertification has now reached Hungary and Central Europe. This is a pan-European problem. We can learn a lot from our Israeli colleagues, I am not ashamed to learn, they have excellent irrigation methods.
