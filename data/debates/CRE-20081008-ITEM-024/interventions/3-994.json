{"speaker": "Louis Grech (PSE),", "english": "Louis Grech (PSE), in writing . – Water scarcity is a growing concern for all nations, but the impacts are generally more strongly felt by the poorest regions, leading to great environmental and economic misfortunes. Some countries are affected more than others depending on their geographical location and the core industries of their economies. Such is the case of the Mediterranean region, where water scarcity will be an acute problem as a result of its potential to disrupt tourism. Protecting water as a scarce resource is fundamental for environmental protection and economic development.\nThe creation of a more cohesive policy with regard to water consumption, education and policy integration is necessary at European level to ensure effective and responsible protection of water supply and the environment in Member States. Also, more research is necessary into desalination plants and water recycling technology in order to have a cheaper and more efficient system.\nIn addition, in the EU itself – at least in number of Member States – we need to have better and tougher legislation to curb abuse and pollution of water tables. Moreover, in certain regions the allocation of structural funds to support projects relating to water should be promoted. It is of critical value to ensure that all stakeholders in our society, politicians, industry and consumers themselves believe in this priority to be able to make informed decisions.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Louis Grech (PSE), in writing . – Water scarcity is a growing concern for all nations, but the impacts are generally more strongly felt by the poorest regions, leading to great environmental and economic misfortunes.
