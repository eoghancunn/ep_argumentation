The recent modest warming is comparable to what occurred in the medieval warm period; before that, in the Roman Optimum; and, before that, in the Holocene Optimum.\nTemperatures today are below the maxima of the last 2 000 years. Increasing doubts are being cast on the role of CO 2 . Since 1850, average temperatures correlate well with solar cycles but very poorly with atmospheric CO 2 . The pattern of warming, both geographically and over time, is wholly different from that predicted by computer models.\nThe greenhouse models predict maximum warming in the high atmosphere, but observations show that what little warming there is is at the surface and largely a result of the urban heat-island effect.\nThe greenhouse effect of CO 2 is logarithmic; that is, it is a law of diminishing returns. In greenhouse terms, the atmosphere is already saturated with CO 2 and further emissions will have little effect.\nThe sea-level is rising no faster than it always has, about six to eight inches a century; the global ice mass is broadly constant; severe weather events are no more frequent than they ever were; species extinction is driven not by global warming but by loss of habitat, and especially by the drive for biofuels. Recent studies show that polar bears are doing very well.\nClimate hysteria is increasingly remote from reality. We need to rethink our policies before they do any more damage.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Roger Helmer (NI). – Mr President, for once I come to the House with good news: global warning has stopped. 1998 was the warmest year in living memory.
