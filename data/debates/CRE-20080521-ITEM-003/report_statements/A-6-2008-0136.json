    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the recognition by the Parties to the UNFCCC at their meeting in Bali that IPCC AR4 represents the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment of climate change to date, providing an integrated scientific, technical and socio-economic perspective on relevant issues, as well as the encouragement to draw on the information which it provides in the development and implementation of national policies on climate change;\n",
        "2.Is convinced that science progresses by confronting accepted knowledge and hypotheses with competing ideas, and by applying peer-review procedures; praises the IPCC for its work and its ability to involve the work of thousands of scientists; believes that the IPCC should take new arguments seriously, in order to continue to guarantee the credibility and quality of its research;\n",
        "3.Regards the science of climate change as settled and reiterates its commitment to the EU's strategic objective of limiting the global average temperature increase to not more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, which, according to several scientific reports, can be attained with approximately 50% probability at an atmospheric GHG concentration of 400-450 ppm CO2equivalent and which, according to IPCC AR4, will require industrialised countries to reduce their GHG emissions by 25%-40% below 1990 levels by 2020; believes, notwithstanding this, that all efforts to curb emissions should in fact aim at staying well below the 2°C target, as such a level of warming would already heavily impact on our society and individual lifestyles and would also entail significant changes in ecosystems and water resources;\n",
        "4.Acknowledges that data projections for 2050 clearly show that the time to act is now; underlines that the window of opportunity for starting the mitigation efforts needed to achieve the 2°C target will close by the middle of the next decade;\n",
        "5.Stresses that scientific evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are already affected by regional climate changes due to historical carbon emissions from the industrialised countries; emphasises that it has been scientifically proven that the underlying causes of global warming are predominantly man-made and that the level of gathered knowledge sufficiently proves the anthropogenic disturbance of the Earth's atmosphere;\n",
        "6.Stresses that the projected acidification of the oceans due to rising CO2levels may have very serious effects on marine ecosystems and calls for further research in this area to enhance our understanding of the problem and to identify implications for policy;\n",
        "7.Stresses that scientific results clearly demonstrate how climate change will occur in the near future, following different regional patterns and demonstrating that global warming is both a development issue and a global environmental issue, with poor people and developing countries being the most vulnerable; considers that adaptation aimed at managing the unavoidable consequences of global warming caused by historical emissions from the industrialised countries is as important as intensive mitigation efforts designed to avoid further unmanageable global warming;\n",
        "8.Stresses that tipping points, includinginter aliathe dying back of the Amazon rain forest, the deglaciation of Greenland and of the west Antarctic ice sheet, a collapse of the Indian monsoon and a massive release of methane from the Siberian tundra, are difficult to predict but may all very possibly reach their critical points during the course of this century under current climate change conditions; stresses that avoiding these tipping points will require stronger mitigation efforts than indicated by IPCC AR4;\n",
        "9.Welcomes in this respect the outcome, following established scientific advice, of COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 and in particular the Bali Roadmap, which should be assessed at COP 14 in 2008 and should lead to an agreement on a comprehensive regime by 2009; welcomes also the task allocated to the Expert Group on Technology Transfer of assessing the gaps and barriers to the use of, and access to, financial resources provided to developing countries in response to their commitment to engage in nationally appropriate mitigation actions in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner; equally welcomes the creation of the Adaptation Fund and the inclusion of forests in a new climate protection agreement aimed at avoiding further deforestation and carbon emissions caused by forest or peat land fires, which are also causing enormous damage to local communities, including even the expropriation of their own land through illegal or semi-legal procedures;\n",
        "10.Condemns scientifically unsubstantiated efforts to portray the results of studies into the causes and effects of climate change as doubtful, uncertain or questionable; understands, however, that scientific progress has always been marked by doubt, the progressive elimination of such doubt and the search for explanations or models beyond the current scientific mainstream;\n",
        "11.Believes, therefore, that further research aimed at a better understanding of the causes and consequences of global warming is essential for responsible decision-making; considers, nevertheless, that the level of knowledge acquired to date is sufficient for the urgent formulation of policies that would achieve GHG emission reductions limiting climate change to +2°C and of measures for adaptation to current climate change;\n",
        "12.Stresses the need for further analysis and research into the consequences of climate change such as the effects on economic competitiveness, energy costs and social development in Europe, the role of land use, forests and deforestation, the role of the maritime environment and the calculation of the external climate costs of the industry sector, not least the transport sector, including quantification of the effects of aircraft pollution; considers that further studies are needed in order to mainstream adaptation and risk reduction into development and poverty reduction policy measures;\n",
        "13.Advocates additional research into the impact of the policy of promoting biofuels and their effects on the increase of deforestation, the expansion of cultivated land and world food supplies;\n",
        "14.Believes that the communication of scientific evidence of human impact on the global climate must be the main element of a broader effort to raise public awareness and subsequently gain and maintain public support for political measures to curb carbon emissions, such as interaction with the various social players, not only in the industrialised countries but also in the emerging economies; asks the IPCC to publish a summary of its assessment reports for the public; believes, furthermore, that individual changes in lifestyle patterns are necessary and should be a part of educational programmes to communicate the causes and effects of global warming;\n",
        "15.Calls, therefore, on the scientific community and the political representatives to join forces in raising awareness and lobbying for \"little things which could make the difference\", taking into account the fact that even communities with a well-developed capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change remain vulnerable to extremes and to unpredictable events;\n",
        "16.Stresses that the detailed information needed for low-carbon lifestyle education, including for example GHG footprint declarations on consumer goods and GHG labelling, is poorly developed today and needs to be rapidly developed; stresses that such initiatives should ideally be based on shared standards and should also take into account the embedded GHG emissions from imports;\n",
        "17.Asks its Temporary Committee on Climate Change to continue its work and, at the end of its mandate, to present to Parliament a report containing, as appropriate, recommendations as to actions or initiatives, as well as adaptation and mitigation measures, to be taken on the EU’s future integrated policy on climate change in line with the EU objective of limiting global temperature increases to below 2°C and in accordance with the findings and recommendations of IPCC AR4;\n",
        "18.Calls on the Commission, the Council and Parliament to advocate at the highest level negotiation and dialogue on the strategic extension to all partner countries throughout the world of EU or non-EU countries' highly proficient strategies, principles and standards in the field of scientific research and action for tackling climate change, in accordance with the recommendations of the scientific community;\n",
        "19.Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
