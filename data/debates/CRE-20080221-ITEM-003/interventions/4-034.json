However, I would like to emphasise a problem we addressed in July 2007 in the form of the resolution adopted on the poorest regions in the EU. Unfortunately, no further attention was given to that important issue. Just as the outermost regions have had a special strategy, we now need priority treatment and a strategic approach for the least prosperous regions, in order to overcome their specific difficulties, which are a combination of socioeconomic problems and territorial and spatial characteristics. I hope the Commissioner will address that issue in her Green Paper.\nTherefore, I strongly support the future implementation of cohesion policy in its three dimensions – economic, social and territorial – which could stand as a successful example of the European Union’s solidarity principle.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Evgeni Kirilov (PSE). – Mr President, the fourth cohesion report provides evidence of the positive effects of EU cohesion policy, so the EU must continue to assist EU regions to achieve economic and social prosperity and convergence.\nWe are now addressing new challenges, and have agreed that our efforts must be directed towards dealing with these.
