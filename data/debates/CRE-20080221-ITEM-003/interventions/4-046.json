I would also like to say that I understand the passion of Members from the new Member States.

I certainly will be supporting the wording of ‘sufficient resources’.\nSometimes it is wise to recognise what you have achieved and bank it. I personally support the use at this time of the word ‘sufficient’, especially when many of the funds in those areas have not been spent. I only wish that my own region was half as lucky – we never were – in achieving such help. We are now even as far behind as some of the countries were that we are talking about.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Nicholson (PPE-DE). – Mr President, first of all I would like to give my congratulations to the rapporteurs for their excellent reports.
