We look forward to seeing her in Scotland again soon and to continuing our very fruitful cooperation on this policy.\nBefore I make my brief points, I would echo Mr Guerreiro’s points about support for the fisheries sector within cohesion policy. We will be supporting his amendments, and I do think this sector is of particular strategic importance in our geography.\nI would pick up on the rapporteur’s call for better statistics, particularly for the targeting and monitoring of the efficiency of funding programmes. It seems pretty clear, as things develop, that targeting at NUTS I, NUTS II or even NUTS III level is pretty broad and pretty scatter-gun. I welcome moves in the future funding streams towards more thematic activity, be it the Lisbon Agenda, the promotion of a knowledge economy, the promotion of R&D, cross-border cooperation or, indeed, support for the fisheries sector under the Lisbon Agenda.\nThat is, I believe, the future for a really vibrant cohesion policy for the European Union, which is very much the jewel in the EU’s crown. It has brought the EU closer to our citizens and it has made us one Union where the Member States would keep us a series of different states.\nWe have a great potential to make this policy even more relevant and we look forward to hearing about the Green Paper in the Commissioner’s speech.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE). – Madam President, it is nice to see the Commissioner here in Parliament.
