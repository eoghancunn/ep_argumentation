        "9.   Calls on the EU to take into account the views expressed by the African States as well as the AU in its consideration of the impact of China in Africa; stresses that the EU should avoid generalisations about China’s role, should regard it with an open and constructive attitude, and should not try to impose European models and views;\n",
        "10. Calls on the EU to pursue a dialogue between Africa, the EU and China to common benefit and on the basis of African needs and in the interests of African countries and people, and with a view to improving the effectiveness and coherence of development cooperation, exploring concrete avenues for cooperation and enhancing partnerships, avoiding separate pockets of action; proposes that the EU, the AU and China should set up a standing consultative body to improve the coherence and effectiveness of their respective activities in the area of development cooperation; calls on the EU, China and Africa to establish a global framework for concrete operational projects on common challenges such as adaptation to climate change, renewable energies, agriculture, water and health;\n",

        "49. Calls on the EU to take the lead in climate change mitigation by launching a “crash programme” providing large-scale financial support, additional to existing aid budget lines, for the development and deployment of green energy technologies in both emerging economies and developing countries, recognises however their different needs; specifically calls on the EU to provide funding to enable the transfer of cheap, green technologies to African countries; recognizing that increased funding for technology transfer is a key step to reach agreement on a post-2012 global climate change framework by 2009;\n",
        "50. Urges the EU and China to ensure, along the lines of the Bali Action Plan agreement, that its projects in Africa, in particular energy exploration, are environmentally sustainable and compatible with the Bali Action Plan;\n",
        "51. Recognises the share of responsibility of Western trade and consumption in creating an increasing Chinese demand for natural resources in Africa, as well as for increased CO2emissions in developing countries as a result of the “outsourcing” of polluting industries; calls on the EU to raise the issue of trade and climate justice as part of the agenda of trilateral cooperation with China and Africa; calls also on the EU to strengthen measures to promote socially and environmentally responsible consumption (including product labelling demonstrating the environmental impact during the entire life cycle of a product, from extraction of natural resources to production and transportation);\n",
        "52. Urges the EU to advocate greater international cooperation, in particular with China, to support the urgent implementation of adaptation actions, namely through vulnerability assessments, prioritization of actions, financial needs assessments, capacity-building and response strategies, integration of adaptation actions into sectoral and national planning, specific projects and programmes, means to incentivize the implementation of adaptation actions, and other ways to enable climate-resilient development, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of developing countries vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, such as those in Africa, which are particularly affected by drought, desertification and floods;\n",

        "55. Calls on the EU to act consistently with its own values, principles and commitments under the Cotonou agreement in its relations with those African governments that obstruct democracy and violate human rights by denying them control of aid, budget support or investments; urges the EU to ensure that, in such cases, humanitarian and other assistance is provided through local civil society organisations and helps reinforce the capacity of such organisations; calls on the EU to urge other major donors, such as China, bound by the UN international human rights conventions, covenants and instruments, to act similarly;\n",
        "56. Stresses that, notwithstanding the importance of principles such as sovereignty, ownership and alignment, China’s \"no-conditions\" investments in those African countries misgoverned by oppressive regimes contribute to perpetuating human rights abuses and further delay democratic progress and hinder recognition of good governance, including the rule of law and the control of corruption; in this context, highlights the importance of greater EU support to governments, institutions and civil society actors that promote good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights in Africa, namely national parliaments, pluralist party systems, development and human rights organisations, free media and anti-corruption bodies;\n",
