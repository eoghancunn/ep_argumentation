As the report shows, China is already an important economic and political partner for Africa. Regarding Africa’s development, I believe that there is so much work to do on this continent and that China, as a new player, should be welcome to participate.\nHowever, what I strongly fear is that instead of channelling its support in constructive endeavours – health, education, poverty reduction and infrastructure – China would continue to engage in feeding the tragedies of the continent and will do it by arms trafficking and undermining whatever steps African countries make towards democracy, good governance and respect for human rights. The Chinese ship carrying guns for Zimbabwe again calls into question China’s real commitment to contributing to peace and security in Africa.\nMany African countries welcome their cooperation with China as there is no political conditionality linked to the economic benefits, but the EU should continue to strongly advocate, both to China and the African countries, institution building, human rights advancement and more transparent rules regarding the exploitation of natural resources. Recent developments have shown that, even in those cases where in the last couple of years governments started to show more openness on how public money and resources were spent, they have gone back to a less transparent administration. The EU has the duty to help China to become a trusted partner in development cooperation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Renate Weber (ALDE). – Madam President, I congratulate my colleague Ms Ana Gomes for her work and her comprehensive and realistic assessments.
