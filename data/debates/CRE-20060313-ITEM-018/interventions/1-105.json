{"speaker": "Seán Ó Neachtain,", "english": "Seán Ó Neachtain, on behalf of the UEN Group . – Mr President, I welcome this report by Mr Hutchinson on relocation in the context of regional development. It highlights the importance of EU cohesion policy as a means of alleviating disparities in regions that are lagging behind.\nI come from a country that has benefited from the EU’s structural funds. I therefore welcome this from an Irish point of view, but particularly for my own region – the west and north-west of Ireland. Being a predominantly rural region – 70% of the people live in rural areas – it is more vulnerable than most to the effects of relocation. Europe must protect regions like the west and north-west of Ireland, particularly as regards the settlement pattern, which can only be sustained by balanced regional development. Europe must insist on infrastructure deficits being addressed, especially in areas like transport, energy and modern broadband communication. These deficits inhibit regional competitiveness.\nIn this regard, I warmly welcome the European Commission’s approval last week of the Irish Government’s decision to spend EUR 170 million to extend the broadband network over 70 towns across the state. Measures such as this will assist the competitiveness of regions, attract mobile investment and hopefully offset the tendencies for companies to set up in locations that are already congested. This is the strongest defence against relocation and in favour of strengthening the regions that need that help most.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Seán Ó Neachtain, on behalf of the UEN Group . – Mr President, I welcome this report by Mr Hutchinson on relocation in the context of regional development.
