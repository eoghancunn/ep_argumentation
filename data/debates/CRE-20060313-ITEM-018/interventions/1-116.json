{"speaker": "James Hugh Allister (NI). –", "english": "James Hugh Allister (NI). – Mr President, relocation of industry to cheaper wage economies leaves in its wake economic and social hardship which divides rather than unites the regions of Europe. Within the EU, of course, it is in part a product of the free movements guaranteed under the Treaty and it has come into focus as a real issue because of the precipitous speed and scale of enlargement.\nWith cohesion funding targeted on the new Member States, the situation is set to worsen. This will lead to a development deficit in other European regions. Policy which facilitates relocation thus damages social cohesion. What is urgently required is a stronger policy of denial of EU funds and a facility to recoup them in respect of any company which relocates production to another Member State.\nFive years is far too short a period. There is no future in robbing the old Member States of jobs in order to develop the new Member States. EU funds should play no part in that, nor should we facilitate opportunities for companies to soak up grants and then move on.", "lang": "EN", "original": "James Hugh Allister (NI). – Mr President, relocation of industry to cheaper wage economies leaves in its wake economic and social hardship which divides rather than unites the regions of Europe.
