{"speaker": "Stavros Dimas,", "english": "Stavros Dimas, Μember of the Commission . (EL) Mr President, I thank both you and the members of the European Parliament for your very positive interventions. The European Commission recognises and endorses the fact that the problem of relocation and the loss of the relevant jobs is a seriously worrying issue.\nThe Commission, in agreement with the Member States, made it clear at the last summit at Hampton Court that social protection and the protection of workers' rights are an integral part of European values. In a global environment, every undertaking takes the final decision to locate or relocate its business activities in an independent manner.\nThis sort of decision is determined by numerous factors. For example, according to the information available, it would appear that a decisive factor is often whether or not there is specialised labour available, the possibility of accessing various infrastructures and the level of administrative, bureaucratic formalities. The proper functioning of the internal market allows companies to adapt their productive process to the opportunities available on each occasion. This dynamic aspect of the internal market results in long-term benefits for all regions.\nAs I stressed earlier in my opening speech, the Commission has proposed and applied measures designed to restrict any use of the Structural Funds for purposes unconnected with the sustainable development of each area. In addition, the Commission is proposing to create a fund for adapting to globalisation, a proposal supported by the European Council last December.\nFinally, I should like to emphasise that the Commission is encouraging better collation of the relevant statistics and the drafting of additional studies into the benefits and cost of relocation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stavros Dimas, Μember of the Commission .
