{"speaker": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should just like to point out that Mr Titford from the UK Independence Party just gave one of the most passionate arguments for a European Constitution: he was supporting the initiative of one million Europeans and that can only be legally binding if we have a Constitution.\nI would like to make three points. First, congratulations to Mr Ferber on a wonderful report. It was a good idea to postpone the discharge report because of the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament. I fully support the content of the report and how it has been written. We dealt with that in the Committee on Budgetary Control, where the report was adopted with 25 votes in favour and only one against.\nThe second point is about the blame game. It is true that both parties should be blamed: Parliament’s administration, which was perhaps a little naive, and the City of Strasbourg. There is no denying it. I agree with Mrs Mastenbroek and Mr Busuttil, who said that the City of Strasbourg has worked with us in bad faith. My confidence in the workings of this city has gone down.\nMy final point concerns whether this report and the seat of the European Parliament are somehow linked. They are not, but at the same time it is a matter of how we use money. As in a marriage, it is important to talk about sensitive issues. I fully realise that this is a sensitive issue, but we must remember that it is not only the rent. The truth is that us coming here costs EUR 209 million of taxpayers’ money every year. That is a waste and I support the idea put forward in the ‘oneseat.eu’ campaign of having only one seat. Let us talk about it openly and try to find a solution, but separately from this report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I should just like to point out that Mr Titford from the UK Independence Party just gave one of the most passionate arguments for a European Constitution: he was supporting the initiative of one million Europeans and that can only be legally binding if we have a Constitution.\nI would like to make three points.
