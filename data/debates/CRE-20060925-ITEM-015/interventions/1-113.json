{"speaker": "Simon Busuttil,", "english": "Simon Busuttil, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber. The main conclusion of the investigation into the allegations on the two Strasbourg buildings is that there is no indication of illegality. In this sense, therefore, the allegations were unfounded. However, a number of findings have emerged that, although not illegal, should be stressed here today.\nThe first is that there was indeed an excessive payment of rent in the order of between EUR 32 million and as much as EUR 60 million.\nSecondly, the City of Strasbourg acted in breach of trust when it did things which it knew would never have been acceptable to Parliament, such as keeping part of the rent payments and negotiating a cut of EUR 29 million from the purchase price.\nThirdly, the administration of the European Parliament was also found to be lacking, because over a long period of 30 years it failed in its duty of diligence to ensure that the rent that was paid to Strasbourg for the buildings was not excessive.\nFinally, the European Parliament itself was not united on this issue, for how else can one explain the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control was informed of the allegations well over a month after the Bureau of Parliament itself? How else can one explain that, even as our investigation was taking place, our Bureau continued to negotiate the purchase of the buildings, thereby undermining the political authority of the investigation itself?\nAlthough none of these points constitute unlawful acts, they surely cannot be condoned, still less repeated.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Busuttil, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber.
