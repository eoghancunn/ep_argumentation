{"speaker": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE). –", "english": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE). – Mr President, I want to use my minute to speak on paragraph 88 about the MEP pension scheme and the way the contributions are paid.\nFirstly, I deplore very strongly the fact that some colleagues in this Parliament have been casting slurs on other colleagues. Those who are casting the slurs are not present in this debate, and they have no evidence. It is a disgrace that they can go to the press and try to make their names by casting slurs on honourable Members of this Parliament. Let them produce the evidence before they go around saying such things.\nI have no objection – and I have heard no objections – to our contributions to the pension scheme being deducted directly from our bank accounts. That is perfectly okay. But it should be borne in mind that Parliament would apparently have to recruit five extra full-time staff to do this, at an annual cost of EUR 400 000, in order to check that the right amounts have been transferred from each of the national bank accounts to the central pot. This is because some banks make bank charges to transfer the money and some do not, so that the amounts will vary. Furthermore, as there is no euro currency in 13 of our Member States, the monthly payments will also vary with fluctuations in the exchange rate of national currencies against the euro. All this involves very considerable expense, and we should keep cool heads and refrain from insults.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE). – Mr President, I want to use my minute to speak on paragraph 88 about the MEP pension scheme and the way the contributions are paid.\nFirstly, I deplore very strongly the fact that some colleagues in this Parliament have been casting slurs on other colleagues.
