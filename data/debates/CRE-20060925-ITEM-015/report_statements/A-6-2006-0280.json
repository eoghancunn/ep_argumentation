    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Points up the fact that, in many respects, 2004 was a special year because of a number of almost simultaneous events with a direct impact on Parliament’s financial management: the accession of 10 new Member States, Parliament's elections, the entry into force of the new Staff Regulations, continuing implementation of the new Financial Regulation and the implementation of Parliament’s in-house reform efforts (‘Raising the Game’);\n",
        "2.   Takes note of the figures with which Parliament’s accounts for the financial year 2004 were closed, namely: (in EUR)\n",
        "3.   Notes that, in 2004, 97.76% of the appropriations entered in Parliament’s budget were committed, with a cancellation rate of 2.24%, and that, as in previous years, a very high level of budget implementation was achieved;\n",
        "4.   Calls on authorising officers by delegation to set out the reasons in their annual activity reports, as has already occurred to some extent, why budget appropriations have not been fully utilised; considers that account must be taken of those reasons during the following year’s budgetary discussions;\n",
        "5.   Notes that, in 2004, Parliament received revenue amounting to EUR 117 409 824 (2003: EUR 98 545 334); Accounts\n",
        "6.   Recalls that the high level of implementation for the 2004 budget is partly attributable to the consistent practice since 1992 of making ‘mopping-up’ transfers for the purposes of transferring any appropriations available at year-end to the budget lines for buildings and, in particular, for advance capital payments to reduce future interest payments, more than EUR 70 000 000 having been made available by means of a mopping-up transfer at the end of 2003 for the purchase of the Louise Weiss Building in Strasbourg and more than EUR 150 000 000 having been provided by means of the mopping-up transfer at the end of 2004 for the purchase of the D4 and D5 Buildings in Brussels, which is equivalent to 12% of budget appropriations;\n",
        "7.  Considers that repayments on buildings constitute a major saving for the taxpayer and thereforeshould be set as part of the budgetary strategy;\n",
        "8.  Calls yet again on the budgetary authority to establish budget forecasts ensuring that the amounts entered in the draft budget reflect real requirements in Parliament’s various policy areas so that huge transfers of appropriations are not systematically made at year-end for property policy purposes;\n",
        "9.      Calls for the tendering procedures for the building of the extension to the KAD building in Luxembourg to be transparent and fair, these being the first construction tendering procedures to be managed by the Parliament itself;\n",
        "10.    Welcomes the Secretary General's answer to the 2004 discharge questionnaire regarding the Parliament's use of the LOW building in Strasbourg that Parliament \"is the sole owner of the LOW building in Strasbourg, and may use or dispose of it as it thinks fit,\" which accords with the idea that the Parliament as the democratic representative body in the European Union has the right and the obligation to decide on the most cost-effective and efficient way of working, including in relation to its seat; WIC andSDMBuildings\n",
        "11. Recalls that in May 2006 the Committee on Budgetary Control, in response to the referral back of its report, set up an informal Working Grouptasked with advising and assisting the rapporteur in connection with allegations made over the existing lease arrangements and the prospective purchase by the European Parliament of the WIC and SDM Buildings in the City of Strasbourg;\n",
        "12. Strongly regrets that, despite its competence on Budgetary Control, the Committee only became aware of the allegations relating to the said arrangements from media reports rather than, as should have been expected, from the administration or from the Bureau of the European Parliament, both of which had been fully aware of the allegations for several weeks;\n",
        "13. Notes that its directorates-general responsible made available all documents requested to the working party, including a special external audit and an internal audit as well as legal advice; notes also that the City of Strasbourg also provided documents, upon request, although some queries concerning those documents remained insufficiently answered; strongly regrets that its requests for all relevant documentation from SCI Erasme, the private investor and owner of the buildings, were not acceded to;calls on the City of Strasbourg and SCI Erasme to answer all outstanding and subsequent questions promptly and with due regard for maximum transparency, so that this information can be factored in to the discharge procedure for the financial year 2005;\n",
        "14. Notes that in order to ensure full transparency, the said Working Group immediately called for and obtained full public access to all relevant documentation held by the Parliament’s administration on these buildings;\n",
        "15. Is aware that the discharge report reflects the financial situation of 2004; stresses, however, that such a report does not merely point out mistakes or acts of wrongdoing that have occurred in the past, but should  also make recommendations on how to avoid them in the future;\n",
        "16. Recalls the existence of the rental agreement between SCI Erasme and Strasbourg, which expires in 2010; feels strongly that when the EP decides to purchase the WIC/SDM buildings, the aforementioned agreement cannot in any way have financial consequences for the Parliament; finds therefore that in that case the agreement should cease to exist;\n",
        "17. Points out that if the intention of the Parliament is to purchase the building, it should at the same time acquire the land; Emphasises that at this stage it seems evident that the Parliament can only obtain the long lease held by SCI Erasme; believes therefore that the final acquisition of the land will be the matter between the Parliament and the City of Strasbourg and, if necessary, with the French national authorities;\n",
        "18. Recalls however that ECA has recently conducted an audit on the buildings policy; points out that in its opinion ECA has expressed the concerns as to the use of indexation rates used to calculate the total amount of the bi-annual rent; concludes further that the ECA made it clear the indexation could potentially be unfavourable to the European Parliament;\n",
        "19. Notes that the facts established by the Working Group, on the basis of information made available to it, are the following:\n",
        "20. Draws the following conclusions from what has been experienced:\n",
        "21. Expects the Parliament to continue its work of examining the rental and contractual agreements and related documents between the City of Strasbourg, SCI Erasme and the Parliament in order to establish all the facts;\n",
        "22. Welcomes the report on the additional audit carried out by the European Court of Auditors concerning the renting by the Parliament of the WIC and SDM buildings and endorses its conclusions;\n",
        "23. Notes that the Court of Auditors pointed to weaknesses in supervisory and control systems (paragraph 9.16 of the Court's Annual Report), albeit mostly of a formal nature; notes further that, according to the Court, the errors did not materially affect the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying administrative expenditure (paragraph 9.27);\n",
        "24. Notes that in 2004, when the new Staff Regulations and the new IT application for the calculation of officials' pay were virtually simultaneously introduced , mistakes were made not only because of the IT system but also because of difficulties in interpreting the Staff Regulations; notes that this was countered by stepping up ex-post controls;\n",
        "25. Notes that a new travel expenses settlement procedure was introduced in 2005 in order to comply with the Financial Regulation;\n",
        "26. Attaches considerable importance to the Court of Auditors' comments, which, to some extent, tally with the Internal Auditor’s findings, i.e. that there are still weaknesses in supervisory and control systems; takes the view that those weaknesses are a matter of the utmost priority and asks the Court of Auditors and the Internal Auditor expressly to examine systemic improvements in the next annual report;\n",
        "27. Notes that the analysis of financial management accompanying the 2004 accounts provides a useful statement of the principal financial events of the year under review, as well as a succinct summary of the activity reports of the directors-general; considers that this would be further enhanced, however, by a more standardised presentation of the activities of the directorates-general;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Secretary-General to draw up immediately, and as long since promised, a brief, accessible and attractive annual document to provide the public with more information on budgetary management in Parliament[9];\n",
        "29. Points out that a proportion of management activity in Parliament in 2004 was still geared to adjusting to the new requirements of the Financial Regulation, setting up new control systems, methodologies and working methods, devising training programmes and establishing new lines of responsibility;\n",
        "30. Notes that initial experience with applying the new Financial Regulation in an institution such as Parliament, which has an administrative budget to manage, indicates that in some cases overly complex systems and financial circuits have been set up;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Secretary-General to state how many staff members are currently engaged in control duties (ex-ante control, internal audit) and, by comparison, how many staff members there were in the former Directorate for Financial Control; calls on the Secretary-General in this connection to produce a comparative analysis and appraisal of the new system and the former financial control system which establishes whether increased staff resource deployment can be justified;\n",
        "32. Reaffirms, yet again, the view expressed in paragraph 34 of its above-mentioned resolution of 12 April 2005 and in its resolutions of 21 April 2004[10]and 8 April 2003[11]that ‘the scope of the discharge procedure should cover not only the management activities of Parliament's Secretary-General and Administration, but also the decisions taken by its governing bodies, i.e. its President, Bureau and Conference of Presidents’;\n",
        "33. Strongly criticises its Bureau and competent committee for their inaction; calls on them to respond immediately to the request formulated in paragraphs 16 and 17 of its above‑mentioned resolution of 21 April 2004 for proposals intended to define the precise practical meaning of the political responsibility attaching to the members of Parliament's governing bodies as regards the exercise of powers and the taking of decisions with significant financial consequences;\n",
        "34. Calls on the Bureau to consult fully, in advance, the individuals affected by its decisions in order to make decision-taking processes transparent; calls furthermore on the Bureau to submit an annual activity report, which, in keeping with democratic accountability, should be a component of the budget discharge procedure;\n",
        "35. Stresses that Parliament grants discharge not to the Secretary-General, but, rather, to the President; therefore expects the President to make himself available to the Committee on Budgetary Control, during the discharge procedure, for a dialogue;\n",
        "36. Points out that Parliament's Secretary-General forwarded the 2004 activity reports of the directors-general to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 21 April 2005; points out further in that connection that the Secretary-General, in his capacity as authorising officer by delegation, declared that he had been given reasonable assurances that Parliament's budget had been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place afforded the requisite guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions;\n",
        "37. Notes that the various activity reports differ widely in scope, length, form and the degree to which the information from services within directorates-general is incorporated; invites the Secretary-General, as proposed by the Court of Auditors last year (in paragraph 9.16 of  the Court's 2003 Annual Report), to harmonise the presentation and structure of the activity reports in the future in order to make them more easily readable and comparable;\n",
        "38. Calls on Parliament's Administration to forward to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in future, the final version of activity reports, including authorising officers' declarations, together with all annexes;\n",
        "39. Welcomes the fact that all directors-general have issued a declaration of assurance for their departments' financial transactions; notes that only in one case - concerning procurement in DG Information - was reference made to weaknesses, though they do not represent a reservation;\n",
        "40. Recalls the proposal made in paragraph 30 of its above-mentioned resolution of 12 April 2005 that for the sake of a better understanding of the true value of authorising officers' signed declarations it would be desirable in future years to adopt a standardised format clearly distinguishing between those matters calling for an 'observation' by the director-general, which do not call into question his declaration of assurance, and other more serious matters justifying a 'reservation';\n",
        "41. Notes that the conclusions in the activity reports identify the following general challenges:\n",
        "42. Highlights the fact that the Internal Auditor's annual report and the declarations and activity reports of the Secretary-General and the directors-general constitute a major part of the assessment both by the Court of Auditors and by Parliament's discharge authority;\n",
        "43. Points out that the internal control systems put in place by the authorising officers by delegation have the following control objectives: compliance with applicable legislation, rules and practices, the reliability of management information and records and the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of operations;\n",
        "44. Points out further that authorising officers must comply with 22 minimum standards in order to realise those control objectives; notes that those standards can be grouped into five control categories: control environment, performance and risk management, information and communication, control activities and monitoring (audit and evaluation);\n",
        "45. Notes that, in 2004, the Internal Audit Service produced 13 reports on the internal monitoring and control framework in the directorates-general and examined the financial management of four of Parliament's Information Offices;\n",
        "46. Highlights the fact that the action plans adopted on the basis of the audit reports permit the following conclusions:\n",
        "47. Considers that, on the basis of the experience gained, the responsible authorising officers by delegation must ensure that:\n",
        "48. Notes  that these priority areas are reflected in the Secretary-General's action plan, subject to paragraph 47;\n",
        "49. Notes that the handling of procurement procedures and Members' parliamentary assistance allowances are currently the subject of ongoing audits; considers that the audit reports should be assessed during the budget discharge procedure for 2005;\n",
        "50. Asks the Internal Auditor to take account also of the principle of efficiency and economy in the management of funds as an aspect of verifying the regularity and legality of expenditure operations;\n",
        "51. Asks the Internal Auditor not only to forward his annual reports to the Committee on Budgetary Control, but also to give an oral account of them;\n",
        "52. Recalls that the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules[13]which entered into force on 1 January 2003 modified the procedures for planning, publishing and awarding procurement contracts; recalls further that the institutions forward to the budgetary authority reports on negotiated procedures and on contracts not falling under public procurement directives, that a list of contractors with contracts worth more than EUR 50 000, but less than the threshold under those directives, is published in the Official Journal, and that contracts worth between EUR 13 800 and EUR 50 000 are published on institutions’ websites; notes in addition that in 2003 Parliament called on its Secretary-General to report annually on contracts concluded[14];\n",
        "53. Notes that the annual report contains the following information on contracts concluded in 2004:\n",
        "54. Notes that the Internal Auditor is completing an institution-wide audit of the procurement process; calls on the Secretary-General to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control about the content of the report in an appropriate manner;\n",
        "55. Regrets the fact that, in 2004, the number and value of contracts awarded under open procedures fell considerably; calls on the Secretary-General to give reasons for this;\n",
        "56. Asks whether the contracts database required by Article 95 of the Financial Regulation has already been set up and is operational;\n",
        "57. Asks whether the suggestions made last year by the Administration for changes to the Financial Regulation[15](low-value contracts awarded through competitive tendering, electronic tendering information exchange) have been taken on board;\n",
        "58. Points out that, under Article 276 of the EC Treaty, it is the task of Parliament to give the Commission discharge for implementation of the budget, this process encompassing all spending areas; regrets therefore that, because of Parliament’s existing internal organisational provisions governing delegations in third states, it was not possible for the Committee on Budgetary Control to carry out, in time, the planned visit by the ad hoc delegation to the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo;\n",
        "59. Calls therefore on Parliament’s competent bodies to make it possible for the Committee on Budgetary Control, pursuant to its parliamentary obligations under the budget discharge procedure, to be able, where appropriate, to send small delegations to Member States and third states quickly, and without red tape, in order to carry out the necessary checks on the spot;\n",
        "60. Recalls that paragraph 2.7.3 of the Rules on the use of appropriations from budget Item 3701[16]requires the Bureau and the Committee on Budgetary Control to deal with the audited annual accounts of the political groups in accordance with the powers conferred upon them by the Rules of Procedure;\n",
        "61. Reiterates that the political groups are themselves responsible for the management and use of their funds from Parliament’s budget and that the remit of Parliament’s Internal Audit Service does not extend to the conditions under which use is made of the appropriations against budget Item 3701 (approximately 3.2% of Parliament’s total budget);\n",
        "62. Welcomes the fact that the political groups have published their internal financial rules and accounts for 2004 on Parliament’s website;\n",
        "63. Asks whether the political groups have encountered problems when applying the principles of the new Financial Regulation and its implementing rules;\n",
        "64. Records the following outturn figures for appropriations entered against budget Item 3701 in 2004: (in thousands of EUR)\n",
        "65. Notes the confirmation by the political groups’ external auditors that the accounts complied with current rules and international accounting standards;\n",
        "66. Regrets that until July 2004, trainee contracts and service provider contracts with independent persons, companies or foundations were entered into the Parliament's computer system with the same code without regard for the type of contract or whether the contract referred to an assistant or a trainee;\n",
        "67. Regrets that insufficient information has been forwarded to the Secretary General on the amounts of pay received by the high proportion of assistants employed via service providers; welcomes the information received from the Secretary General on the amounts paid to assistants directly employed by Members or paid through a paying agent;\n",
        "68. Notes that on 29 September 2005 the Bureau discussed and approved the groups’ reports on budget implementation and the auditors’ reports;\n",
        "69. Notes that, as a rule, the political groups did not fully utilise the appropriations made available to them;\n",
        "70.Calls on the Commission and the Council to regulate definitively and comprehensively, in the forthcoming negotiations on reform of the Financial Regulation, how funds made available to the political groups from Parliament's budget are to be treated in law, as called for by Parliament in its position of 15 March 2006[17];\n",
        "71. Welcomes the fact that the above-mentioned Statute for Members of the European Parliament, following the Council’s agreement on 19 July 2005, will enter into force on the first day of the parliamentary term commencing in 2009;\n",
        "72. Points out that the provisions of the Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members were brought into line with the Financial Regulation in May 2004;\n",
        "73. Recalls the Bureau decision of 28 May 2003 ‘to initiate, once the plenary has adopted the Statute of Members of the European Parliament and in accordance with the calendar for the Statute’s entry into force, the procedure for the adoption by the Bureau of new rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members ...’; calls on the Secretary-General to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control as to what measures the Bureau has taken to date;\n",
        "74. Calls on the Bureau to implement the plans already provided for in the Statute for Members, agreed by Parliament, to create a system, for those Members who so desire, to reimburse Members only for travel costs actually incurred;\n",
        "75. Notes that on 13 December 2004 the Bureau adopted amendments to the rules governing the secretarial assistance allowance[18]intended inter alia to ensure greater consistency between those rules and the requirements of the Financial Regulation;\n",
        "76. Regrets that, as of 20 February 2006, 87.2% of Members had not supplied the Parliament with statements of expenditure for their parliamentary assistance allowance, which were due by 1 November 2005, as required by Articles 14(5)(e) and 14(6)(b) and (c) of the Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members, and which include declarations of their assistants’ affiliation to a social security scheme if the assistant is covered by a service provider contract; regrets further that Parliament has not yet concluded framework contracts with companies specialised in management, in accordance with the applicable national law, of tax and social security issues connected with employment contracts, as is required by Article 14(5)(f) of the Rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members and as has been requested at least from July 2004;\n",
        "77. Insists that sending individual communications to those Members who have not yet submitted documents would be the most efficient way of resolving the problem of missing documentation due from Members on expenditure from the parliamentary assistance allowance;\n",
        "78. Calls on the Bureau promptly to wind up discussions on the outcome of the work of the parliamentary working party on Members' assistants; calls on the Secretary-General to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control about the working party’s proposals and the Bureau's decision;\n",
        "79. Calls on the Bureau to establish a statute for Members’ assistants regulating inter alia recruitment and working conditions as well as social security and taxation arrangements; urges that this should enter into force as soon as possible;\n",
        "80. Recalls that the Court of Auditors has pointed out in its Annual Reports for the last three years that a sufficient legal basis for Parliament’s additional pension scheme must be created; recalls that, in addition, according to the Court, clear rules must be established to cover the eventuality of a deficit[19]; notes however that the view of the Parliament's legal services is that \"a sufficient legal basis for the additional pension scheme\" already exists under \"the regulatory autonomy of the European Parliament laid down in Article 199 of the EC Treaty (formerly Article 142 of the EEC Treaty) which confers on the European Parliament the right to take whatever measures it requires for its internal organisation\"[20]and that furthermore \"once the Members' Statute comes into force, Article 27 of that Statute will constitute the legal basis for the Pension Fund\"2;\n",
        "81.Points, in addition, to this year’s activity report of DG Finance, which, with regard to the additional pension scheme, lists the following :\n",
        "82. Notes that, in November 2005, the additional pension fund had 475 members; they paid a monthly contribution - from the general expenditure allowance - of EUR 948 (representing one third); Parliament paid EUR 1 896 monthly (representing two thirds); in 2004, EUR 10 300 000 was entered in the budget for the voluntary pension scheme;\n",
        "83. Notes that, as at 31 December 2004, the pension fund recorded an actuarial deficit of EUR 43 756 745 and a funding level of 76.8 % and that, as at 31 December 2005, the deficit had fallen substantially to EUR 28 875 417 and the funding level had increased to 86.1%[21];\n",
        "84. Notes that, as from January 2005, a member can draw a monthly pension of EUR 1 276 from age 60 onwards and after only five years of contributions;\n",
        "85. Notes that the Bureau has not acted on the Court of Auditors’ observations between 2002 and 2005; notes that, on 30 November 2005, the Bureau approved the following measures:\n",
        "86. Takes the view that  the relationship between Parliament and the pension fund should be placed on a contractual footing by the end of this year; calls on the Secretary-General to forward to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in December   2006, a report on the progress achieved;\n",
        "87. Believes, furthermore, that Members' contributions to the voluntary pension scheme should be paid directly from personal income rather than through the parliamentary allowance system; Notes, however, that in respect of the current contribution system \"in its Opinion No 5/99, the Court of Auditors arrived at the following conclusion \"From the Fund's and from the members point of view, the system has worked effectively. Additionally it has enabled Parliament to calculate its own payment obligations correctly since, according to the rules, Parliament has to pay the double of the amount effectively paid by the members\"; notes that the Court saw no problems in maintaining the system provided that it was better defined and its operation set down in a formal document;\n",
        "88. Notes with concern that the deduction of contributions to the pension scheme from the general expenditure allowance leaves Members exposed to allegations that public funds may be put towards the cost of private pension contributions, and therefore calls on the Parliament's Bureau to propose before 31 March 2007 measures to ensure that such payments are made directly by pension scheme members through direct debit orders;\n",
        "89. Notes that, after the Statute for Members of the European Parliament enters into force in 2009, Members will be treated equally and the additional pension fund will no longer be allowed to admit new members; takes the view furthermore that once the Statute for Members has entered into force:\n",
        "90. Notes the following presentation of the accounts of the political parties at European level in 2004:\n",
        "91. Underscores the fact that the parties’ external auditors have confirmed that the accounts comply with current rules and international accounting standards;\n",
        "92. Highlights the fact that parties at European level have not yet been able fully to utilise the appropriations available to them;\n",
        "93.Points out that, in its position of 15 March 2006[22]on reform of the Financial Regulation, it made a proposal on the legal treatment of the own resources of political parties at European level within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding[23];\n",
        "94. Recalls that its committee responsible will shortly be submitting a report on the application of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 and that this Regulation was applied for the first time in 2004;\n",
        "95. Calls on the Bureau to take account of the following considerations for a more efficient application of this Regulation:\n",
        "96. Calls on the Secretary-General to report by the end of December 2006 on the progress achieved in recruiting staff from the new Member States by category (interpreters, translators, administrative staff, etc.);\n",
        "97. Underscores the fact that multilingualism is one of the characteristic features of the European Union and gives expression to the Union's cultural and linguistic diversity and ensures equal treatment for its citizens; emphasises the fact that multilingualism guarantees the right of citizens to communicate with European Union institutions in one of the Union's official languages, thereby making it possible for citizens to exercise their right to democratic control;\n",
        "98. Points out that it has conducted a detailed examination of the Court of Auditors' Special Report 5/2005 in a separate resolution;\n",
        "99. Recognises that its frequent journeys between its seats causes significantly higher costs in a number of areas of its activities, including interpretation, as concluded by the Court of Auditors in its Special Report 5/2005;\n",
        "100.    Points to its decision of 9 October 2003 on the conclusion of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking[24]and notes the conclusions of the working party on impact assessment[25]; accordingly\n",
        "101.    Takes the view that the inclusion of impact assessments involves risks which might impair parliamentary work; accordingly,\n",
        "102.    Calls therefore on the Secretary-General and the competent parliamentary bodies to explain how they propose to implement this aspect of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking;\n",
        "103.    Welcomes the fact that the Internal Audit Service's audit reports have been reflected in the Secretary-General's revised action plan, which has been forwarded by him to Parliament's competent bodies together with his declaration of assurance; recalls that the action plan contains 47 individual measures and calls on the Secretary-General to explain which of those measures he has set as priorities;\n",
        "104.    Notes that Parliament ensures implementation of budget Item 3701 for the non-attached Members and has certified the reliability of such implementation; recalls that documents relating to this budget item are published on Parliament's website;\n",
        "105.    Notes that the Secretary-General's proposals firstly for a standard letter for selecting the groups’ external auditors and secondly for the group chairmen's financial reports have been submitted to the Bureau for discussion and adoption; notes that a decision has not yet been taken and calls on the Bureau to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control of the outcome of the discussions;\n",
        "106.    Notes that in 2004, in preparation for applying the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, Parliament made a start on technically merging the management systems for the payment of allowances to Members of Parliament, which, until then, had been running independently of each other (the PAM Project - Portail Applicatif des Membres, or Members' Application Portal);\n",
        "107.    Notes that the Disciplinary Board has completed its work on allocating responsibility in connection with the discrepancy of BEF 4 136 125 between the cash situation and the corresponding accounts in 1982; expects that amount, including interest, to be recovered;\n",
        "108.    Notes with satisfaction that on 12 December 2005 the Bureau adopted the final report by the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) working group and that the report on the environmental management system within Parliament will be posted on Parliament's website in February 2006;\n",
