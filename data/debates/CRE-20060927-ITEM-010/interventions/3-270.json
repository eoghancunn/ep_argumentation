{"speaker": "Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Karim on the excellent and extensive report on the EU’s economic and trade relations with India. We neglect the relationship with India, with its opportunities for both India and Europe, to our mutual cost.\nIn the future, if the EU concentrates more of its efforts on economic policy instead of other distractions, I see the potential for a massive free-trading alliance. The United Kingdom, with its historic links, will play a key role in this development. I am therefore delighted that the British Conservative Leader, David Cameron, is devoting particular attention to relations with India. He seized the opportunity while with the business community in Mumbai recently to set out his views on globalisation. He also touched on the challenge of terrorism.\nTerrorism is the curse of our age. If afflicts many European countries. It has become a tragic fact of life in India as well, not just in Kashmir but in Mumbai where 200 people were murdered in July and in Malegaon on 8 September 2006, where some 40 people were killed. The precise responsibility for these attacks is still unclear, but there is strong suspicion of external involvement.\nPost-9/11, Pakistan has helped the democracies to fight terrorism along its western border with Afghanistan, but it has done precious little to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on its eastern border with India or to control the extremist madrassas that provide the hotbed in which terrorists are cultivated.\nIn order to proceed with the welcome and ongoing peace process between India and Pakistan, Pakistan must implement the solemn assurances it has given to stop all cross-border terrorism and to deliver on the words of President Musharraf in this Parliament on 12 September 2006.\nAs one of the great democracies, India attracts the rage of extremists. This threat can be defeated only by the concerted efforts of our nations and agencies working together in close cooperation.\nI welcome the opportunities we have for deep engagement with India and for India’s wider regional role.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Karim on the excellent and extensive report on the EU’s economic and trade relations with India.
