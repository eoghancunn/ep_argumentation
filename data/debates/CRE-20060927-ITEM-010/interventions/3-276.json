In contrast to last month’s debate on EU-China relations, his work and report have been a model of cooperation and consensus and my Group and I will be supporting his report. I only have to apologise that I will be absent for tomorrow’s vote, as I will be attending the Labour Party Conference in Manchester.\nI have one general comment and two specific points on the report. First, we in the PSE Group do not want any hint that a bilateral FTA can substitute for a successful completion of the Doha Development Round. We know India is committed in this regard, but not all MEPs share that commitment.\nSecondly, while I offered a guarded welcome to back liberalisation, I share some of Mr Markov’s concerns as to the social impact on small farmers and businesses as preferential lending will end. If Mr Markov’s amendment had been more judiciously phrased it would have gained my support.\nThirdly, I do not welcome India’s involvement in ITER. I believe the whole ITER Programme is mistaken and would have been delighted if it had gone to Japan so they would have wasted more of their money and we less of ours. I can only commiserate with the people of India.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Glyn Ford (PSE). – First, let me congratulate Mr Karim on his report on EU-India trade relations.
