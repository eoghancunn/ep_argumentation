    "paragraphs": [
        "1. Welcomes a new approach to labour law that aims to cover all workers regardless of their contractual situation;\n",
        "2.  Welcomes discussions on the need to improve labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century, in particular the need to reduce the insecurity sometimes associated with non-standard forms of employment, and to enhance the protection of vulnerable workers, in order to create more  and better jobs and greater social cohesion, thereby helping to achieve the goals of the Lisbon Strategy; considers that improving labour law should  be consistent with the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with particular reference to Title IV, and must respect and safeguard the values of the European social model and established social rights;\n",
        "3.   Notes with great concern that the Commission's Green Paper, while recognising that the current labour market conditions create gender inequality, for example in terms of the gender pay gap and occupational and sectoral segregation, totally ignores the obligations and responsibilities under the Commission comunication entitled 'A Roadmap for equality between women and men' (COM(2006)0092);\n",
        "4.  Notes, again with great concern, that the Green Paper, although recognising that women face an imbalance between their professional and private lives, ignores the urgent need for action in order to reconcile professional and private life with demographic challenges, which complies with the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Commission’s Communication on the demographic future of Europe (COM(2006)0571);\n",
        "5.  Considers that the priorities for labour law reform are: (a) extending protection to workers in atypical forms of employment; (b) clarifying the situation of dependent employment and the grey areas between self-employment and employees with a dependent employment relationship; (c) taking action against undeclared work; and (d) facilitating the transition between various situations of employment and unemployment;\n",
        "6.  Underlines that the European economy needs more people in employment in order to be able to compete globally and to fulfil the promises of social security;\n",
        "7.  Regrets, however, that the social partners were not consulted as foreseen by Article 138 of the EC Treaty, considering that the Green Paper clearly has important implications for the social policy field;\n",
        "8.  Considers that, if labour law is to meet the challenges of the 21st century, it must focus to a large extent on employment security  throughout a worker's life rather than protecting particular jobs, making it easier both to enter and to stay in the labour market and to change from unemployment to employment and from one job to another through the use of active labour policies focused both on human capital development and on creating a supportive business climate as well as improving the quality of jobs;\n",
        "9.  Considers that the labour relations which characterise citizens’ employment and professional activity have been subject to profound changes over the course of the last decade, notes that the permanent full-time contract is the common form of the working relationship and as such should be seen as the reference for a coherent and consistent application of the principle of non-discrimination, therefore believes that European labour law should reinforce employment contracts of an indefinite duration as the general form of employment where adequate social and health protection is provided and respect for fundamental rights is ensured;\n",
        "10. In this respect acknowledges the need for working time arrangements to be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of employers and employees and to enable people to better balance work and family life as well as to safeguard competitiveness and improve the employment situation in Europe, without neglecting the health of employees;\n",
        "11. Strongly disagrees with the analytical framework presented in the Green Paper, which claims that the standard indefinite employment contract is outdated, increases labour market segmentation and the gap between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders, and must therefore be regarded as an obstacle to employment growth and improved economic dynamism;\n",
        "12. Stresses that labour legislation is only efficient, fair and strong if it is implemented by all Member States,  applied equally to all actors and controlled on a regular basis and in an efficient manner; requests that within the “Better legislation” initiative the Commission should strengthen its role as Guardian of the Treaty concerning the implementation of social and employment legislation; criticizes the Commission for interfering with Member State’s right to control the application of Community law in the case of posting of workers;\n",
        "13. Points out that recent OECD and other studies have shown that there is no evidence for the claim that reducing dismissal protection and weakening standard employment contracts facilitates employment growth; points out that the example of the Scandinavian countries shows clearly that a high level of dismissal protection and employment standards is fully compatible with high employment growth;\n",
        "14. Notes that certain forms of  non-standard contracts, depending on how well they are embedded in labour and social security law, as well as the provision of lifelong learning and training opportunities, can contribute both to improving the EU’s economic competitiveness and also to for catering for different needs of workers, bearing in mind the stage of life they are at and their job prospects; at the same time recognises that non-standard forms of work must go hand in hand with support for workers who find themselves in  situations of transition from one job to another, or from one employment status to another; also notes that in order to make this transition rapid and sustainable, it is necessary to focus on active intervention allowing workers who re-enter the labour market to be entitled to some level of income support during the period strictly necessary for them to become more employable through training and requalification;\n",
        "15. Stresses that the Green Paper should focus on labour law itself;\n",
        "16. Regrets the Commission's focus on individual labour law, and urges the Commission to focus on and promote collective labour law as the means to increase both flexibility and security for workers and employers;\n",
        "17. Firmly believes that any form of employment, whether non-standard or otherwise, should carry with it a core of rights regardless of the specific employment status, which should include: equal treatment, workers’ health and safety protection and provisions on working/rest time, freedom of association and representation, collective bargaining, collective action, and access to training;at the same time stresses that these matters should be adequately enforced at Member State level, taking into account the different traditions and social and economic circumstances in each country; underlines that European legislation is not in contradiction to national legislation, but should be viewed as complementary;\n",
        "18. Notes that a fundamental part of labour law in many Member States, and as enshrined in the Treaty, is the right to take collective action, and that the Commission has stated in proceedings before the Court of Justice that the specific form of some Nordic collective actions is in accordance with the EC Treaty, and requests the Commission to respect collective agreements as a specific type of labour law as recognised by the Court of Justice;\n",
        "19. Requests that all workers have access to the same level of protection and that certain groups are not excluded by default from the broadest level of protection, such as is currently often the case for seafarers, workers on vessels and offshore workers as well as workers in road transport; requests that efficient legislation should apply to all persons regardless of the place where they work;\n",
        "20.Considers that excessive administrative burdenscan deter employers from taking on new workers even during times of economic growth, thereby worsening job prospectsand preventing workers from entering the labour market. Stresses that job creation is a priority European objective in accordance with the decisions taken by the Council in Lisbon in 2000;\n",
        "21. Notes the growing informal economy and especially the labour exploitation of undocumented workers and considers that the best ways to combat this phenomenon are to focus on instruments and mechanisms to tackle exploitation, including more and better enforcement of labour law and labour standards and to make legal employment easier and focus on fundamental human rights of workers; calls on Member States to bring forward legislation to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers by gangmasters and to sign and ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families and to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on trafficking in human beings;\n",
        "22. Welcomes the wide variety of labour traditions, contractual forms and business models existing in labour markets;\n",
        "23. Calls for the creation of flexible and secure contractual arrangements in the context of modern work organizations;\n",
        "24. Highlights that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are recognised as a major driver for creating and increasing employment in Europe as well as fostering social and regional development; believes therefore that it is vital to increase SME's role in improving labour law;\n",
        "25. Considers that for more effective application of European law it is necessary to strengthen the industrial relations system and respond appropriately to the absence of employee representation in certain sectors, where most economic activity is undertaken by SMEs employing fewer than 10 people (this absence of representation being particularly pronounced in the new Member States);\n",
        "26. Endorses the Council’s aim of mobilising all appropriate national and Community resources to develop a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce and labour markets responsive to the challenges stemming from the combined impact of globalisation and of the ageing of European societies;\n",
        "27.Notes that due to labour market segmentation, where job security is low and employment is more unstable,, in many of non standard contracts there is little access to education and training, occupational pensions and professional development provided, and in  general underinvestment in human capital; underlines that this increases economic insecurity and creates opposition to change and globalization in general;\n",
        "28.    Notes that, in many Member States, because no adequate social security exists, it is impossible to obtain a pension in the second pillar, bringing extra pressure to bear on old-age pensions in the first pillar;\n",
        "29. Believes that a combination of individual motivation, employers' support, accessibility and availability of facilities are the most important factors as regards participation in the process of lifelong learning and calls for the development of the education sector and schools which meet labour market requirements and workers’ and employers’ individual expectations; stresses the need for proper linking of professional careers and school syllabuses;\n",
        "30. Points to the urgent need to improve the educational level of the EU population and urges the Commission, Member States and the social partners to invest in lifelong learning and the development of human capital as the most effective means of overcoming long-term unemployment, in which connection the development of skills and the acquisition of qualifications is in the general interest, as the European social partners jointly emphasise in the 2006 Framework of Action for the Lifelong Development of Competences and Qualifications';\n",
        "31. Is of the opinion that reforms of labour law should facilitate companies' investment in the skills of their workers, stimulate workers to upgrade their own skills and guarantee the intervention of social security systems to ensure such an approach;\n",
        "32.Stresses the importance of arriving at a degree of consistency in the field of labour law, which may be achieved though directives and collective agreements and the open method of coordination, urges the Commission to take account of the vast differences that exist between national labour markets and the Member States' competency in this area,but reminds of the goal to create a competitive, innovative and inclusive Europe and more and better jobs;\n",
        "33. Notes the lack of proper implementation and enforcement of existing European legislation, and calls on the Commission coordinate between national labour law and social inspectorates; (ex 337)stresses the need for Member States to bring their health and safety legislation in accordance with European legislation;\n",
        "34. Considers that the rights of cross-border workers could be adequately protected under the relevant legislation if it were effectively implemented and that the aim of adopting a single definition of a worker and a self-employed person under Community law is extremely complex because of the very different social and economic realities and traditions in the individual Member States. At the same time, there needs to be an initiative aimed at raising a certain level of convergence necessary to guarantee that the implementation of the Community acquis is coherent and more efficient; this convergence should respect the rights of the Member States to determine the existence of an employment relationship;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission to ensure that a distinction be drawn in compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Court of Justice; calls on the Commission to initiate negotiations with the Member States as a matter of urgency, with the aim of establishing transparent and consistent criteria for determining the status of \"workers\" and \"self-employed persons\" in employment law; restates Parliaments position that any definition of a worker should be based on the de facto situation at the place and time of work;\n",
        "36. Calls on Member States to promote the implementation without delay by the Member States of the 2006 ILO Recommendation on the scope of the employment relationship;\n",
        "37. Appeals to the Member States to note the Recommendation of the International Labour Organisation that employment law should not interfere with genuine commercial relationships;\n",
        "38. Urges that the open method of coordination be used in the sphere of employment policy and social policy as a useful instrument for exchanging best practice so as to respond to joint challenges in a flexible and transparent manner and taking into account the diverse conditions which are of crucial importance for labour markets in individual Member States;\n",
        "39. Recommends to the Member States, the Council and the Commission that, within the framework of the Open Method of Coordination, they exchange best practices concerning the flexible organisation of working time and take account of innovative working time arrangements that strike a good balance between work and family life;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Commission to continue collecting and analysing information on national labour markets so as to ensure that exchanges of good practice in connection with the employment policies pursued in individual Member States are based on reliable data,particularly homogeneous and comparable statistics;\n",
        "41.Calls on the Member States to review and adapt social security systems and to complement active labour market policies, particularly training and life long learning with a view tonew realities of work supporting professional transitions and (ex 386)re-entry into labour market to prevent any unnecessary dependence on benefits and work in the informal sector;\n",
        "42. Strongly condemns the abusive replacement of regular employment with new forms of employment without any imperative economic necessity, which is commonly resorted to in European media undertakings in particular, with the aim of maximising short-term profits to a far greater than normal extent, at the expense of the general public, employees and competitors; stresses that such action violates the European social model, as it lastingly destroys the consensus, fairness and trust between employers and employees; urges Member States and the two sides of industry to take action in this regard in order to halt irresponsible abuses;\n",
        "43. Reminds that flexicurity is defined as combining flexibility and security in the job market in a way that helps increase both productivity and the quality of jobs by guaranteeing security, while at the same time allowing firms the flexibility needed to create jobs in response to the changing needs of the market; is of the opinion that flexibility and security requirements are not contradictory and are mutually reinforcing;\n",
        "44. Stresses that flexicurity can only be achieved by effective and modern labour law that reflects the changing realities of work; Notes that collective bargaining and strong social partners are an important part of the flexicurity approach; believes however that there are various models of flexicurity. Notes that a common approach should be based on combining firms and workers ability to adapt with a sufficient level of social protection, social security and unemployment benefits, active labour market policies and training/ lifelong learning opportunities; Considers that broad welfare provisions and universal access to services such as childcare and other dependents contribute positively to these aims;\n",
        "45. Believes that the definition of flexicurity in the Commission's Green Paper is too narrow; notes however that the Commission will publish a communication on flexicurity;\n",
        "46. Believes that older workers should be able to remain in the workforce on a voluntary and flexible basis, supported by appropriate training and healthcare at work; highlights the urgent need for positive action to encourage older workers re-enter the labour market, and the need for more flexibility in the choice of pension and retirement schemes;\n",
        "47. Calls on the Commission and Member States to recognise that labour law,has an immense influence on the behaviour of enterprises, and that their confidence in stable, clear and sound provisions is a key element when taking decisions to create more and better jobs and calls therefore on the Member States to implement and enforce properly all the existing EU legislation affecting labour markets;\n",
        "48. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to strengthen rights for parental leave and childcare provisions at both national and European level for both men and women;\n",
        "49. Welcomes the strategy outlined to fight against undeclared work and the underground economy, which - although present to a varying extent in the different Member States - damages the economy, leaves workers unprotected, is detrimental to consumers, reduces tax revenues and leads to unfair competition between firms; shares the Commission's approach to combat undeclared work through a strong coordination between government enforcement agencies, labour inspectorates and/or trade unions, social security administrations and tax authorities and calls on  Member States to use innovative methods based on indicators and benchmarks specific to the different business sectors in order to fight against fiscal erosion;\n",
        "50. Calls on the Commission to launch an information campaign directed at employers and workers aimed at drawing attention to the applicable EU minimum rules and regulations and adverse effects clandestine work can have on national social security systems, public finances, fair competition, economic performance and on workers themselves;\n",
        "51. Calls for special attention to be directed to young workers who are most engaged in temporary work to ensure that their lack of experience on the job does not lead to work-related accidents; encourages Member States to exchange good practice in this regard and calls on temporary employment agencies to raise awareness among employers and the young workers themselves;\n",
        "52. Highlights the role of the social partners in informing and training workers and employers on their rights and obligations in an employment relationship and on the enforcement of existing law in this area and therefore calls on the Commission to promote technical support for social partners and to encourage them to share (ex 434)knowledge and experience in order toimprove working conditions;\n",
        "53. Highlights the valuable role played by the social partners which already achieved some success in reforming labour markets, namely through the conclusion of agreements on parental leave, part time work and fixed-term contracts, as well as telework and lifelong learning;\n",
        "54. Believes that the Member States must demonstrate a spirit of openness in the dialogue with the social partners on the subject of modernising labour law and adapting it to the challenges of the 21st century, take account of the social partners’ arguments and respond to their concerns;\n",
        "55. Points to the positive role that collective bargaining at national, sectoral and company level can play in employment relationships and work organisation, increasing the productivity of firms and improving working conditions, thereby encouraging growth in employment and points to the possibility of changing arrangements so as to strengthen the role of collective bargainingand open up such bargaining for solutions close at company level which benefit employees and employers;\n",
        "56. Calls on the Commission and the Member States under the programme to improve law-making to cooperate constantly with the social partners,and where appropriate otherrelevant, representative civil society bodies on any legislation in the labour law or social policy fields;with a view to simplifying administrative proceduresfacing small and medium-sized (ex 297)enterprisesand new firmsin particular, making their financial situation easier to increase their competitivenessin order to create jobs;\n",
        "57. Calls on the Commission to regulate joint and several liability for general or principal undertakings, in order to deal with abuses in the subcontracting and outsourcing of workers and to set up a transparent and competitive market for all companies on the basis of a level playing field regarding respect for labour standards and working conditions, in particular calls on the Commission and the Member States to clearly establish at European level who is responsible for compliance with labour law and for paying the associated wages, social security contributions and taxes in a chain of subcontractors;\n",
        "58. Expresses its deep conviction that creating insecure, poorly-paid jobs is not an appropriate response to the relocation trend affecting more and more sectors; considers, on the contrary, that it is investment in research, development, training and life-long learning which will be able to boost those sectors which are currently suffering from a lack of competitiveness;\n",
        "59. Calls on the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a dispute settlement system, to enable the European agreements between social partners to develop into an effective and flexible tool that can foster a more effective regulatory approach at European level;\n",
        "60. Calls on the Member States to remove the restrictions on access to their labour markets and thus improve worker mobility within the EU, thereby enabling the goals of the Single Market and the Lisbon Strategy to be achieved more swiftly;\n",
        "61. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the Parliaments of the Member States and candidate countries. .\n"
