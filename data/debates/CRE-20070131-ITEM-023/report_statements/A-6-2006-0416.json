        "25.    Points out the vital need for the accurate evaluation of statistical data on gender issues, as well as on other aspects of multiple discrimination such as ethnicity, particularly given that there is not always statistically differentiated data on gender relating to children and young people; considers that this should be one of the tasks of, among others, the new Institute for Gender Equality;\n",
