{"speaker": "Anna Záborská (PPE-DE).", "english": "Anna Záborská (PPE-DE). – ( SK ) We often come across the opinion that maternity and family are natural and even insuperable obstacles that prevent many women from gaining higher education and academic degrees, or pursuing lifelong education. Are they really obstacles? Yes, they are. However, these are obstacles resulting from our way of life and it is possible to overcome them.\nI am a physician and a mother. I know that studying medicine is a life-long challenge. Furthermore, I am aware of how much time and energy women dedicate to their families and children. But I also know that women can make outstanding physicians. I would like every young woman to be able to opt freely to study medicine if she feels it is her duty to heal others. I would like her to be able to decide in the full knowledge that in the future she will make a good physician and a good wife and mother at the same time. The report on the discrimination against young women and girls in the field of education deals with these issues as well. It points out the fact that the values of family and maternity should not be at odds with those of education. Maternity is the natural mission and desire of every woman. Unless we manage to harmonise the roles of women as mothers and professionals in everyday life, the European promise of equal opportunities will remain hollow.\nI would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to my fellow MEP, Mrs Flasarová. Together with my colleagues from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we greatly appreciate her work on this report. We unanimously supported her in the Committee on Women’s Rights, and I would like to call on the plenary to approve this report as well.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Anna Záborská (PPE-DE). – ( SK ) We often come across the opinion that maternity and family are natural and even insuperable obstacles that prevent many women from gaining higher education and academic degrees, or pursuing lifelong education.
