Only rarely do journalists ask successful men in their interviews, ‘How do you manage to balance your career with the need to take care of the family?’ – and certainly not as often as they ask successful women. It is considered quite normal that in most cases it is the woman who sacrifices her career and gives precedence to the family. In some cases child care is a factor that diminishes the interest of women in continuing their education. Many women interrupt their studies due to maternity, and subsequently give up the idea of further education.\nIt is surprising that, while at the beginning of higher education programmes women outnumber men by a ratio of 59% to 41%, only 43% manage to gain a master's degree and a mere 15% achieve the level of professorship. In this context I welcome Mrs Flasarova’s report, which provides a detailed analysis of the levels of education achieved by women and their chances of placement in the labour market. At the same time the report focuses on specific elements of discrimination against young women and girls in the area of education. Education is a basic right and a key instrument of social integration. It is a recipe for dealing with poverty, especially for women coming from vulnerable social groups.\nI therefore consider it important that the education programmes funded by the European Union are implemented and made use of, as they will serve to increase awareness of gender issues and of equal access to education at all levels. In conclusion, I would like to call on Member States to facilitate women’s access to education through flexible education programmes, for example, by means of computer-assisted correspondence courses, and to thus ensure the better integration of women into society.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zita Pleštinská (PPE-DE). – ( SK ) We may attribute it to the mass media, but gender stereotypes determine in advance the roles of men and women in society.
