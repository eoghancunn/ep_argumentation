If we look at the D-mark period of 1948 to 1998, the price stability track record of the ECB is actually better than that of the D-mark, which used to be the global benchmark. I think you have delivered a very good result on that front. But I am also equally happy that you, President Trichet, referred to financial stability. This is also in the Treaty mandate of the ECB, and I think that the ECB’s role in financial supervision should be strengthened.\nTommaso Padoa-Schioppa’s ‘twin peaks’ model is very enchanting, and I think that it is now up to the Member States and the Council to take this model, to have more of a role in the ECB for financial stability supervision. In the European Parliament the Van den Burg-Dăianu report about this is currently being drawn up. It has a lot of good points which you can also use in your work when we try to deliver better financial stability supervision in Europe.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I think it is absolutely amazing how the ECB has delivered the main point of the mandate: price stability.
