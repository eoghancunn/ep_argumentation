    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Urges that resolute action be taken to reduce the most acute development shortfalls in the poorest EU regions, and notes in particular that the new Member States, which have come under cohesion policy since 2004, require special support owing to their ongoing institutional, administrative and economic difficulties;\n",
        "2.  Stresses the importance of analysing historical developments in the cohesion countries of EU-15; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States concerned, their regions, local authorities and other interested parties, to clearly highlight on one hand growth generating measures in successful regions (such as Ireland) and on the other hand the main obstacles in the regions lagging behind, so that the impediments do not arise again in the regions of the new Member States;\n",
        "3.  Draws the attention of the Commission and the Member States to the situation of regions which, despite being the poorest in EU-15 and despite the lack of improvement in their development data, are no longer considered the poorest regions of EU-27 for purely statistical reasons; recommends that consideration be given to the specific situation of those regions;\n",
        "4.  Takes the view that funding uptake difficulties are a major and pressing concern, particularly for the new Member States, which are finding it difficult to satisfy complicated cohesion policy requirements and often lack sufficient own contribution (private or public) capital to pre-finance Community grants, because of the procedural difficulties and time restrictions involved in implementing projects, as a result of which potential beneficiaries are unable to obtain or even claim funds which they could put to good use;\n",
        "5.  Is concerned that in some regions Community assistance is poorly targeted, with the result that the situation in those regions fails to improve despite many years of funding and that Community resources are squandered;\n",
        "6.  Suggests that EU cohesion policy should take due account of the diversity of the needs of the poorest regions, with aid being tailored to their specific features and conditions and their potential being exploited, so as to implement projects that produce lasting results and genuine development on the basis of multiannual development plans taking due account of spatial development plans;\n",
        "7.  Recommends that EUcohesion policy of the EU be adapted to the outermost regions as referred to in Article 299 (2) through special, specific measures;supports the strategy deployed by the EU to help its outermost regions, and calls on the Commission rapidly to give details of the substance of the ‘stronger partnership’ that it has announced, particularly with regard to improving the competitiveness of the outermost regions and its action plan for the wider neighbourhood;\n",
        "8.  Recommends that, with a view to speeding up economic growth, further investment and balanced sustainable development in the poorest regions, regions and Member States give priority to projects designed to make regions more accessible by providing them with basic infrastructure, particularly in the transport and ITC fields, having due regard for the social and environmental impact of such projects;\n",
        "9.  Calls on Member States and regional and local authorities to take due account of the need for balanced development within individual regions when planning future regional development programmes; believes it particularly important for account to be taken of the specific needs of urban areas, with an appropriate urban policy including a housing policy for 'poor neighbourhoods', and for an appropriate rural policy to be pursued;\n",
        "10. Believes it is particularly important to attribute more competences in cohesion policy to cities so that they can react in partnership to the specific needs of urban areas; in this context calls on the Commission and Member States to fully exploit the potential of integrated development plans where cohesion policy can directly be linked with town planning;\n",
        "11. Encourages Member States to make the poorest regions more attractive to investors by drawing on those regions' natural and cultural assets in order to develop traditional forms of economic activity specific to each region and to create new forms of economic activity; accordingly urges the Commission to concentrate more on identifying and supporting measures to conserve the specific skills and customs still surviving in isolated regions of Europe which are lagging behind;\n",
        "12. Welcomes the focus on using cohesion policy to enhance the Community's innovation capacity over the period 2007 to 2013; notes that this objective should also apply to the poorest regions; places particular emphasis on the need to reduce the technology gap within and between regions and Member States by bolstering technological cooperation networks;\n",
        "13. Reminds the Commission and the Member States that any assessment of cohesion policy should lead to improved innovative cohesion policy in any enlarged Union of the future; recalls the need to focus on new concepts of territorial development and more specific ideas for supporting the development of regional critical mass surrounding urban areas and other regional clusters; also recalls the need to use a differentiated approach to the use of Structural Funds specific to the needs of all regions;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission and Member States to support projects that increase regional capacity to generate and absorb new technologies, particularly those relating to environmental protection and the development of natural resources and involving the dissemination of models based on lower energy consumption and the use of renewable energies, so that the regions can develop a lead in eco-innovation without having to endure negative non-sustainable development aspects experienced by other regions in their development cycle;\n",
        "15. Stresses the importance of territorial cooperation (cross-border, transnational and interregional) in the context of the EU's cohesion policy in order to promote balanced development; encourages in this regard the setting up of regional and sectoral cooperation networks, involving, especially the poorest regions;\n",
        "16. Encourages the Commission, Member States and local authorities to promote entrepreneurship in the poorest regions by means of an integrated system of economic and social incentives for investors, and draws attention to the need for significant simplification of administrative procedures, particularly in relation to the setting up of new, and expansion of existing, economic activities;\n",
        "17. Encourages Member States to promote entrepreneurship in schools and to support training schemes for future entrepreneurs, aimed in particular at young people, women, elderly persons and minorities exposed to social exclusion;\n",
        "18. Welcomes new instruments such as the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) and Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA) initiatives; nevertheless points to the fact that these instruments came late to be fully utilised and that awareness of their possibilities at local and regional level is still very low; notes the pressing need for such instruments to be disseminated and applied as widely as possible in the Member States, and applied in accordance with the actual situation in those States, with account being taken of the real needs of the potential beneficiaries and their capacity in practical terms to make use of these instruments;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to step up efforts to provide technical assistance to Member States and regions by setting up an appropriate training programme; welcomes the Joint Assistance in Supporting Projects in European Regions (JASPERS) initiative to provide assistance in implementing large projects;\n",
        "20. Welcomes the recently introduced 'Regions for economic change' initiative and the commitment expressed therein to disseminating best practices that, in the past, have had a clearly positive impact and have contributed to regional economic growth; calls, accordingly, on the Commission to ensure that the poorest EU regions are included in the best-practice exchange network, while also describing such practices on a public website in all official EU languages;\n",
        "21. Encourages Member States to set up public-private partnerships (PPPs) as an effective means of involving private capital in the funding of regional projects; suggests, in this connection, that simple and transparent rules governing the setting up of such partnerships should be laid down given their long-term impact on public finances;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission to step up its effort to make directives, rules and guidelines easier to understand, with a view to preventing misinterpretation and to facilitating programme implementation;\n",
        "23. Encourages the Member States and the Community institutions further to simplify procedures with a view to ensuring that funds are allocated in a transparent and efficient manner and delivered swiftly to final beneficiaries; in this context also suggests that the concept of single contacting points be fully exploited and that control procedures on the use of funds be strengthened; also encourages Member States to comply with the European Transparency Initiative and the responsibility of the managing authority for organising the publication, electronically or otherwise, of the list of beneficiaries, the names of the operations and the amount of public funding allocated to operations, as laid down in Article 7(2)(d) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006[7]of 8 December 2006;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Member States to ensure effective political, technical and administrative coordination and effective compliance with the partnership principle aimed at the sound management of funds; expresses concern at the lack of properly functioning coordination and partnership mechanisms in the poorest regions;\n",
        "25. Draws the attention of the Commission and the Member States to the fact that, with a view to securing balanced development, synergies need to be established between economic, social and environmental aspects, drawing on an analysis of the reasons for economic backwardness, with particular reference to unemployment and its underlying structures, especially in the poorest regions;\n",
        "26. Stresses that the unemployment rate in some of the poorest EU regions is higher than 20%; expresses concern at the fact that unemployment is a problem that affects the poorest regions in particular and remains higher among women and minorities exposed to social exclusion ; calls on Member States to provide support for women on the labour market and to even out pay disparities between women and men; calls furthermore for attention to be given to very specific situation of the Roma population, for which the problem of long-term unemployment is critical;\n",
        "27. Stresses the need for the European Social Fund to be put to good use, investing in human capital in the poorest regions by ensuring better education provision and steadily increasing qualification levels, particularly among young people, women and the elderly, and minorities exposed to social exclusion, and by investing in accompanying actions and relevant support and community and care services that improve employment opportunities;\n",
        "28. Stresses that equal opportunities for women and men should be promoted at all stages of the formulation and implementation of projects coming within the sphere of EU cohesion policy;\n",
        "29. Notes that 2007 has been designated European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and calls on the Commission and Member States to promote projects to raise awareness of gender mainstreaming in all Community programmes, particularly those with an impact on economic and social cohesion;\n",
        "30. Calls on the Commission to improve the system used to assess cohesion policy, and to devise a new means of measuring regional development, based not just on GDP but also on other indicators such as unemployment rates and other quantitative and qualitative indicators, whilst improving the methodology for the calculation of Power Purchasing Parities, namely through the development of regional rather than national indicators;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission to provide it, on a regular basis, with up-to-date, reliable and comparable statistics enabling it to accurately assess progress in the development of the poorest EU regions;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission to analyse the impact of cohesion policy and look into the causes of any undesirable outcomes arising from Community policies in its 2009 mid-term review of the Community budget and in the next report on economic and social cohesion, with a view to ensuring that cohesion policy is as effective as possible throughout the 2007-2013 programming period;\n",
        "33. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
