{"speaker": "Stavros Dimas,", "english": "Stavros Dimas, Μember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, I thank the Members of Parliament for their very important speeches and for their contribution to this evening's debate. In closing this debate, I should like to say that the Community initiative in the sector in question is extremely important.\nAs Mr Bradbourn said, aviation is a global sector and, as such, responsibility for the matters in question must lie with the International Civil Aviation Organization, and account must be taken of scientific results and scientific proof and of the very important study carried out by the House of Lords committee, which I too have seen. Without doubt, we shall have a full impact study to support our legislative proposal.\nI should also like to say that there is excellent cooperation between the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization. On the question of climate change, in particular, we must take action at European Union level, including for the simple reason that the European Union agreed in the Sixth Community Action Programme that it must determine, propose and take measures if the International Civil Aviation Organization failed to propose the relevant measures by 2002. This deadline expired a long time ago. Consequently, we must take action and, as I said earlier, the European Council called on the Commission last December to submit the relevant legislative proposal under the codecision procedure.\nIn all events, the action we are examining will not contradict the European Union's commitments towards the International Civil Aviation Organization, given that the Civil Aviation Organization itself is in favour of an open system of emissions trading; in other words, it has accepted that emissions from international aviation will come under the current national systems of emissions trading rights.\nOur proposal moves in precisely this direction. Last year, as you know, the Community trading rights system was put into practice. This is the first and the largest international trading system and now, of course, is the best time for us to extend it by including aviation in a way that is compatible with the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nThe European Union accounts for approximately 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions by international aviation, compared with Annex I countries, in other words countries which have restrictions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. Consequently, the measure recommended by the Commission will doubtless have important repercussions. We hope that this example will be followed by other countries.\nFinally, I should also like to refer to the concerns expressed to the effect that our proposal will put European companies at a disadvantage, compared with companies in third countries. This is not the case; there is no such risk because, under the Commission proposal, the trading system will cover all airlines operating flights in the geographical area, within the geographical scope of the system, irrespective of nationality.\nThis means, therefore, that airlines in the European Union will be treated in exactly the same way as their foreign competitors. I hope that plenary will approve the motion and support the Commission's proposals.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Stavros Dimas, Μember of the Commission.
