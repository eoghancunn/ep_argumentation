However, there is sufficient evidence in the public domain that appears to contradict what is called for as a solution in this report.\nAs Mrs Doyle mentioned, the UK House of Lords recently finalised a report on the effects of aviation on climate change. As she said, it states that the effect would be insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years. Commissioner, Mrs Lucas, I have a copy of that report with me tonight. I would very much welcome your views on its contents.\nSimilarly, as Mrs Doyle mentioned, figures published by IATA show that over the last 40 years, through technological development, aircraft are 70% more fuel efficient. I have no doubt that such technological advances will continue to improve the situation. We can already see that in the new generation of aircraft: the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787. Given those two factors I suspect that the report’s author is more guilty of wishful thinking than scientific fact.\nOne of my main concerns when addressing the topic is that Europe tries to act alone, making decisions which could potentially place EU airlines at a competitive disadvantage. There are international organisations – one of which is the International Civil Aviation Organization – that regulate the industry at a global level. I believe any action that is necessary should be taken at that level. In my view what is needed is incontrovertible scientific evidence, not speculation. That is why I support a full impact assessment being carried out before any proposals are brought forward.\nWe must be careful in the messages that we send out, not only to the aviation industry, which contributes greatly to all our countries’ economies, but also to our citizens, who I believe have the right to continue to enjoy affordable air travel, whether on business or for pleasure.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bradbourn (PPE-DE). – Mr President, when it comes to the environment, aviation always seems to me to be the easiest target to blame for emissions.
