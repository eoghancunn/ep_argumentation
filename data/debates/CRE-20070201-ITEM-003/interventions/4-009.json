{"speaker": "Charlie McCreevy,", "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the excellent work done in the preparation of the report on the European private company statute on which you will vote today. My departments are already studying in detail the suggestions and recommendations proposed in this report.\nWe need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business. It is important to take action that will help small and medium firms to reap fully the benefits of the single market.\nThe growth of small businesses is crucial for the competitiveness of the European economy. One means of facilitating the expansion of small businesses is to simplify the current legal framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burdens. These burdens are particularly onerous for SMEs that do not have big legal departments at their disposal. That is why I have decided to present a communication on the simplification of EU company law in the spring of this year. This fits in with the broader programme of the Commission on simplification of the acquis communautaire which provides for a 25% reduction in administrative burdens by 2012.\nI am all for initiatives that will give European firms, and in particular small and medium companies, a flexible regulatory framework. The European private company statute could be a useful option for them in this respect. The idea was supported by industry in the recent public consultation on future priorities for the action plan on company law and corporate governance. Many respondents stressed that such an option would create more choice for companies and reduce compliance costs for firms which wish to operate in several Member States. However, a number of our respondents also questioned the usefulness of such a measure and, as you know, in accordance with better regulation principles the Commission must carry out an impact assessment before any initiative is proposed. Accordingly, my departments are now examining the costs and benefits of such a statute, as well as alternative measures to address the problems at stake. I would only propose a European private company statute if the impact assessment clearly shows that this is the most appropriate instrument to tackle the problems SMEs face today and that the European private company form would be useful to them in expanding their activities and developing their businesses across borders.\nExperience with the European company statute has shown that creating a new European corporate form can be a very long and complex process. The end result may be legal instruments that are not always easy to use. If a European private company statute is to be worthwhile, then agreement would need to be found swiftly. The end result would have to be simple for SMEs to use, thereby bringing real added value.\nI note that your report and associated resolution are based on Article 192 of the Treaty calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal. Under the framework agreement, the Commission undertook to take account of any such request made pursuant to Article 192 of the Treaty. I intend to live up to these commitments. We will assess the practical suggestions set out in the report in detail. I want my departments to take the time necessary to consider carefully all possible options in order to provide the best balanced solution for SMEs. Upon conclusion of the impact assessment, I will report back to you on its results and the policy conclusions we draw from it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission .
