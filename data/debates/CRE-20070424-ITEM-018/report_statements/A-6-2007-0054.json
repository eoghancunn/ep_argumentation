    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Takes reluctantly note ofthe communication from the Commission, and regrets the lack of a clear vision on how to meet the overall objective; considers that it should be seen as a first step in a process eventually leading to a comprehensive strategy for the sustainable use of natural resources;\n",
        "2.  Considers that the Commission's action platform for the study of the sustainable development strategy is too cautious and limited in scope and that, in its present form, it will not be able to persuade the public or political decision-makers to pursue the crucial goals for which it provides;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission to establish goals and targets at political and at sectoral level for resource efficiency, and speed up the work on appropriate tools to maintain progress;\n",
        "4.  Notes with regret that the Thematic Strategy fails to pursue the objectives of the European Community's 6th EAP; considers that the objectives of the 6th EAP relating to the sustainable use of natural resources will remain unattained unless the concerted actions presented in the Thematic Strategy are made more effective; considers that this particularly applies to the objective of ensuring that the use of natural resources and their impact do not exceed the carrying capacity of the environment;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the European Union to step up its efforts and take decisions with a view to becoming the most efficient  economy in the world in terms of its use of resources and energy; stresses that the attainment of such aims would permit greater independence and security of supply of resources and energy and a decoupling of economic growth from the exploitation of natural resources;\n",
        "6.  Stresses that pollution, the increasing scarcity of natural resources and raw materials and the increasing difficulty of gaining access to them constitute a threat to the conservation of biodiversity and will cause price rises on such a scale as to more or less completely destabilise the economic and social systems of the European Union and third countries, and will give rise to risks of conflict; urges the Commission and the European Union to respond in ways commensurate with the situation;\n",
        "7.  Considers that, even if there is a need for more specific data in certain fields, this should not be taken as an excuse for postponing measures which need to be taken to ensure sustainable use of natural resources; notes, furthermore, that the knowledge currently available is sufficient to permit practical action to be taken now to improve the sustainable consumption of natural resources;\n",
        "8.Stresses theessentialobjectives of sustainable use of natural resources, including a high level of protection of the environment and public health, the availability of natural resources for future generations, a contribution to the stability and prosperity of our economic and social system and limiting the use of resources in order to reduce and stabilise environmental impact;\n",
        "9.  Considers that the Commission should take Parliament, European public opinion and the environment seriously, and calls on the Commission to set binding targets and timetables for natural resources in the following way: (a) to develop and implement best practices for every production chain, (b) to achieve a quantitative greenhouse gas reduction of at least 30% by 2020 and of 80% by 2050 against 1990 levels\n",
        "10. Encourages the Commission to define best practices for the major product groups, starting with the ‘top-ten’ (defined by the Commission), to be completed within three years. The Data Centre for Natural Resources (proposed in the Thematic Strategy) shall be responsible for defining best practices;\n",
        "11. Encourages the Commission to propose Community policies in order to: ●foster stakeholder interaction and promote application of life-cycle assessments (LCA) and/or other methods among companies and provide information upon request, ●develop CO2targets on a national and a sectoral basis;\n",
        "12. Considers that the strategy should include guidelines explaining the necessary measures for certain sectors and required changes proposed for policies to reach a sustainable or more efficient resource use;\n",
        "13. Considers that, by postponing practical action, the EU will surrender its competitive position in the field of innovation and trade in new eco-efficient technologies;\n",
        "14. Considers that the European Union should take the lead in the search for innovative solutions and in promoting more efficient use of resources, and that it should aim to be the world leader in eco-efficient technologies; notes that the market for sustainable products will have to grow in order to meet the increasing demand from a rapidly growing 'middle class' for consumer goods and services which respect regional and global carrying capacity;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the acknowledgement by the Commission that policy on the sustainable use of natural resources has so far proven inadequate;\n",
        "16. While acknowledging that working towards the sustainable use of natural resources is a long-term process, considers that a time horizon of 25 years as outlined in the Commission's communication is too long;\n",
        "17. Welcomes the Commission's focus on life-cycle thinking throughout the Communication and encourages the Commission to follow this approach through to concrete policy action;\n",
        "18. Stresses that R&D efforts must be geared towards enhancing our understanding of how natural systems work so as to structure production and consumption systems along biological lines, thereby improving resource productivity and reducing pollution;\n",
        "19. Considers the establishment of a European Data Centre before 2008 to be useful if its remit is to periodically assess and optimise the known indicators and in addition to establish which further indicators are still needed to facilitate the pursuit of the urgent objective of reducing the environmental and health impact of the use of natural resources to a minimum;\n",
        "20. Does not agree with the Commission that no indicators are known which would enable specific, clear and time-tabled objectives to be included in the strategy now; notes that indicators which are already known include GDP (Gross Domestic Product), DMI (Direct Material Input) and DMC (Domestic Material Consumption); other indicators as available and detailed as the ones mentioned above would be related to various aspects of the quality of life, such as public health conditions, social inclusion, social awareness of  decision-making processes and an environmental \"footprint\";  the challenge would be to improve the quality of life by pursuing more immaterial goals with the support of information and communication technologies, and in general less demanding technologies, and therefore reducing the pressure on natural resources;\n",
        "21. Proposes that the Commission perform within three years an assessment regarding the possibilities and the instruments for decoupling natural resource use from economic growth. The revised strategy should include these decoupling instruments. This approach should also be implemented in the revision of existing policies;\n",
        "22. Stresses the need to develop a complement to the GDP - focusing on the qualitative aspects of growth - and in this process specifically develop methodologies to assign a value to natural capital;\n",
        "23. Considers that, if reductions in the use of natural resources are accompanied by a switch to an alternative, research should first be conducted into the environmental impact of the alternative in question;\n",
        "24. Calls on the EU to ensure that all Community instruments and legislation contribute overall to the conservation of natural resources and the pursuit of sustainable development in the EU and countries outside the EU; the EU should encourage the establishment of  resource strategies in non-EU countries, which should also be reflected in its funds and aid policy;\n",
        "25. Considers it important to tackle not only Community use (use within the EU) of natural resources but also imports of resources from third countries; would consider it unacceptable for a reduction in the use of Community resources to lead to imports of resources from outside the Community by way of compensation;\n",
        "26. Stresses the need to address the obvious shortcomings of the current economic model with regard to assigning a value to ecosystem services, and to present a policy framework giving priority to resource efficiency and production systems progressively structured along biological lines;\n",
        "27. Considers that by 2030 the use of primary non-renewable resources in the EU must be reduced by a factor of 4, or the use of natural resources must be halved by 2030 while simultaneously increasing worldwide prosperity; notes that the following indicators can be used: TMR (Total Material Requirement), DMI (Direct Material Input) en DMC (Direct Material Consumption); notes that these indicators show what quantities of resources are used in an economy and that by dividing GDP by these indicators it is possible to measure the productivity of natural resource use;\n",
        "28. Agrees that at present there  are very few aggregated impact indicators that are already widely accepted for measuring the progress of reductions in the environmental impact of resource use, the so-called eco-efficiency indicator; considers that these need to be finalised as soon as possible and at the latest by 2008; notes that in this respect the further development of “environmentally weighted material consumption” (EMC) should be actively supported;\n",
        "29. Considers that market instruments and subsidies, particularly of a fiscal nature, can be used to reduce the use of environmentally damaging resources, particularly by means of a reallocation of subsidies and by reducing in stages, but quickly, any subsidies to unsustainable activities and supporting the introduction of ecotaxes. Abolishing harmful subsidies on resource use should be incorporated in the Commissions preparation of a roadmap as demanded in the SDS;\n",
        "30. Considers that a reallocation of subsidies, for example more subsidies for small-scale hydroelectric power, as well as for wind power and solar energy, would promote the use of new technologies and improve Europe's competitive position in the world, as well as reducing dependence on fossil fuels imported from other parts of the world;\n",
        "31. Notes that the decoupling of economic growth and improvement of the efficiency of resource use is already regarded as a political objective in nine Member States (including Germany and Finland) and Japan; considers  that  relative decoupling is not sufficient, given that absolute consumption of natural resources remains too high; stresses therefore that a political programme relating to the sustainable use of natural resources should concentrate on decoupling of economic growth from the use of natural resources that brings about an absolute reduction both in the resources used and in the environmental impact of resource use;\n",
        "32. Stresses that the EU should adopt a clear target for the absolute reduction of resource use,  given that the analysis in the Annex to the Commission’s Resources Strategy Communication indicates that we need to go beyond a 3% annual resource efficiency improvement, and that halving resource use in the period 2005-2030 requires almost 6% annual resource efficiency improvement;\n",
        "33. Considers that the adverse impact of the total use of resources in the EU per category of resource must be halved, for example by means of a sectoral approach in the construction industry, transport and other sectors, in order to reduce the impact of the use of these resources and dependence on them;\n",
        "34. Considers that the strategy should aim to make more efficient use of natural resources, improve their management and the management of waste, adopt more sustainable methods of production and patterns of consumption, and ensure that the use of natural resources does not exceed the potential burden which the environment can withstand;\n",
        "35. Proposes that targets be set for resource use reduction in the following sectors: food, housing and transport, as according to recent studies these cause the highest negative impacts;\n",
        "36. Therefore calls on the Commission to undertake three key actions: 1) identify and develop specific policies and actions for the top 20 resources (materials) with the largest impacts; these should be proposed at the latest by 2008, 2) prepare stakeholder dialogues on  the most resource-intensive extraction and production sectors in order to identify sectoral targets and appropriate measures for improving resource efficiency, 3) develop benchmark criteria for sustainable management and harvesting of biotic resources (eg wood, fish, agricultural products);\n",
        "37. Calls on the Commission to actively encourage the development of new models of offering products through, for example, product service systems, providing utility to consumers through the use of services rather than products, thereby optimising the use of both energy and materials;\n",
        "38. Stresses that efforts to use natural resources more efficiently must be implemented with full attention being paid to the impact of trade and have as a goal to progressively reduce the ecological footprint of the EU in the world;\n",
        "39. Considers that the strategy should be integrated at various levels of policy and across all relevant policy areas; to this end EU waste prevention and recycling targets must play a fundamental role;\n",
        "40. Supports the Strategy’s approach to analyse existing policies to raise the Strategy’s effectiveness, but proposes to select already in this phase the most relevant existing  policies and the ones under preparation (e.g.: Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste,  Integrated Product Policy). The Strategy should be consistent with the Lisbon objectives as well;\n",
        "41. Proposes the identification of the deficiencies in current European policies which hamper the sustainable use of natural resources;\n",
        "42. Notes that the Commission envisages a regular review of the Thematic Strategy beginning in 2010 and continuing every five years thereafter. Considers this to be of value but stresses the need for this review to include proper analysis of actions taken towards achieving the sustainable use of natural resources and to take into account the constant need for policy in this area to evolve in relation to scientific developments. The review should also examine the effects in third countries of actions taken at EU level;\n",
        "43. Considers that agricultural policy, in particular, should be geared partly to reducing pressure on the environment by means of the sustainable use of natural resources including, but not confined to, land, water and fuels;\n",
        "44. Stresses the importance of the global dimension of European policy on the sustainable use of natural resources and the need to ensure that any move towards sustainable resource use in Europe does not lead to increased environmental impacts in third countries;\n",
        "45. Considers that, in agriculture, genuine progress needs to be made in research into ecological production methods, regulation and monitoring relating, inter alia, to the use of fertilisers, pesticides and water, promotion of short chains, internalising external costs and attaching environmental conditions to economic support;\n",
        "46. Considers that the pioneering role and responsible use of natural resources in organic and sustainable farming should be acknowledged and supported;\n",
        "47. Considers that sustainable agriculture deserves protection and that by means of international trade agreements the poorest countries in particular should be given the right to protect their own markets against cheap imports; notes that direct support for exports of agricultural products has an extremely deleterious effect on the economy in such poor countries and thus discourages sustainable use of natural resources;\n",
        "48. Considers that farmers' organisations and other organisations which promote sustainable agriculture and food should be able to assume an active role in formulating agricultural policy;\n",
        "49. Considers that long-distance transport in particular, for example of agricultural products, retail goods and chemicals, is undesirable because of the  high CO2emissions involved;\n",
        "50. Considers that, as various fish species are currently among the most threatened long-term resources, and as the disappearance of species may result in further ecological changes, a responsible and strict fisheries policy is called for;\n",
        "51. Considers that the Member States must implement the EU's biodiversity strategy, both in fisheries and in other fields, and, in cooperation with the Commission, must take measures to attain the objective of halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010;\n",
        "52. Welcomes the proposal for the international panel which will include participants from developing countries and which will, inter alia, develop sustainability benchmarks for extracting, harvesting and transporting materials and products coming from outside the EU, including  not only material quality standards but also production quality standards, taking account of social and environmental issues;\n",
        "53. Stresses the need for aid to developing countries, to non-EU Eastern European and West Balkan countries,) by means of, but not confined to, sharing technology and know-how; adds that Europe cannot decently import biocapacity from other countries without the sustainable use of resources likewise becoming an objective for those countries and without ensuring that it is not importing resources which are over-exploited or threatened;\n",
        "54. Considers that developing countries should be helped to meet EU standards and labelling requirements;\n",
        "55. Stresses the importance to this strategy of the requirement already incorporated in other policy strategies that by 2010 an average of 12% of energy consumption within the EU and 21% of electricity consumption within the EU should be derived from sustainable natural resources, and that the lower of these figures should rise to 15% by 2015;\n",
        "56. Aims  to align the EU norm for green public procurement with the standard currently achieved by the Member State which performs best;\n",
        "57. Considers, in line with policy on renewable energy consumption, that by 2010 an average of at least 12% of the renewable raw materials used in the EU should be derived from sources which are demonstrably managed sustainably, a figure which should rise to at least 15% in 2015;at the same time underlines the importance of the EU target of 20% energy savings by 2020;\n",
        "58. Considers that the EU should do everything possible to provide consumers and producers with proper information on the sustainableuse of natural resources, that environmental education, particularly concerning sustainable consumption, should form part of elementary education, and that consumers and producers should be involved in ideas concerning changes which could lead to sustainable use of natural resources;\n",
        "59. Considers that producers should supply information to the public on the origin and production methods of their products and services and the production chains involved, including information about the environmental impact throughout the cycle through which the product and the resources used in the production process pass;\n",
        "60. Considers that EU policy should be so framed as to encourage Member States to adopt more ambitious approaches – and certainly not discourage them from doing so – with a view to improving the sustainable use of natural resources;\n",
        "61. Considers that the Commission should submit by 2008 a roadmap for reform, per sector, of subsidy schemes which have a substantial adverse impact on the environment and are difficult to reconcile with sustainable development, with a view to their gradual abolition;\n",
        "62. Welcomes any Commission initiatives which could result in the sustainable use of natural resources and reduce the adverse impact of the use of natural resources on the environment;\n",
        "63. Draws attention to the need to improve communication between retailers and consumers; calls on the Commission in this connection to extend the present energy label (refrigerators, cars, buildings) to all product groups by 2010;\n",
        "64. Proposes that the Commission develop, within three years, a methodology to measure the environmental impact of every production chain;\n",
        "65. Proposes that the Commission monitor on a three-yearly basis the progress in improving resource efficiency;\n",
        "66. Recommends using the international panel (proposed in the Thematic Strategy) to extend best practices and CO2targets to global level;\n",
        "67. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
