{"speaker": "Gyula Hegyi,", "english": "Gyula Hegyi, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, we have inherited natural resources from nature or the Creator, but we are responsible for them with regard to future generations. We hear increasingly varying information on the threat to the balance of nature. Two-thirds of the ecosystems on which human beings depend are in decline. Europe’s demand on natural resources has risen by almost 70% since the early 1960s. This dangerous trend must be stopped.\nWe want economic growth, because many people are still in need, but without increasing the use of natural resources and with less environmental impact. This decoupling of economic growth and the increasing use of natural resources is the main message of this report. The strategy proposed by the Commission is rather weak and has no deadlines or targets. That is why I tabled around 25 amendments on behalf of the PSE Group. I am happy that all but one of them has found favour with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.\nMy fellow parliamentarians and I have proposed concrete targets to improve our commitment to the future. I propose specific targets regarding food, housing and the transport sector. In a market economy, taxation is the proper tool for regulating the use of resources. That is why it is so important to set up a European eco-taxation system. This report should be followed by specific regulations and directives to stop the self-destructive over-use of natural resources.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gyula Hegyi, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, we have inherited natural resources from nature or the Creator, but we are responsible for them with regard to future generations.
