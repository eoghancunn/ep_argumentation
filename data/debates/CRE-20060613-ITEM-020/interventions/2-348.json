{"speaker": "Tatjana Ždanoka (Verts/ALE),", "english": "Tatjana Ždanoka (Verts/ALE), rapporteur . – Mr President, the report on the framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, which has been adopted by an overwhelming majority of the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is a synthesis of the efforts of all those involved, including the representatives of all the large political groups.\nI am very grateful to my shadow rapporteurs, and to other colleagues, for their constructive suggestions. I hope that the proposals we have drawn up in the framework strategy for providing the equal and effective participation of all persons in the economic, social and political life of Europe will become the key factor to overcoming the recent negative tendencies which are undermining the prospects for the sustainable development of Europe in the 21st century.\nIgnorance of the multicultural and multiethnic nature of modern societies leads to dangerous social tensions. The ethnic, social and linguistic diversity of European society should be perceived not only as a challenge for sustainable development but also as a source of creative potential and for the dynamic stability of modern Europe.\nWhat are the key elements of the framework strategy? Firstly, there are different ways of understanding the concept of discrimination, depending on whether it is viewed from an individual or collective point of view. At the same time, upholding the rights of citizens as individuals does not require the same action as upholding the interests of groups of individuals. We therefore stress the need to adopt specific measures intended to prevent or to compensate for the disadvantages linked to one of the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty. Such measures should be extended to all sectors in which serious inequalities are found, whether in education, healthcare, housing, access to goods and services, or any other area.\nSecondly, the detection of indirect forms of discrimination must be based upon reliable statistics relating in particular to certain groups with special characteristics. There is no conflict between personal data protection and the monitoring of discrimination through statistical means, insofar as the objective of such monitoring is to gain a better understanding of the over- or under-representation of certain groups in particular sectors or at certain levels and to measure progress in order to identify the need to act and to select the most effective course of action.\nWe also stress the need for supplementary legislation. We greatly regret the fact that, despite repeated requests from the European Parliament, the Commission does not intend at this stage to come forward with further legislative proposals based on Article 13. We insist that a new legislative tool, incorporating all the forms of discrimination set out in Article 13, and having the same scope as Directive 2000/43/EC, be submitted before mid-2007.\nWe also call upon the Commission to take urgent action against Member States that have failed to transpose Community law prohibiting discrimination, considering that new Member States which have not transposed the anti-discrimination directives must be subject to infringement proceedings in the same way as the established Member States.\nWe also ask Member States to take on obligations, without any reservations or restrictive declarations, under human rights treaties in the field of non-discrimination and the protection of persons belonging to minorities, as well as to honour such obligations in good faith.\nWe consider that traditional national minorities urgently need to be protected by various forms of self-government or autonomy in order to overcome the double standards arising from the Copenhagen criteria, on the one hand, and the lack of any rules in the Member States, on the other.\nI am convinced that the European Union must in fact have one of the most advanced framework policies in the world for combating discrimination.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Tatjana Ždanoka (Verts/ALE), rapporteur . – Mr President, the report on the framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, which has been adopted by an overwhelming majority of the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is a synthesis of the efforts of all those involved, including the representatives of all the large political groups.\nI am very grateful to my shadow rapporteurs, and to other colleagues, for their constructive suggestions.
