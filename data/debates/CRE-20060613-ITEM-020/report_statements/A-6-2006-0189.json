    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Considers that, in addition to legislative tools and means of redress, the fight against discrimination must of necessity be based on education, the promotion of best practices and campaigns targeting the general public and those areas and sectors where discrimination takes place; stresses that the fight against discrimination should also be based on an awareness of the social (and also the economic) impact of the phenomenon – an awareness that must be relayed by NGOs (which the Member States should closely involve in their anti-discrimination policy);\n",
        "2.   Considers that it is essential to give a clear definition of positive action and to stress that positive action is not positive discrimination; notes that concrete examples of positive action might include, for example: overhauling recruitment policies and practices to identify and remove those that lead to discrimination; taking steps to bring opportunities to the attention of disadvantaged groups; setting targets to improve the representation of disadvantaged groups within the workforce; or providing assistance to help disadvantaged groups to participate in society as a whole;\n",
        "3.   Believes that the sound anti-discrimination practices introduced in the Member States, some of which are broader, stronger and more entrenched than others, should be brought together and disseminated by a process of benchmarking; believes that in this connection the network of Member State bodies responsible for combating discrimination (Equinet) could usefully be strengthened and that all the Member States should be encouraged to become involved in it; believes that the task of gathering and disseminating information and of providing coordination and impetus could eventually be entrusted to the Agency for Fundamental Rights;\n",
        "4.   Welcomes the Commission initiative to launch a European Year of Equal Opportunities in 2007 and hopes that this will help to raise awareness of the various forms of discrimination and of multiple discrimination and enable the means of redress to become better known; would nevertheless hope that preparations for such initiatives will in future begin at an earlier stage; reiterates its position that the Commission and Member States must ensure that all forms of discrimination are addressed and dealt with equally and reminds the Commission of its promise and commitment to monitor this matter closely and to report to Parliament; continues to regret the fact that inadequate funds were allocated to the Year in view of the importance of the fight against discrimination; since one of the aims of intercultural dialogue is to combat discrimination, calls for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) to continue the measures initiated in connection with 2007;\n",
        "5.   Calls on the Commission to promote education that fosters peace and non-violence and intercultural dialogue pedagogy;\n",
        "6.   Deplores the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not yet been made legally binding, and requests that this situation be remedied; is insistent that when the Commission performs the stringent, systematic checks which it has undertaken to carry out in order to ensure that its legislative and regulatory acts are compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it should make a particular effort to detect any form of discrimination (either direct or in particular indirect) which various categories of individual could suffer as a result of such acts; considers that the Commission should carry out a discrimination impact assessment on every legislative proposal to ensure policy consistency across the Commission DGs; thinks that the Agency for Fundamental Rights should be closely involved in the impact studies carried out in this connection;\n",
        "7.   Considers – as does the Commission – that if blatant inequalities of an ‘endemic’, ‘structural or even ‘cultural’ nature are to be remedied and a seriously compromised balance is thus to be restored, it may be necessary in certain cases for a temporary exception to be made to the concept of equality based on the individual in favour of group-based ‘distributive justice’ through the adoption of ‘positive’ measures;\n",
        "8.   Points out that the concepts of  ‘positive action’, ‘affirmative equality’ and ‘distributive justice’ reflect one and the same reality, the basis of which is an acknowledgement of the fact that in certain cases, effective action to combat discrimination requires active intervention by the authorities for the purpose of restoring a seriously compromised balance; stresses that intervention of this kind must not be regarded as a form of discrimination (not even as a  ‘positive’ form) and that the concept of positive action cannot be reduced to the idea of a quota; points out that such actions may in practice take the most varied forms, such as a guarantee of recruitment interviews, priority access to certain types of training leading to jobs in which certain categories of people are under-represented, priority notification of job vacancies to certain communities and the taking into account of work experience rather than qualifications alone;\n",
        "9.   Points out that the principle of equal treatment does not prevent a Member State from retaining or adopting specific measures intended to prevent or to compensate for the disadvantages linked to one of the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the EC Treaty, and insists that such measures should be extended to all sectors in which serious inequalities are found, whether in education, health care, housing, access to goods and services or any other area;\n",
        "10. Is aware that the fact that certain groups are very poorly represented in certain categories of job may have the perverse effect of discouraging those groups from endeavouring to acquire the knowledge which they need in order to gain access to the jobs concerned, which leads to a vicious circle; strongly recommends, therefore, that the high level working group on ethnic minorities in the labour market, which is due to report at the end of 2006, pay close attention to this issue and that conditions be created which will enable all categories of individual to gain access to all types and levels of education and training, at all ages, starting from childhood, if necessary through the adoption of positive measures designed to enable disadvantaged groups to follow courses of study at school or university or to undertake training courses which would not otherwise be accessible to them;\n",
        "11. Stresses the fact that migrants of Roma origin and non-citizens must be granted equality in terms of social and political rights and calls upon the Member States and the applicant countries to draw up a strategy designed to increase the involvement of Roma and non‑citizens in elections (as both voters and candidates) at all levels;\n",
        "12. Calls on those Member States which do not already have such bodies to set up a specialised administrative body to combat discrimination at national level; stresses that such bodies should be independent and should receive the necessary resources to enable them to help victims of discrimination to make use of legal remedies; considers that they should also have powers to investigate the cases referred to them;\n",
        "13. Considers that far from constituting an obstacle to the collection of data relating in particular to ethnic origin and to religion, Directive 95/46/EC provides necessary and desirable protection against any abuse of sensitive data collected for statistical purposes;\n",
        "14. Considers that, notwithstanding cultural, historical or constitutional considerations, data collection on the situation of minorities and disadvantaged groups is critical and that policy and legislation to combat discrimination must be based on accurate data;\n",
        "15. Considers that the Article 29 group set up pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC could usefully issue an opinion designed to clarify the provisions of the Directive which may hinder the collection of statistics relating to certain categories of individual and thus to ensure that those provisions are interpreted uniformly throughout the Member States;\n",
        "16. Draws attention to the fact that once personal data have been rendered anonymous for statistical purposes, the information contained in the statistics is no longer to be regarded as personal data; points out that there are also reliable techniques which enable anonymity to be observed and are traditionally used in the social sciences and which should enable statistics based on criteria deemed sensitive to be established;\n",
        "17. Notes with satisfaction that the Commission intends to create (in cooperation with the Member States’ authorities and other parties involved) statistics tools designed to assess the impact of discrimination; awaits with interest the publication of the data-collection handbook which is scheduled for 2006;\n",
        "18. Points out that the concept of indirect discrimination is intrinsically linked to quantitative criteria and that it is therefore counter-productive to prevent statistics relating to certain characteristics from being gathered under the cover of legislation on the protection of personal data, since in the absence of such data the existence of indirect discrimination becomes impossible to prove;\n",
        "19. Considers that if effective action is to be taken against all forms of indirect discrimination and if the Community directives on discrimination under which those forms are specifically prohibited are to be correctly transposed, it is essential that authorisation be granted for the supply of proof based on statistics;\n",
        "20. Calls upon the Member States to develop their statistics tools with a view to ensuring that data relating to employment, housing, education and income are available for each of the categories of individual which are likely to suffer discrimination based on one of the criteria listed in Article 13 of the EC Treaty;\n",
        "21. Draws attention to the fact that if an individual is to benefit from preferential treatment by virtue of his membership of a protected group, it must be possible for him to be identified as such, which means that sensitive data relating to him must be available; points out that such data must be processed in accordance with – in particular – the legislation relating to the protection of personal data and with Article 3(1) of the Framework Convention on the protection of national minorities;\n",
        "22. Greatly regrets the fact that, notwithstanding repeated requests by the European Parliament, the Commission is not planning at this stage to draw up comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination; recalls that better legislation does not only mean eliminating unnecessary legislation, but also developing legislation in response to strong political signals from the European Parliament; insists that a new legislative tool incorporating all the grounds for discrimination set out in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and having the same scope as Directive 2000/43/EC be submitted before mid-2007;\n",
        "23. Calls upon the Member States to take due account in their legislative practice of the various grounds for discrimination set out in Article 21 of the Charter with a view to bestowing a credibility upon that Charter which has hitherto been weakened by the fact that the Charter is not legally binding;\n",
        "24. Encourages Member States to undertake obligations without any reservations or restrictive declarations under human rights treaties in the field of non-discrimination and protection of persons belonging to minorities and other vulnerable groups, as well as honour such obligations in a good faith;\n",
        "25. Considers that traditional national minorities urgently need a framework policy standard for their effective participation in decision-making processes concerning their identity, and need to be protected by various forms of self-government or autonomy to overcome the double standards established by the Copenhagen criteria on the one hand and the lack of any rules in the Member States on the other;\n",
        "26. Calls upon the Commission to fulfil actively its obligations as guardian of the Treaties and to undertake urgent action against Member States that have failed to transpose EC law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty, such as the Race (2000/43/EC) and Employment (2000/78/EC) Directives; recalls that the Court of Justice has already found against some Member States for failing to implement the anti-discrimination directives, and urges them to take action to fulfil their duties; considers that the new Member States which have not transposed the anti-discrimination directives must be subject to infringement proceedings for violating EC law in the same way as the old Member States; requests the Commission to examine as a matter of urgency the quality and content of the laws implementing the anti-discrimination directives, including on the basis of the reports prepared by the network of independent experts on anti-discrimination, and to bring, as a matter of urgency, an action before the Court of Justice against those Member States that have not correctly transposed them;\n",
        "27. Calls upon the Commission to ensure that when anti-discrimination law is next recast, it pays particular attention to the problems of multiple discrimination and those of segregation (which constitutes a form of discrimination) and reviews the concept of indirect discrimination by explicitly authorising proof based on statistics relating to discrimination;\n",
        "28. Urges that the new EU Fundamental Rights Agency, which is due to be operational in 2007, be closely involved in the new framework for anti-discrimination and that it provide EU policy makers with timely, sound, reliable, comprehensive and relevant information from which further policy and legislation can be developed; considers that, in light of the concerns about its role and function, it is essential for the Agency to feed into and play an integral role in supporting EU anti-discrimination policy;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Council to adopt the Commission’s proposal for a Council Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia, which sets out to establish a framework for punishing racist and xenophobic violence as a criminal offence, as this Decision would contribute to the enhancement of necessary data collection on racist violence and crime across the EU;\n",
        "30. Urges the Commission to bring forward proposals to prohibit the discrimination that same-sex couples - either married or in a registered partnership - suffer in their daily lives, notably when they exercise the right to free movement enshrined in EU law; requests that the principle of mutual recognition be applied also in this field; o o        o\n",
        "31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
