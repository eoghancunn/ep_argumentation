    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Emphasises that freedom to provide services is one of the cornerstones of the European project; considers however, this should be balanced, on the one hand, against fundamental rights and the social objectives set out in the Treaties and on the other hand, against the right of the public and social partners to ensure non-discrimination, equal treatment, and the improvement of living and working conditions; recalls that collective bargaining and collective action are fundamental rights that are recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and that equal treatment is a fundamental principle of the European Union;\n",
        "2.  Is of the opinion that any EU citizen should have the right to work anywhere in the European Union and thus should have  a right to equal treatment; therefore regrets that this right is not applied uniformly across the EU; is of the view that transitional arrangements remaining in place should be subject to rigorous review by the Commission, to assess whether they are truly necessary to prevent distortions in national labour markets and, that where that is not found to be the case, they should be removed as quickly as possible;\n",
        "3.  Emphasises that freedom to provide services does not contradict and is not superior to the fundamental right of social partners  to promote social dialogue and to take industrial action, especially, since this is a constitutional right in several Member States; stresses that the intention of the Monti clause was to protect fundamental constitutional rights in the context of  the single market; recalls at the same time that free movement of workers is one of the four freedoms of the internal market;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the Lisbon treaty and the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is to be made legally binding; notes that this would include the right of trade unions to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels and, in the case of conflicts of interest, to take collective action (such as strike action) to defend their interests;\n",
        "5.  Emphasises that freedom to provide services is not superior to the fundamental rights contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in particular the right of trade unions to take industrial action, in particular since this is a constitutional right in several Member States; emphasises therefore that the ECJ rulings in Rüffert, Laval and Viking demonstrate that it is necessary to clarify that economic freedoms, as established in the Treaties, should be interpreted in such a way as not to infringe upon the exercise of fundamental social rights as recognised in the Member States and by Community law, including the right to negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements and to take collective action, and as not infringing upon the autonomy of social partners when exercising these fundamental rights in pursuit of social interests and the protection of workers;\n",
        "6. Stresses that the PWD allows public authorities and social partners to lay down terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers according to the different traditions in the Member States;\n",
        "7.  Stresses that recital 22 of the PWD states that the Directive is without prejudice to the law of the Member States concerning collective action to defend the interests of trades and professions which is confirmed by Article 137(5) of the EC Treaty;\n",
        "8.  Emphasises therefore the need to safeguard and to strengthen equal treatment and equal pay for equal work in the same workplace as laid down in Articles 39 and 12 of the EC Treaty; considers that in the framework of freedom to provide services or freedom of establishment, the nationality of the employer, or of employees or posted workers cannot justifyinequalities concerning working conditions, pay or the exercise of fundamental rights such as the right to strike;\n",
        "9.  Underlines the importance of preventing negative effects on labour market models that are already able to combine a high degree of flexibility in the labour market with a high level of security and, instead, of  promoting this approach further;\n",
        "10. Notes that the horizontal effect of certain provisions of the EC Treaty depends on precise conditions being fulfilled, inter alia the condition that those provisions confer rights on an individual who has an interest in compliance with the obligations concerned; expresses its concern that, in the specific circumstances of the judgements recently given by the ECJ, the horizontal effect of Article 43 of the EC Treaty was duly identified, and considers that this might result in more cases before the Court;\n",
        "11. Welcomes the fact that, according to the principles and traditions of the European Union, many Member States, in cooperation with social partners, have put in place high standards of working conditions that improve the well-being of all workers and enhance economic growth as well as competitiveness;\n",
        "12. Believes that the intention of the legislator in the PWD and Services Directive is incompatible with interpretations which may invite unfair competition between undertakings; notes that undertakings that sign and follow collective agreements could have a competitive disadvantage over undertakings that refuse to do so;\n",
        "13. Also takes the view that the freedom to provide cross border services in the internal market is further enhanced by ensuring that domestic and foreign service providers face similar economic and labour market conditions at the place of service delivery;\n",
        "14. Actively promotes competitiveness on the basis of knowledge and innovation as laid down in the Lisbon Strategy;\n",
        "15. Questions the introduction of a proportionality principle for actions against undertakings which, by relying on the right of establishment or the right to provide services across borders, deliberately undercut terms and conditions of employment; considers that there should be no question as to the use of industrial action to uphold equal treatment and to secure decent working conditions;\n",
        "16. Emphasises that the EU’s economic freedoms cannot be interpreted as granting undertakings the right to evade or circumvent national social and employment laws and practices, or to impose unfair competition on wages and working conditions; considers therefore that cross border actions of undertakings which may undercut terms and conditions of employment in the host country must be proportionate and cannot automatically be justified by the Treaty provisions on, for example, free movement of services or freedom of establishment;\n",
        "17. Emphasises that Community law has to respect the principle of non discrimination; emphasises further that the Community legislator has to ensure that no obstacles are created either to collective agreements, for example, those implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work for all workers in the workplace, regardless of their nationality or that of their employer, in the place where the service is provided, or to industrial action in support of such an agreement which is in accordance with  national laws or practice;\n",
        "18. Acknowledges that the ECJ rulings in the Laval, Rüffert and Luxembourg cases have caused some great concerns as to the way in which minimum harmonisation directives must be interpreted;\n",
        "19. Notes that the social considerations referred to in Articles 26 and 27 of Directive 2004/18 (Public Procurement Directive) enable the Member States to create fair competition conditions by laying down terms and conditions of employment which go beyond the mandatory rules for minimum protection;\n",
        "20. Is of the opinion that the limited legal basis of free movement of the PWD may lead to  the PWD being interpreted as an express invitation to unfair competition concerning wages and working conditions; therefore considers that the legal basis of the PWD could be broadened to include a reference to the free movement of workers,\n",
        "21. Emphasises that the current situation might as result lead to workers in host countries feeling pressured by low wage competition; considers therefore that consistent implementation of the PWD must be ensured in all Member States;\n",
        "22. Recalls that nine Member States have ratified the ILO Convention 94 on Labour Clauses (Public Contracts); regrets that even judicial rulings fail sufficiently to take into  consideration ILO convention 94 and is worried that the application of this Convention in the Member States concerned might be in conflict with the application of the PWD; calls on the Commission to clarify this situation as a matter of urgency and to continue to promote the ratification of this Convention in order to enhance further the development of social clauses in public procurement regulations, which itself is an aim of the Public Procurement Directive;\n",
        "23. Notes that it has not been recognized that, under the ILO conventions 87 and 98, restrictions on the right to industrial action and fundamental rights can only be justified on grounds of  health, public order and other similar factors;\n",
        "24. Calls on all Member States  properly to enforce the PWD; further emphasises that labour market legislation and rules concerning negotiations and collective agreements are the competence of Member States and social partners; points out, in this respect, that itis the task of the Member States to improve and to make full use of prevention, monitoring and enforcement measures, in conformity with the subsidiarity principle;\n",
        "25. Considers that current Community legislation has both loopholes and inconsistencies and therefore may have lent itself to interpretations of the PWD that were not the intention of the Community legislator, who was looking for a fair balance between the freedom to provide services and the protection of workers rights;  calls on the Commission to prepare the necessary legislative proposals which would assist in preventing conflicting interpretation in the future;\n",
        "26. Therefore welcomes the statement of 3 April 2008 in which the Commission commited itself not only to continue to tackle competition that is based on low social standards but also emphasised that the freedom to provide services does not contradict and is not in any way superior to the fundamental right to strike, and to join a trade union; encourages the implementation of the Council Conclusions of 9 June 2008 without delay to remedy shortcomings in the implementation, to prevent further problematic situations and abuses and to create the desired climate of mutual trust and confidence; calls on the Commission and the Members States to foster closer cooperation between the Members States, national authorities and the Commission with regard to monitoring and the  exchange of best practice; considers that this would be an effective way to combat misuse;\n",
        "27. Welcomes the Commission's indication that it is now ready to re-examine the impact of the internal market on labour rights and collective bargaining.\n",
        "28. Suggests that this re-examination should not exclude a partial review of the PWD, with specific regard to the issues of applicable working conditions, pay levels, the principle of equal treatment of workers in the context of free movement of services, respect for different labour models and the duration of posting.\n",
        "29. Believes that the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States, in ILO Conventions and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the right to negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements and the right to take industrial action should not be put at risk.\n",
        "30. Emphasises that it must be made absolutely clear that the PWD and other directives do not prohibit member states and social partners from demanding more favourable conditions, aimed at equal treatment of workers, and that there are assurances that Community  legislation can be implemented on the basis of all the existing labour market models.\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission to implement the decisions of the Council regarding the establishment of an electronic system for exchange of information as a matter of urgency as it could enable Member States to combat abuses more effectively.\n",
        "32. Asks the Member States and the Commission to adopt measures to combat abuses, in particular regarding activities of those \"letterbox-companies\" which are not engaged in any genuine and effective business in the country of establishment but which have been created, sometimes even directly by the main contractor in the host country, for the sole purpose of carrying out business in the host country, in order to circumvent the full application of host country rules and regulations in particular with regard to wages and working conditions ; calls on the Commission to lay down clear rules to combat \"letterbox companies\" in its code of conduct for undertakings under the Services Directive;\n",
        "33. Reaffirms that fundamental social rights are not subordinate to economic rights in a hierarchy of fundamental freedoms; therefore asks for a re-assertion in primary law of the balance between fundamental rights and economic freedoms in order to help avoiding a race to lower social standards;\n",
        "34. Welcomes the common position of the Council on a new Temporary Agency Directive which would provide for non-discriminatory treatment from the first day of employment unless the social partners agree otherwise;\n",
        "35. Calls on the Commission to put forward the long awaited Communication on transnational collective bargaining proposing the establishment of a legal framework for transnational collective agreements; o o        o\n",
        "36. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, and the Parliaments of the Member States.\n"
