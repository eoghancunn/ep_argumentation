{"speaker": "Olle Schmidt (ALDE). -", "english": "Olle Schmidt (ALDE). - (SV) Madam President, thank you, Mr Andersson, for an important report. Much revolves around the Laval ruling, where the Swedish trade union went too far. The report contains a lot of things that I do not like. It has a particular tone when interpreting the European Court of Justice and in several places there are indications of what Mr Andersson originally wanted, that is to tear up the Posting of Workers Directive. However, this is not stated in the revised report, as Mr Hökmark so rightly points out. Now it is a question of not excluding a partial review of the Directive, which is more in line with the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for which I was responsible.\nThe vote will hopefully also establish that the Posting of Workers Directive does not need to be torn up. Please see proposals 14 and 15 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.\nMr Andersson, it is wrong to believe that the Swedish model is best preserved by going via Brussels. It is precisely the reverse. If we go via Brussels then we may endanger the Swedish model based on responsible parties and we will get legislation and minimum wages in Sweden. This cannot reasonably be in the interests of the Swedish trade unions.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Olle Schmidt (ALDE). - (SV) Madam President, thank you, Mr Andersson, for an important report.
