{"speaker": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE). - (SV) Madam President, I would like to emphasise what is contained in the report and what is not. I would like to thank the rapporteur. He was sympathetic to the different views within the committee, and this means, Mr Špidla, that there is no requirement in report to tear up or redraft the Posting of Workers Directive. To start with, the report contained a lot of condemnation and criticism of the Court, but this has been taken out. This is what we are talking about now.\nTo emphasise this point I would like to quote in English:\nI will quote the English text of paragraph 27: ‘Welcomes the Commission’s indication that it is now ready to re-examine the impact of the internal market on labour rights and collective bargaining’; and: ‘Suggests that this re-examination should not exclude a partial review of the PWD’ – meaning ‘not exclude’.\n(SV) Madam President, this means that there is no need for an amendment. However, a review by the Commission of how this works in practice in the various Member States is welcomed. If this review gives grounds for amendments, these should not be ruled out.\nI wanted to say this because the Posting of Workers Directive plays a very important role. One million people have the opportunity to work in different countries. This is also about equal treatment, about equal rights to work in all parts of the European Union, even if someone has a collective agreement from his or her home country. This is what it is all about. As long as people comply with the rules of the Posting of Workers Directive they have the right to work anywhere in the EU. This was also the conclusion arrived at by the Court in the Laval case, for example.\nCommissioner, Madam President, the criticism levelled at the Court is no longer included in the committee’s proposal and there is no requirement to tear up the Posting of Workers Directive. It is important to remember this as we continue the debate.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE). - (SV) Madam President, I would like to emphasise what is contained in the report and what is not.
