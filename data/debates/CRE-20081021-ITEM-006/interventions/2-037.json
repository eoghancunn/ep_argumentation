The re-emerging unseemly debate has caused a great deal of harm to the entire EU. Some people are sounding the alarm bell about social dumping, an unlimited invasion by workers of new Member States. This is factually untrue. Let us be realistic. Let us not threaten voters with such talk. The twelve new Member States have almost no comparative edge. One of these advantages, relatively cheaper labour, will only last only a few years. Fortunately, salaries are rising in our countries too. I appeal to you that when you talk about equal treatment – this is another aspect of this matter –, let there be equal treatment for new and old members alike. If we limit the potential inherent in the competition within the internal market, if we restrict freedom of enterprise, this will damage the entire EU.
