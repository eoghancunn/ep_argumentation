{"speaker": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE),", "english": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . – Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Ransdorf has incorporated many of our committee’s suggestions into his report.\nIt is clear that nanosciences and nanotechnologies represent one of the fastest-growing industries of the 21st century. Nanotechnology has the potential to have an impact on a number of industries and it has a predicted market of nearly one trillion euros within a decade.\nHowever, Europe has been slow to realise this potential and thus holds a small market share in research and development and education and, as a result, industrial innovation in this field. It is imperative that the EU adopt this plan to support nanoscience development, education and vocation within the Member States. Furthermore, an emphasis on nanoscience and nanotechnology is critical to reaching the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy.\nWith regard to the report, I should like to highlight a few goals that have been incorporated and identify an important point that unfortunately has not been addressed adequately. Firstly, nanoscience and nanotechnology is permeated with ethical issues. As such, I am pleased that the report has included our committee’s suggestion to maintain high ethical principles and has welcomed public reviews on non-therapeutic human enhancement and privacy. In addition, I support the Commission’s proposal to respond to the dynamic nature needed for proper regulation in this field.\nSecondly, the proposal has a strong emphasis on patents. Reform, as well as global incorporation of the patent system for nanoscience and nanotechnology within the Member States, is crucial to Europe’s success in this field. Reform must include a decrease in cost for the patent process, as well as an increase in accessibility of patents for SMEs. Furthermore, to promote global compliance with patent recognition and protection, we should emphasise the importance of fulfilling WTO regulations, especially in China.\nHowever, protection of intellectual property rights, both internationally and within Europe, has not been developed sufficiently in the report. Member States are called upon to coordinate actions regarding IPR and act within OECD and UNESCO. This is too weak to protect IPR in this field. These organisations deal more with promoting good practices than with ensuring action. Thus, real standards could prove more effective.\nWith strong growth projected in the field of nanosciences and nanotechnology, it is important that the EU accept the Commission proposal to adopt new approaches to this industry, from education to R&D. Such actions will contribute to heightened competitiveness and development in our Member States.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . – Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Ransdorf has incorporated many of our committee’s suggestions into his report.\nIt is clear that nanosciences and nanotechnologies represent one of the fastest-growing industries of the 21st century.
