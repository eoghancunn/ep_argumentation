    "paragraphs": [
        "1.Recognises that biogas is a vital energy resource that contributes to sustainable economic, agricultural and rural development and environmental protection;\n",
        "2.Stresses the contribution that biogas can make to reducing the European Union's energy dependence;\n",
        "3.   Stresses that biogas production from manure, sludge and municipal, animal and organic wastecontributes to energy diversification and can therefore increasingly not only contribute to the security, competitiveness and sustainability of energy supply but also offer farmers new income opportunities;\n",
        "4.     Believes that the use of biogas especially for heat and power productioncould contribute significantly to the binding target of 20% renewable energy in overall European Union energy consumption by 2020;\n",
        "5.      Stresses that, in the long term, renewable energy sources such as biogas and biofuels, together with solar power and wind energy, subject to further intensified research efforts, can bring about a higherdegree of independence from fossil-fuel energy sources;\n",
        "6.   Encourages both the European Union and the Member States to exploit the huge potential in biogas by creating a favourable environment, as well as maintaining and developing support schemes to inspire investment in, and sustenance of, biogas plants;\n",
        "7.   Emphasises that biogas from manure has numerous environmental advantages, such as the reduction of methane and CO2-emissions, reduction of emissions of particulate matter and nitrous oxides, a far less obnoxious odour, hygienisation of slurry and better fertilizing capacity of the nitrogen in the treated manure, which means that less nitrogen is needed to achieve the same fertilising effect;\n",
        "8.   Stresses that producing agrofuels from waste should not become a goal in itself; reducing waste should continue to be a priority in the environmental policy of the European Union and in that of Member States;\n",
        "9.  Calls for greater use to be made of slurry as a source of biogas, since such use still has immense potential, while also encouraging the decentralisation of energy-producing biogas installations; notes that the increased use of slurry to this end can lead to a significant reduction in the release of methane in slurry storage;\n",
        "10. Stresses that animal manure, municipal sewage and agro-industrial waste can contain substances (bacteria, viruses, parasites, heavy metals, harmful organic substances) that can potentially be a threat to public health or the environment; urges the Commission to ensure that adequate precautions are taken to avoid contamination and spreading of these substances and any diseases they induce;\n",
        "11. States that the use of sludge and animal or organic waste will improve efficiency of biogas installations; states that hygienic problems in the use of animal waste can, in most cases, be comparatively easily controlled;\n",
        "12. Calls also for the products of first-stage processing, such as potato peelings or fruit flesh, to be used as biomass for biogas installations;\n",
        "13. Stresses that technical and management developments are expected in the near future which will further increase environmental and health benefits of biogas plants using manure, slurry and organic waste;\n",
        "14. Believes that, for biogas installations just as for animal holdings, sustainability and a size that is adapted to the particular region are essential if the environmental benefits are to also lead to greater acceptance of animal holdings, which encounter many problems due to an increased number of complaints from neighbours and the general public;\n",
        "15. Points out that biogas installation on the basis of manure, sludge or organic waste may lead to higher rates of leaching of ammonia, but states that this side effect can be contained relatively easily, and preventive measures ought to be incorporated into national laws concerning biogas installations as well as into aid grants for biogas installations;\n",
        "16. Urges Member States and the Commission to ensure that biogas installations do not leak methane, as that could compromise the positive effect on global warming;\n",
        "17.      Reiterates that all financial support for biogas installations ought to be based on efficiency, technical development, a positive greenhouse gas balance, the creation of added value on farm holdings andin the rural regions, and other economic and environmental advantages of installations; stresses that security of food supply to the population must not be jeopardised;\n",
        "18. Notes with deep concern the increasing competition in many Member States between energy use and use in the food chain of certain agricultural products like maize; underlines the fact that such competition has led to a considerable increase in feedingstuff prices;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Member States and the Commission, when putting forward future proposals on regulation of the biogas sector, to examine not only the environmental aspects but also the impact on high-quality, sustainable food production;\n",
        "20. Emphasises that biogas production based on animal manure, sludge and animal and organic waste should be prioritised as the sustainability and environmental benefits of these methods are unequivocal;\n",
        "21.Notes that the optimal size of a biogas plant depends on various circumstances determining the economics of scale, that should be thoroughly studied; considers that, in addition to an economic assessment and the greenhouse gas balance, it is above all necessary to assess the impact of the size of the plant on the surrounding landscape with regard to expansion of monoculture in respect of certain crops;\n",
        "22.      Stresses that it would be best for biogas plant operators to combine and use all available organic matter both from an environmental and economic aspect;\n",
        "23. Considers that, whilst the young and innovative biogas sector needs start-up support, such support schemes should only last until the sector has become commercially viable; calls, therefore, for a uniform support instrument to be tested in the EU, along the lines of the German Renewable Energy Act;\n",
        "24. States that funding for solely plant-based biogas installations needs to be continued under careful monitoring and re-focusing on the most advanced and efficient plants or systems to ensure Europe's economic and technical advantage in the field and to explore options for the future;\n",
        "25. Asks the Commission to report on how criteria on economic and environmental efficiency and sustainability can be introduced for energy crops, which would lead to this relatively new technique becoming more environmentally friendly, and which would ensure that the concerns relating to food production and supply are properly addressed,\n",
        "26. Calls for greater effort to be put into researching and promoting new technologies for biogas, particularly into the exploitation of biomass (second-generation biogas) as a biofuel and improving the profitability of biogas plants,that offer the greatest environmental benefits, since it is only by means of innovative technology, such as gas recovery techniques, that the effectiveness of biogas installations can be significantly increased;\n",
        "27. Stresses, in this context, the importance of green gene technology and calls on the Member States and the Commission to put more effort into researching the latest seed and plant protection technologies, to ensure that biogas production does not compete with high-quality food production and to enable the proportion of biomass per area unit to be significantly increased;\n",
        "28. Reminds Member States and the Commission that further advancement of biogas is not possible without additional funding; recalls that funding needs to be provided for research and development, for the promotion of results from specific projects, for installations and for the increased support of 'green electricity' and 'green gas';\n",
        "29. Recalls that those Member States that are providing extra incentives to 'green energy' by means of adequate price subsidies or through other measures are also the most successful in promoting biogas;\n",
        "30. Considers that 'green gas' production should be subsidised in the same way as 'green electricity';\n",
        "31. Demands that the Commission and Member States ensure that funds from European and national programmes go to the most efficient and sustainable installations, especially to installations that  produce electricity and heat or to the installation of facilities and grids for upgrading and feeding biogas into the natural gas network;\n",
        "32.      Stresses in this regard that the supply of electricity, heat and natural gas to networks must be non-discriminatory, and calls for biogas to be treated in the same way as natural gas to enable it to achieve its full potential once it has been introduced into the natural gas network;\n",
        "33. Believes that simplification of the procedures for trade in CO2  can significantly contribute to the economic viability and sustainability of biogas plants;\n",
        "34. Stresses that biogas installations may assist farmers who do not yet have enough storage capacity for manure to solve this problem in an economically viable manner;\n",
        "35. Asks the Commission and the Member States to ensure, that the setting up of biogas plants as well as the authorisation of the use of use of organic waste and sludge is not impeded by unnecessarily lengthy bureaucratic procedures and regulations;\n",
        "36. Draws attention to the major differences in terms of length and content that exist between national approval procedures for biogas installations, and calls on the Member States to prevent national requirements in the area of regional planning and the granting of licences and approvals from forming an unnecessary hindrance;\n",
        "37. Calls for a simplified planning permission procedure to be introduced for the construction of biogas installations;\n",
        "38. Calls on the Commission to establish a common positive list of products which are allowed for use in biogas installations, so as to ensure a level playing field between farmers in different Member States;\n",
        "39.      Encourages farmers to co-operate in setting up and operating biogas plants;\n",
        "40.  Demands that the Commission and Member States develop a coherent biogas-policy;  asks the Commission to present a specific report on biogas and its promotion in Europe outlining the necessary changes in Community and national law to facilitate further expansion of the biogas sector, pointing out the most efficient ways of using European funds and programmes as well as giving best practice examples; asks also, in this regard, for an assessment to be given of the impact of the various forms of biogas production on climate, the ecology of the landscape, rural incomes and worldwide food security;\n",
        "41.      Promotes the adoption of an EU-directive on biogas production that should include the following elements: a)Specific targets for the priority use of manure, for instance in the form of the share of the livestock manure that is digested, and taking into account the agricultural conditions and the situation in the Member States, b)Annual statistics and reports on agricultural biogas production in order to be able to follow up on the targets, c)Measures for the construction and promotion of biogas-installations based on a national or regional impact assessment, promoting those installations that, nationally and/or regionally, are most beneficial to the environment and which are economically sustainable; measures for the dissemination and promotion of results gained from prior experiences or demonstration projects need to be included in all plans; if regional and rural development regulations do not allow funding of such measures, they must be amended, d)EU Member States should engage in national and regional planning in order to limit legal and administrative impediments, for instance natural gas or other fossil fuels should not be preferred in areas in which it is feasible to sell heat from biogas to local heating providers,\n",
        "42. Urges the Commission to present as soon as possible a proposal for a biowaste directive, which shall include quality standards; invites the Commission to explore the possibility for a joint biogas and biowaste directive;\n",
        "43. Asks the Commission to present proposals for legislation on the use of residues from biogas installations; asks the Commission to ensure that onlyorganic material that allows residues to be used without endangering the environment may beused in biogas installations; asks the Commission to consider banning growth enhancers in animal feed containing heavy metals if this should prove to be a Europe-wide problem for subsequent use of biogas residues in fields;\n",
        "44. Asks the Commission to ensure that the IPPC Directive, Nitrates Directives, Sewage Sludge Directive, Water Framework Directive, Birds Directive, Habitats Directive and the Heavy Metals legislation are enforced effectively in all Member States and regions, thereby making biogas installation based on manure and sludge more attractive;\n",
        "45. Demands that the Commission present as soon as possible a strategy to include biogas installations in the Kyoto-mechanism, for example through 'green certificates', special premiums or tax-credits for electricity and heat from biogas-installations or other measures; points out that this would increase the cost-efficiency of biogas installations and at the same time make efforts in the area of agriculture to combat climate change more transparent;\n",
        "46. Calls for an assessment of the superfluity of the Nitrates Directive once the Groundwater Directive is fully implemented;\n",
        "47. Asks the Commission to foster the feeding of biogas into natural gas networks by way of recommendations or a directive;\n",
        "48. Asks the Commission to present as soon as possible its proposals for further enhancing the use of animal and agricultural crop by-products for biogas as announced in the 'Biomass action plan';\n",
        "49.  Demands that Member States that have not incorporated any measures or have not incorporated sufficient measures in existing national development programmes ought to include biogas in their mid-term evaluation of existing rural and regional development programmes, and propose actions for the future;\n",
        "50. Calls on the Commission to ensure cooperation and coordination between the Member States, including those who currently have no biogas plants, or just a small number thereof, so they may learn about each other's best practices with biogas plants through knowledge and technology transfer;\n",
        "51. Asks the Commission to present a coherent report on European biogas production and future prospects in this area, including an impact assessment,to the European Parliament by 15 December 2008 at the latest, taking into account the above-mentioned proposals and the progress made;\n",
        "52. Invites the current and upcoming Presidencies to advance further discussions on how to promote sustainable biogas production;in this regard the sustainable promotion of biogas facilities should also include combined heat and power production;\n",
        "53. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, and to the national parliaments and governments of the Member States.\n"
