{"speaker": "Mariann Fischer Boel,", "english": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, my thanks to all those who have contributed to this discussion. As always happens, it is very difficult to concentrate only on biogas – we then start a discussion on all renewable energies.\nThis whole discussion is based on the energy report published by the Commission last January, because we could suddenly see that we were depending heavily on imports of energy, especially from our eastern neighbours, and secondly: how could we contribute to the reduction of CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions? Suddenly all the different ideas were put on the table.\nWhen we talk about the transport sector, 10% needs to come from renewable energies by 2020, and here the agricultural sector was the first supplier – and is at this stage the only supplier. We all know – and we have heard it today as well – about the competition between food, feed and fuel. This will be a discussion as long as we are in the first generation of those different biofuels. I therefore completely agree with those who have underlined the necessity of investing heavily in research and development so that we can pass through the first generation and enter into the second generation.\nIt is crucial for it to be economically viable in the future, which it is not today with the different types of renewable energies. We need to be able to find the ‘golden solution’, so that it becomes economically sustainable.\nAnother issue is sustainability – environmental sustainability. Here we have a very clear approach. We will not accept renewable energies that are not produced in a sustainable way, and this is related both to production within the European Union and to renewable energies that will be imported from overseas. We will need imports. Do not try to convince anyone that we can rely exclusively on European production. That is simply not possible; we will need imports.\nI think it is a splendid idea to continue working hard on biogas. Here we use waste – slurry – and all the residue from slaughterhouses, which is a very good component in this production process. From an agricultural-environmental point of view this can solve some of the problems that some Member States, some regions, are facing with the Nitrates Directive, as mentioned here tonight. It can help solve these problems as well.\nI think there are lots of possibilities in the renewable energy sector, but we need to push for further investments to be able to make it a viable solution for the future. Once again my thanks to the rapporteur. It has been a very good report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, my thanks to all those who have contributed to this discussion.
