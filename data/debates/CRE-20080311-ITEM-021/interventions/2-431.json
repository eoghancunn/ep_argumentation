{"speaker": "Jim Allister,", "english": "Jim Allister, on behalf of the NI Group . – Madam President, I welcome the recognition of the potential for a considerable increase in biogas production. It ticks the boxes of helping livestock farmers tap into an alternative income stream and, at the same time, makes a worthwhile contribution to the environment by solving problems allied to the disposal of agricultural waste.\nA third distinct advantage for biogas is that, unlike biofuels, it need not hinder food security but, rather, help it. Therein is a key advantage for biogas: using waste rather than crops, it does not discourage essential feedstuff production or food production itself.\nThe fledgling biogas sector needs meaningful start-up support with a uniform support instrument across the EU rather than the sporadic patchwork of support which we have at the moment. Extra research support to exploit second-generation biogas as a biofuel is a forward-looking necessity. So there is much that can and should be done to promote biogas and, at the same time, make agriculture more sustainable.\nI believe in the EU we grossly miscalculated in over-indulging biofuels. Let us not compound that error by undervaluing biogas.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jim Allister, on behalf of the NI Group . – Madam President, I welcome the recognition of the potential for a considerable increase in biogas production.
