And, as we have all experienced in the last two years, this is also a vitally important issue when it comes to energy and foreign relations.\nWe already have problems in Europe when it comes to security of supply, consumer rights and environmental concerns, and we have to do something about the greenhouse effect.\nWe also have a disturbance on the market that is severe, which Neelie Kroes’s report showed us very clearly and which puts on the table the need to unbundle, which is also a foreign relations concern. This is a very important aspect of this issue. So we have to rebuild our energy system in Europe with regard to production, distribution and consumption.\nI would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Saryusz-Wolski for very good cooperation. He has taken account of all the texts from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. What I am not so happy about is what he added with regard to the new Solana-like function, to be able to talk with one voice for the European Union. This new institution would, as I see it, cause uncertainty of roles, a divide-and-conquer situation, and it takes completely the opposite approach to our cornerstones in our energy policy. We cannot check on reciprocity with an institution like this, transparency is ruled out and the powers of Parliament are diminished, which is also completely the opposite of what we want in all other areas. We have therefore asked for a split vote on this topic tomorrow.\nFinally, I want to agree with the Commissioner that it is vitally important that we add the energy issue to the new Treaty.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Lena Ek (ALDE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . – Madam President, the cornerstones of the energy policy for the European Union are transparency, reciprocity and the rule of law.
