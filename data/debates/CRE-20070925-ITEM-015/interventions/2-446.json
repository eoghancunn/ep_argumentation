Access to energy is an essential enabling factor for economic growth and for the provision of basic living conditions for all human beings.\nEU Member States and European energy companies cooperate extensively with developing countries in the field of energy, yet it is not always clear how much the citizens of these resources actually benefit. For this reason, I support all steps aimed at promoting transparency, the rule of law and improved governance in the energy sector.\nEconomic development does not have to mean repeating the polluting practices of the industrialised countries. Many developing countries are heavily dependent on high carbon-emitting sources of energy. They need assistance to be able to diversify their sources of energy to achieve a more sustainable mix.

We should take all reasonable steps to encourage their transition to clean technologies through building sustainable energy capacity and facilitating the transfer of clean technologies.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE), in writing . – It is vital we ensure that the principles and goals of the EU’s development policy are respected and promoted through the measures foreseen in the field of energy and foreign policy.
