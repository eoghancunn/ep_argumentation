{"speaker": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE),", "english": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE), in writing . – In our efforts to tackle climate change we should not jeopardise efforts to protect biodiversity, ecosystems and Europe’s food security. The 8/9 March Council conclusions specify that the 10% target for biofuels is an appropriate target only if it is subject to sustainable production. The impacts of first-generation biofuels maybe greater than originally thought, for instance the USA’s desire to use bioethanol has led to a massive increase in the use of grain for biofuels production. This demand is having a negative effect on European grain supplies with predictions that it will get much worse as the US surplus of grain diminishes. The OECD-FAO foresees a significant impact of biofuels production on agriculture commodity prices with possible knock on effects on food importing countries. A comprehensive international certification scheme for biofuels is therefore needed – as referred both in the Saryusz-Wolski and Thomsen reports – where both exports and imports to the EU are certified. The certification criteria should be designed to ensure that biofuels provide significant greenhouse gas savings over the whole life cycle and that their production does not cause a loss in biodiversity or major socioeconomic problems such as serious food price inflation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE), in writing . – In our efforts to tackle climate change we should not jeopardise efforts to protect biodiversity, ecosystems and Europe’s food security.
