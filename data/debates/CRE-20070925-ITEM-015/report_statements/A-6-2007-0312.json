        "1.  Calls for the development of a common European foreign policy on energy which would significantly contribute to guaranteeing energy security for the whole of the EU, while at the same time pursuing the objective of sustainability at the international level,thus providing EU citizens with substantial added value to efforts made at national level;\n",
        "2.  Considers that energy policy must be an integrated and prominent part of the common foreign policy, and that energy policy should be taken into account in all foreign policy contexts;\n",
        "3.  Stresses that, whilst the Member States should retain their sovereign right to make strategic choices concerning the energy mix, to exploit their energy resources and to decide on the supply structures, there is a need to elaborate concrete provisions, to be included in the Treaties, leading to the creation of a common European foreign policy on energy, covering security of supply, transit and investmentrelated to energy security, and the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings as well as clean and renewable energy sources, particularly in relations with countries whose energy consumption is growing rapidly;\n",
        "4.  Calls for a suitable Treaty basis for energy and energy security;\n",
        "5.  Stresses that a comprehensive European foreign policy on energy must contribute to the promotion and implementation of the values and interests of the European Union and the main aims of its foreign policy, namely the safeguarding of peace and the primacy of human rights, democracy and the rule of law; recognises that the EU's dependency on imported energy may have significant effects on the independence of its decision-making in other policy areas;\n",
        "6.  Regards it as vital for the EU to continue to lead the global fight against climate change, which among other risks may lead to substantial migratory movements and security threats, and to fulfil the Kyoto Protocol targets; in this context, fully supports the ongoing efforts to forge a multilateral post-2012 framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; considers it necessary to integrate the EU's endeavours in the development of renewable and clean energy sources and technologies for energy saving into all external relations;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the creation of NESCO; calls on the Member States and the Commission to consolidate its activity with a view to fully developing its operational capabilities and using it as an effective early warning system in case of energy security threats, as well as a system of information exchange in the field of energy;\n",

        "9.  Calls on the Council and the Commission to set up, by the end of 2007, a precise road map leading to the formation of such policy, indicating short, medium and long-term objectives, targets and steps, with specific time-frame for implementing them;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to submit an annual progress report concerning the implementation of the above-mentioned objectives, in order to allow the European Parliament to be closely involved in the monitoring of the commonEuropean foreign policy on energy;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission to prepare annual reports concerning observance of the rules governing the internal market in the energy sector, notably as regards transparency and compliance with EU competition law, by third-country companies, especially main suppliers, together with all of their subsidiaries; welcomes the invitation extended by the European Summit of 8-9 March 2007 to the Commission to assess the impact of vertically integrated energy companies from third countries on the internal market and how to implement the principle of reciprocity;\n",
        "12. Supports the Commission's intention to take appropriate measures to prevent uncontrolled investment by state-owned foreign companies in the EU's energy sector, in particular the gas and electricity transmission networks;\n",
        "13. Calls for closer coordination between the Presidency, the Commission and the High Representative so that they may speak and act jointly with one voice on issues concerning a common foreign policy on energy; considers it necessary to strengthen the role of the Commission and the European Parliament in defining the common foreign policy on energy in the forthcoming revision of the Treaties; proposes, after the new Reform Treaty enters into force, to appoint, with the approval of the Council and the Commission, a High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, who, wearing a “double hat”, would act under the authority of the newly created strengthened High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, a Vice-President of the Commission, thus being anchored both in the Council and in the Commission, and who should be responsible for coordinating all policies under the scope of the common European foreign policy on energy, thereby contributing to the EU's ability to protect its energy security interests in negotiating with the EU's external partners;\n",
        "14. Is convinced that the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) should be the cornerstone of the common European foreign policy on energy as it is the international community's most significant instrument for the promotion of cooperation in the energy sector, provides a basis for fair and equitable treatment, ensures security of investments and guarantees a right to compensation in the event of expropriation and/or nationalisation; calls on the Commission and the Council to strongly demand the application of the ECT, and to include the substance of the Transit Protocol in all treaties and agreements with its energy partners;\n",
        "15. Encourages the Member States and the Commission to pursue efforts to promote within the EU neighbourhood, in cooperation with third countries, the extension of the principles and norms of the internal market; urges the Commission, therefore, to consider extending the European Energy Community comprising the EU and South Eastern Europe, to other third countries, as appropriate, and creating new regional energy markets modelled thereon, such as a Euro-Mediterranean energy community, to ensure security of supply;\n",
        "16. Is of the opinion that, taking into consideration the increasing dependence of the EU on a limited number of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes, it is essential to support the priority initiatives aimed at their diversification, both geographically and by developing sustainable alternatives;believes that special priority should be given to environmentally safe and renewable energy sources; considers that security of supply at affordable and predictable prices must be a major goal for the EU;\n",
        "17. Supports the prioritisation of all the energy diversification projects realised within the neighbourhood – especially those aimed at creating new transport corridors which diversify both suppliers and routes, such as the Caspian Sea-Black Sea - EU Energy corridor – in particular the construction of the Nabucco pipeline, liquefied natural gas infrastructure (LNG), the interconnection of electricity grids and the completion of the Euro-Mediterranean electricity and gas infrastructure rings as well as the realisation of new oil infrastructure projects of European interest such as the Odessa-Gdańsk and Constanta-Trieste projects which should be included in the list of high-priority projects of European interest;\n",
        "18. Welcomes the nomination of EU coordinators for priority projects of European interest, as defined by the European Council in its conclusions of March 2007, in particular for the Nabucco project and the Power-Link between Germany, Poland and Lithuania;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pursue active policies at the highest political level so as to enable the Community to diversify its natural gas sources; expects that any cooperation between gas exporting countries would respect an open,transparent and competitive market; considers that an initiative to create a gas version of OPEC would be contrary to that aim;\n",
        "20. Notes that it is essential to move beyond declarations and open bids for concrete priority projects, and calls for the High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, upon being appointed, to be also responsible for coordinating the engagement in developing external energy infrastructure, such as the Nabucco and Odessa-Gdańsk projects; meanwhile, calls on the Commission, the Presidency and the High Representative to strengthen the commitment to developing external energy infrastructures, together with the European coordinators;\n",
        "21. Considers that the realisation of the energy diversification projects should be one of the priorities of the strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy, and calls for enhanced support for improvement of the investment climate and the regulatory framework, based on the principles of the ECT, in the energy sectors of the producer and transit countries;\n",
        "22. Calls for recognition of the diversity of situations in which various Member States find themselves when it comes to energy mix, import dependency and infrastructure, and supports all efforts aimed at overcoming the existing dependencies of Member States on dominant suppliers, on infrastructure limitations, on carbon-intensive sources of energy and on energy imports from countries that systematically violate the letter and spirit of the UN Charter;\n",
        "23. Supports all efforts aimed at establishing new sources for financing allimportantundertakings, including special loans from the EIB, as well as earmarking for that very purpose special budgetary lines within the EU budget, provided that they do not undermine the security of any Member State;\n",
        "24. Calls for the improvement of cooperation with the EIB and the EBRD, with a view to using financial instruments to back up priority projects;\n",
        "25. Considers potential import dependency on biofuels to be as worrying as dependence on external supplies of oil or gas; calls on the Commission to develop, together with the EU’s partners, a global certification scheme which can ensure the sustainability of the production and use of biofuels that do not pose a threat to biodiversity, together with standards for the cultivation and processing phases as well as for the overall life-cycle balance of greenhouse gases;\n",
        "26. Considers it inevitable for the Union to develop a long-term strategy and framework leading to the creation of a common foreign policy on energy, in order to adopt a strong position in dialogue with main supplier countries and to enhance the ability to speak with one voice in the discussions held at the EU, Member State and industry levels, which will provide a platform for solidarity in other policy areas and for strengthening the external role of the Union;\n",
        "27. In the short term, calls on the Member States to keep each other and the Commission informed of, and moreover to consult each other and the Commission on, strategic decisions concerning major bilateral agreements with third countries on energy projects which could affect the interests of other Member States and the EU as a whole, as should be done in respect of all foreign policy questions of common interest; and, where bilateral agreements have been reached that run contrary to the interests of other Member States and the EU as a whole, calls on the Member States and, where appropriate, the Commission to work together to reach agreement ensuring the neutralisation of any negative effects,in particular as regards environmental impact,in accordance with the principle of solidarity;\n",
        "28. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to ensure that a full environmental impact assessment is carried out before deciding on major infrastructure investments; in particular, urges them to consider the threat to ecosystems and human life represented by the planned North European Pipe Line/Nord Stream due to the existence of ammunition and weapons dumps on the seabed along the path of the planned pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea; points out that, should a major ecological disaster occur, the financial responsibility should lie with the parties involved;\n",
        "29. In the medium term, calls for the Commission to be vested with institutional competence to negotiate EU framework agreements with third countries concerning energy supply;\n",
        "30. Considering that solidarity and energy security are necessary for the smooth functioning of the internal market, including equal access to energy for all economic operators, calls on the Council and the Member States to create a solidarity mechanism, (in accordance with the spirit of solidarity between Members States referred to in the new Reform Treaty agreed upon by the European Council in June 2007, which would allow the EU to act efficiently, swiftly and coherently in crisis situations caused by disruption of supply, damage to critical infrastructure or any other event;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission to support the so-called “energy security clause” to be included in trade, association, and partnership and cooperation agreements with producer and transit countries, which would lay down a code of conduct and explicitly outline measures to be taken in the event of disruption, or any unilateral change in the terms, of supply by one of the partners;\n",
        "32. Supports the creation of an efficient mechanism, to include NESCO, with which to react in the event of supply disruptions, including measures to make effective use of warning systems and build up an interconnecting EU energy crisis infrastructure, especially for gas and electricity, which could be used to assist Member States in need, taking into account the geological and geographic features of those Member States, particularly as regards storage capacities and their proximity to sources of energy supply;\n",
        "33. Calls on the EU and the Member States to further engage actively in a close dialogue between the EU and all major producer, transit and consumer countries and, in particular, to step up relations in the energy sector with Algeria, Egypt and the other producer countries in the Mashreq/Maghreb region;\n",
        "34. Supports all steps aimed at promoting transparency, the rule of law and improved governance in the energy sector through energy partnerships with third countries, with the objective of creating mutually beneficial, open, transparent, non-discriminatory, stable legal conditions for access to upstream assets and for energy investment and trade, to be based on the principle of reciprocity and fair and transparent competition, ensuring that the income from energy trading will not be misused and diverted to finance terrorism;\n",
        "35. Stresses the need to pursue research and development partnerships with major consumer and transitcountries outside the EU, in order to tackle the challenge of global warming and develop alternative and renewable energy sources; underlines that enhanced energy cooperation with such third countries, including the US, should be carried out with particular regard to the development of energy-efficient technologies and the promotion of combined heat and power from renewable and sustainable biomass production and use;\n",
