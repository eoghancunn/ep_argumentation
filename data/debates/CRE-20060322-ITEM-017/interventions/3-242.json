They play an important and crucial role in promoting democratic values such as freedom, tolerance, solidarity and gender equality. In parallel with this, we require a dialogue with citizens on the future of Europe and, in this context, political parties must play a key role.\nMr Leinen’s report is commendable in its support of European political parties and its recommendation to improve the current situation. However, Mr Leinen and our political family have been stopped by the PPE-DE Group from mentioning the vital role of European political parties in furthering the priority of gender equality. I should like to ask my colleagues to reconsider this, especially those in the PPE-DE Group, who voted against an amendment in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. That amendment stated that European political parties should take into account the principle of equal opportunities when filling posts in party offices and on party lists for election. We should not forget that women form the majority of our population.\nAs President of the PSE’s women’s group, I am aware of the tremendous work that our political family does in this field throughout the European Parliament. Other political parties should be doing the same. I urge my colleagues from the PPE-DE Group to rethink their position and to uphold the values of the EU.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Zita Gurmai (PSE). – Mr President, political parties are a vital element in building and reinforcing a European political sphere.
