        "1. Notes that there is gulf between many members of the public and the European institutions, and one of the reasons for this is that to date there has been inadequate political communication or information about European policy;\n",
        "2. Is convinced that political parties at European level must take on a further role than that of umbrella organisations and become active proponents of European policy options, firmly rooted in all levels of society and working for genuine citizen involvement not only through European elections, but also in all other aspects of European political life;\n",
        "3. Takes the view that political parties at European level are a key element in the process of forming and voicing European public opinion, without which further development of the EU cannot succeed;\n",
        "4. Stresses the need for a genuine European party statute which goes further than the Regulation on the funding of political parties at European level, establishing their rights and obligations and enabling them to attain a legal personality based on Community law and effective in the Member States; calls for its Committee on Constitutional Affairs to consider the question of a European statute for European political parties from a legal and fiscal point of view and to draw up specific proposals to that end;\n",
        "5.  Urges that the statute should include provisions on individual membership of parties at European level, on their management, on the nomination of candidates and elections and on arrangements and support for party congresses and assemblies;\n",
        "6.  Notes that three actions were pending against the Regulation, which the Court of First Instance rejected as inadmissible on 11 July 2005, and that an appeal has been lodged against one of the judgments;\n",
        "7.  Welcomes the fact that since the beginning of this legislature after the European Parliament elections in June 2004, eight alliances of political parties from the Member States have formed political parties at European level and under the provisions of the Regulation were able to receive funding;\n",
        "8.  Notes that the allocation of € 4648 million in funding for the budget year 2004 began on 18 June 2004 with a call for submission of proposals and concluded with the Bureau's final decision on funding of 6 July 2005, in accordance with the Regulation;\n",
        "9.  Points out that the EU budget for 2005 included € 8.4 million for party funding, which the Bureau has distributed to the eight parties which submitted applications, in accordance with the provisions set out in the Regulation;\n",
        "10. Notes that political parties at European level in 2004 were charged a total of € 20 071 for technical support, i.e. rooms, technicians and particularly interpretation, which under the Regulation is provided by Parliament against payment;\n",
        "11. On the basis of practical experience to date, and in view of the budget guidelines, considers that the following changes should be made to the system of funding: (a) the Regulation lays down only the basic outline of the application procedure; to avoid an unnecessary burden on the applicants, it should be a two-stage procedure, firstly to decide whether a party in principle satisfies the conditions for support and secondly to determine the amount of funding; (b) the timing of the payment of funds is not in tune with the way the recipients work; it should be changed so that 80% of the funding is paid out on signature of the financial agreement and the remainder at the end of the budget year on the basis of an account submitted by the recipient; (c) to give recipients a greater degree of certainty in financial planning in the context of the binding budgetary principles laid down in the Financial Regulation, the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets, which draw up the annual budget proposals, should agree at the beginning of a legislature on a funding plan over several years, both with regard to the basic amount per party (15% of the total budget) and as to the additional amount per Member of European Parliament accounted for by the parties (85% of the total budget), and thus with sufficient flexibility to allow for any new parties; (d) the European political parties must be placed in a position to make longer-term financial plans; they must, therefore, be able to use any of their own funds, particularly those derived from donations and membership subscriptions, in excess of the prescribed 25% of their expenditure to be financed from their own funds, to build up reserves; (e) the current budget review procedure, or an amendment to the Regulation, should seek to introduce a limited exception which would allow 25% of funds granted for a budget year to be used in the first quarter of the following year; (f)  the strict division of funds between the five categories and the limited transfer of funds between them do not meet the needs of European parties; the financial agreement should therefore be changed so that a higher proportion of the funds can be transferred between the categories, on the understanding that the administrative burden in this procedure remains minimal; (g) in addition there should be a possibility of flexibility in the annual work programme submitted by the parties, so that they can react appropriately to unforeseen events in their political work; (h) in the interest of efficient management of funding, the deadline for the parties to submit their final accounts should be brought forward to 15 May of the following year; (i)  to achieve the aim of reinforcing European political parties as factors in European democracy, and against the background of increasing demands on their political work as a result of enlargements (costs of translation, travel, etc.), an appropriate increase in the financial support for political parties seems desirable;\n",
        "12. Considers that during the present phase of reflection on the future of the European Union, the following questions should also be discussed: (a) in what way can European political foundations be supported, to assist European political parties' work of political information and education? Parliament calls on the Commission to submit proposals on this matter; (b) in what way can European lists of European parties be established for the European elections, to further the formation of a European political public? (c) what role can European political parties play in referendums on European topics, in European Parliament elections and in the election of the Commission President? (d) in what way can the role of European political youth organisations and movements, which are a vital means of nurturing European awareness and shaping a European identity among the younger generations, be promoted and enhanced?\n",
        "13. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
