{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, in 1996 an underwear company closed its factory in my constituency. It left 160 unemployed – almost all women – of middle age, with little or no skills outside the factory. Only 100 of these women managed ever to work again. The women who found work needed, after 30 years of service in this plant, to begin again at minimum wage, as they had not been given any continuous training and their previous experience went unrecognised. This factory moved to a less expensive area of the EU and has since moved to Asia.\nCompanies will continue to relocate for cheaper labour forces, and we need to protect women – particularly in areas like textiles – by offering the opportunity to upskill and by giving continuous education.\nI also want to talk briefly about apprenticeships: in Ireland only 5% of women are in apprenticeships. It is a double problem. Are they encouraged to become plumbers and carpenters? Is there not also the problem that, in most areas, apprenticeships have now disappeared?\nApprenticeships themselves were a very good way to pass on information and skills and be recognised for them, and with the loss of apprenticeships we are denying many people – both men and women – the ability to pass on skills and be recognised.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, in 1996 an underwear company closed its factory in my constituency.
