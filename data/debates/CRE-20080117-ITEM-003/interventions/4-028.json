{"speaker": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the proposal before us deals with a very important issue, one that continues to spark debate globally. The role of women in industry affects all facets of society and has wide-ranging implications for employment and welfare policy, family and child policy, not to mention economic policy. Yes, equality legislation ensures women get maternity leave, but all the evidence shows that they expose themselves to promotional and financial discrimination, albeit subtly (to comply with the law) but nonetheless pervasively in an inflexible business culture.\nThere was an outcry in Ireland in recent weeks when a media accountant made this very point and he was roundly handbagged. There is no point denying the blindly obvious. Perhaps this report before us should be subtitled, ‘Motherhood and misogyny’, as an editorial in the Sunday Tribune at home screamed last week.\nWe in the European Parliament must endorse the proposal before us – with which I largely agree – because, on the one hand, industry needs women at all levels and, on the other hand, society needs children. We all – including employers and industrialists – must respect maternity and paternity leave as fundamental social values. While I still baulk at compulsory quotas for women’s participation, albeit in politics or business, my faith in a meritocracy is being sorely tested the older and, hopefully, the wiser I get.\nI would like to congratulate the rapporteur. There might be one or two paragraphs that I have to think about, but I will be supporting her report, and I think it behoves all of us in the House to support a very good report on which an awful lot of work has been done.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Avril Doyle (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the proposal before us deals with a very important issue, one that continues to spark debate globally.
