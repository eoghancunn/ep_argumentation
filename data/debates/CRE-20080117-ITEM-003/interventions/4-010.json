{"speaker": "Den Dover,", "english": "Den Dover, Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . − Mr President, I warmly welcome this report, which I fully support. The British Conservatives support it, as does the PPE-DE Group. If Europe is to play a leading part in a very competitive, a fiercely competitive, global world, we need all the resources available at the highest possible level.\nWhilst I disagree that there should be quotas saying how many ladies there should be at various levels in companies – and I particularly disagree with any compulsion in that regard – what I do want to see is as many ladies as possible rise to the highest possible levels based on their ability. It often depends on what we define as ‘industry’, and industry is changing; everything is much more flexible nowadays, and I am delighted that ladies are playing their role in industry in their various positions.\nI do not agree that there needs to be any handicap or under-representation in the new technologies, because ladies have the brains, the intelligence and the know-how to more than make their worth felt.\nFirstly, I would endorse the view that we should always go for equal pay wherever possible. Regarding this report, I was extremely pleased that the rapporteur embraced the views of people from the various groups and that we reached unanimity. I wanted to see better facilities for pensions for ladies – for portability within pensions from one employer to another to make sure they get higher pensions as they get through their working lives, and more flexibility in terms of facilities so that ladies can balance their family lives with their working lives.\nAs I say, I fully support this report. It is a step forward. We need ladies at all levels and I wish them well. I welcome in particular our new Commissioner, who is very capable indeed.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Den Dover, Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . − Mr President, I warmly welcome this report, which I fully support.
