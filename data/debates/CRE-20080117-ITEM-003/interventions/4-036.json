{"speaker": "Meglena Kuneva,", "english": "Meglena Kuneva, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, I wish to thank Members of for a very interesting discussion, and will take this opportunity to answer some of their questions.\nIn reply to Ms Figueiredo, it is true that the Equal programme finishes in 2008, but the European Social Fund Regulation for 2007-2013 incorporates gender equality as a horizontal priority.\nIn reply to Ms Bauer, we had the first reading of the important legislation issue you mentioned – the transferability of pension rights – in June 2007, and the EPSCO Council dealt with it in December 2007. We hope to make quick progress during 2008.\nIn reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki – I realise that she is not in the Chamber, but her question was very important, so I would like to answer it – the Commission adopted, in July 2007, the communication on ‘Tackling the pay gap between men and women’. In that communication, the Commission announced that in 2008 it would examine the relevance of current legislation from the point of view of the relevance of legal instruments with regard to the causes of the pay gap and, where necessary, propose amendments to the Community legal framework. Following this examination the Commission could propose any necessary changes to the current legal framework.\nIn reply to Ms Romeva i Rueda, anti-discrimination and gender equality legislation does not preclude Member States from developing and implementing positive actions. The Commission supports there being a higher proportion of women in decision-making. We will create a network of women in decision-making posts, probably during 2008.\nIn reply to Ms Flasarová, we cannot prevent companies from delocalising, but we have instruments to tackle that issue. In 2007, the European Globalisation Fund was quite promptly set up for this purpose.\nIn reply to Ms Ek, concerning statistics, the Commission continues to cooperate with Eurostat to develop specific statistics on equality. The Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions takes into account gender equality in its regular reports. In 2009, there will be a regular publication on the research statistics on women.\nIn reply to Mrs Doyle, concerning maternity leave, the Commission is to prepare an impact evaluation on possible legislative measures introducing new forms of leave – adoption leave, and leave to care for family members other than children.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Meglena Kuneva, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, I wish to thank Members of for a very interesting discussion, and will take this opportunity to answer some of their questions.\nIn reply to Ms Figueiredo, it is true that the Equal programme finishes in 2008, but the European Social Fund Regulation for 2007-2013 incorporates gender equality as a horizontal priority.\nIn reply to Ms Bauer, we had the first reading of the important legislation issue you mentioned – the transferability of pension rights – in June 2007, and the EPSCO Council dealt with it in December 2007.
