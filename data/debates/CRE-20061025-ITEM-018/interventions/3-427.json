{"speaker": "Derek Roland Clark,", "english": "Derek Roland Clark, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, when people work on short-term contracts in countries other than their own, there are obvious advantages for all sides. So I am all in favour of posted workers – but not this way. The report says in paragraph 19 that this will not be achieved by huge bureaucracy, but some 35 out of 49 paragraphs include references to laws, rules, infringement procedures, ECJ cases, enforcement by penalties.\nIf this proposal is anything to go by, I am not surprised that the Enterprise Commissioner is behind schedule in his drive to simplify EU laws! For yet again we have a proposal carrying a raft of rules and regulations, backed up with so many references to penalties and infringement procedures that the rapporteur must be at her wits’ end trying to make a proposal which is easy to operate, fair to all, but effective.\nWhen this was debated a while ago in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members were horrified to hear cases of blatant exploitation of posted workers. This must be stopped, but what were the Member States doing? What were the trade unions doing? After all, it is highly likely that local workers were also being abused. Were posted workers employed because local workers refused to accept the conditions on offer?\nThe key lies in recital L on page 5 of the report, which talks about preventing the circumvention of national standards. Since national standards are emphasised this way, why do we need an EU directive at all? Why is it not left to Member States, if it is their rules that control the situation? An EU directive will be a burden on all sides and produce delays, when all we want is people in work. After all, this is not a new situation. Posted workers did not come about because of the EU. They existed before there was an EU. My own brother, English like myself, was an engineering draughtsman. He became self-employed, took up a contract with Volkswagen and worked in Germany for several years. He had no problems at all, but that was before the UK joined the then EC.\nSo I repeat, we do not need this directive. Member States are perfectly capable of managing their affairs within the existing regulations of the European Union – in short, subsidiarity.
