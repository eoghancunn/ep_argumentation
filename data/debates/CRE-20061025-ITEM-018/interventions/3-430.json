So, apart from all the other difficulties highlighted by the rapporteur – and I do not have time to list them – it seems that we in Ireland do not have the legal certainty to comprehensively enforce this directive.\nRecent events in Ireland have shown how much we need full implementation of this directive: with GAMA, a Turkish construction company, ripping off some of its foreign workers; the Irish ferry scandal, where existing workers were simply replaced by mainly foreign workers on half the wages and with inferior working conditions – I might add that this is one of the reasons I support a directive on ferries; and today in Ireland the mushroom industry admitting that some of its members are paying half the minimum wage to their foreign workers.\nMy final point is that it is not just posted workers who suffer: it is all workers, including Irish workers, who will pay a price down the line, as minimum wages will be undercut and suspicion and distrust will replace solidarity between workers.
