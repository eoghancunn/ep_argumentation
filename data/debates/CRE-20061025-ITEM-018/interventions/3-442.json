One of the main obstacles is the need to adjust the definition of ‘employees’ so that a clear distinction is made with the status of ‘self employed persons’ for the purpose of national employment law. Another difficulty is that this directive has not been transposed by all the Member States, nor is it enforced in practice in a number of Member States. Also it is apparent that such workers do not even know their rights and therefore the aim of the directive is not being achieved. I have come across numerous Maltese who were working in other Member States and who have no idea of their rights under this directive. So as to make the directive meaningful, we must not be ambiguous.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Attard-Montalto (PSE). – Tonight we are debating the report on the application of a directive relating to posting of workers, as we are aware the posting of workers directive refers firstly to the guarantee of the free movement of persons and services, secondly, that posted employees enjoy terms and conditions related to minimum rates of pay, working conditions, health and safety of the host Member states.\nThe main problem of the directive is its enforcement.
