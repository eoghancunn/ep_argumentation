{"speaker": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). –", "english": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). – Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for a very good report.\nWe need an effective directive to protect workers posted temporarily to an EU state. This is essential to prevent a race to the bottom. However, we have a directive that is full of legal black holes and is not applied at all in some states.\nDespite the best efforts of Commissioner Špidla, I do not believe that guidelines will solve these failings. Many of our states are resisting the necessary legislative changes. The consequences are scandals of the kind already mentioned, such as the Irish ferries debacle. While ships’ crews are excluded from the posting of workers directive, the Irish Government also resists the implementation of a ferries directive, which would protect those workers.\nWe urgently need a legal framework to effectively prevent a race to the bottom, unfair competition and, indeed, the ugly emergence of xenophobia. We need clarity and certainty on definitions of workers and an end to false self-employment. We need the right to apply clearly established higher minimum standards, sufficient inspectors to ensure compliance and enforceable penalties for failure to comply with EU legislation. I believe, also, that we need protection for whistle-blowers, for those who reveal the abuses that take place under the existing regime.\nI should like to remind those who would criticise the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and myself over this issue that I represent a state that opened its borders to all ten new Member States, fully and freely. We have now been forced to close our borders to Bulgaria and Romania because of the abuse of migrant workers and the consequent effect upon Irish-based workers. This is not an easy question to resolve and it is certainly not an attempt to create protectionism in the 15 ‘old’ Member States.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). – Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for a very good report.\nWe need an effective directive to protect workers posted temporarily to an EU state.
