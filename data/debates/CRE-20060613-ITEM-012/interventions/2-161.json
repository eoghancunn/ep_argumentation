{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, Commissioner, we are spending hundreds of millions on the Tamiflu antiviral, without heeding the warning of Hanoi University Hospital. That hospital has probably dealt with more human victims of avian flu than anywhere else in the world, and the staff there tell us that Tamiflu is useless, that it does nothing.\nAs we learn about this flu, we move from a feeling of initial helplessness. We now know that the principal danger is not posed by migrating wild birds which we cannot control, but by domestic or, should I say, industrial fowl, and our handling of them and of their waste products. We can do something about that and I would refer you for a model to the example of Ireland’s actions in successfully containing the foot-and-mouth outbreak a few years ago. Farms had disinfectant baths and carpets at all entrances. Animal markets were closed and any movement of farm animals was closely monitored and largely stopped. We even cancelled our St Patrick’s Day parades, but the strategy of containment was successful and it can be successful again. We can hope to contain avian flu before it reaches a human-to-human transmission stage.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, Commissioner, we are spending hundreds of millions on the Tamiflu antiviral, without heeding the warning of Hanoi University Hospital.
