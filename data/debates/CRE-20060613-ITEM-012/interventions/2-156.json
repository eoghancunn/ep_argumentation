{"speaker": "Mary Honeyball,", "english": "Mary Honeyball, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Adamou, the rapporteur, on an excellent report. It is well balanced and rational, and draws sensible conclusions on how to deal with an event which we all very much hope will not happen. We have managed to avoid the bird flu pandemic so far. However, it is absolutely right to be prepared and to be prepared to work together and to ensure that we have the mechanisms in place to deal with a pandemic, should it occur. The fact that we have gone into this in a spirit of cooperation, that the Commission has talked about cooperation, and that we have encouraged discussion and debate in the Member States to ensure that all the basic things are in place – such as having enough vaccine should the worst happen – is a very good example of the European Union, this Parliament, the Commission and the Member States working together for the benefit of all the citizens of Europe.\nOne of the most important things that we, as elected representatives, are here to do is to ensure the safety of our constituents, the people whom we represent. This report, and the thought that has gone into what we should do if the worst happens and we have a pandemic, is a really good example of that.\nI should like to finish by highlighting an example of what has been going on in my own region, in London. I should like to offer particular thanks to the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which has carried out work in this area and helped with the development of antivirals and vaccines against this and other infectious diseases. I think we should hold this up as an example of what we have done here and of what institutions are doing in the Member States, and of how we can handle pandemics such as this one, which we hope will not actually take place.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mary Honeyball, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Adamou, the rapporteur, on an excellent report.
