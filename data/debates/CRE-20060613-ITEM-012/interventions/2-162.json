{"speaker": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). –", "english": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I want to begin by warmly welcoming Mr Adamou's report, which we wholeheartedly support. I welcome what the Commissioner has said about the steps being taken as, indeed, I welcome the report that has been referred to by Mr Koker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I want to highlight three aspects.\nThe first is vaccine research. What is clear is that if we rely on the egg-based vaccine, even once we know the strain of the flu, it will take six to eight months for that to come on stream. And if the flu pandemic has come as a result of bird flu or hen flu, we are likely to have slaughtered all the hens, which means there will be no eggs for vaccines. So, there is an urgent need to research alternatives and in particular the DNA vaccine and I look forward to hearing what is happening on that.\nSecondly, on preparedness: this excellent report covers a wide range of matters which need to be put into operation. There is one missing, I think, which concerns the devices to deliver the vaccines. I hope that will be included in the work being done in the Commission.\nThirdly, on the stockpile: Mr Staes asked for the names of the countries which are blocking the stockpile. I will give them to him: it is the Netherlands, it is Sweden and it is Slovakia. In addition, we had Britain, Germany and Portugal giving conditional support, depending on who was going to pay for it. I think that is based on a misunderstanding of what the stockpile is supposed to be. It is not meant to replace the work of the Member States, it is not meant to save them from having to build their own stockpiles; it is an insurance policy against the possibility that we will have an urgent situation within or perhaps outside our borders – for instance, in Moldova or Belarus, in which case it would be in all our interests to smother that outbreak as quickly as possible, before it spreads to the European Union. For that reason, I beg the Commissioner to go back to the Council, explain what it is all about, knock heads together and make sure that those countries that have been blocking it to date remove that block so that we have this stockpile ready to protect ourselves.", "lang": "EN", "original": "John Bowis (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I want to begin by warmly welcoming Mr Adamou's report, which we wholeheartedly support.
