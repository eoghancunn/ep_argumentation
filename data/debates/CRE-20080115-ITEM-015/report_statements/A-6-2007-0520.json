        "78. Highlights the fact that a large majority of child victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation reasons such as prostitution and the production of child pornography,  as well as in the case of forced marriages, are teenage girls, which consequently makes human trafficking a major gender issue; emphasises, moreover, that even within groups involved with attempts to control and stop human trafficking, conventional attitudes about the relationship between the sexes and traditional perceptions of the roles of women and girls are still present;\n",

        "92. Stresses that Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that ‘In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration’; a reading of the Hague Convention on Child Abduction demonstrates that the interests of the child are understood to mean a rapid return after abduction; however, the interests of the child encompass more than simply a rapid return, for example a secure direct physical environment, a climate of affection, a supportive, flexible family structure, appropriate role modelling by parents, continuity of upbringing and care, as well as decent living conditions; the Hague Convention on Child Abduction takes no account of these criteria, for example, it does not consider who the abducting parent is, whether or not they provide adequate care, how old the child is, how long the child has already spent in the other country, whether the child goes to school and has made friends there, etc. The conclusion is that despite the ‘good’ intentions of the Hague Convention on Child Abduction and the new Brussels II Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003), the rights of the child are often not well protected; calls on the Commission to take action to guarantee the rights of the child better here too, and urges it to make proposals to this effect;\n",
        "93. Calls for appropriate and swift measures to be taken to look for and identify missing and abducted children; including the use of the Schengen Information System to prevent them from crossing borders; welcomes the European communications hotline for missing children and the corresponding action of NGOs and encourages the Commission to promote the creation of a European open telephone agency for children and young people with problems;\n",
        "94. Calls on the EU institutions and the Member States to implement UN General Assembly resolutions A/RES/46/121, A/RES/47/134 and A/RES/49/179 on human rights and extreme poverty, A/RES/47/196 on observance of an international day for the eradication of poverty, et A/RES/50/107, on observance of the International Year for  the Eradication of  Poverty and  proclamation of the first  United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, and Un Economic and Social Council documents E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/13, E/CN4/1987/NGO/2, E/CN4/1987/SR.29 and E/CN.4/1990/15, on human rights and extreme poverty, E/CN.4/1996/25, on the right to development and E/CN.4/SUB.2/RES/1996/25 on the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights;\n",
        "95. Recalls that 19% of children in the European Union live below the poverty line and that appropriate assistance measures geared to the needs of children must therefore be taken, including measures to support their families and calls on the Member States to adopt ambitious and achievable targets for reducing - and eventually eradicating - child poverty;\n",
        "96. Advocates creating suitable structures in the Member States for helping children and parents adapt to changed family circumstances;\n",
        "97. Calls on the Commission to take steps to allow children to enjoy their childhood years and take part in children’s activities without suffering social discrimination or exclusion;\n",

        "99. Calls on the Commission to seek integration of strategies specifically addressing child poverty, youth unemployment and social inclusion of minorities within all relevant development strategies including Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Indicative Programmes;\n",
        "100.    Calls on the institutions concerned to provide children with an opportunity to make a real contribution to fighting poverty; calls, with a view to combating children's poverty more effectively, for all the parties concerned, including the poorest children, to be given a genuinely active part in the planning, setting up and evaluation of such projects to eradicate extreme poverty;\n",
        "101.    Stresses that action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children – i.e. trafficking in children for sexual purposes, child pornography and child sex tourism should be made one of the strategy’s major objectives for action both within and outside the European Union, in particular in the light of the Millennium Development Goals; points out that poverty is often one of the many causes of and reinforces social exclusion, discrimination and endangering of children; takes the view, however, that commercial sexual exploitation of children has its real origin in the demand for sex with children and in organised crime, which is prepared to exploit situations that place children at risk;\n",
        "102.    Calls for consideration to be given to providing psycho-social care and emotional support to children living in difficult situation such as armed conflict and crisis situations, displaced children or children living in extreme poverty;\n",
        "103.    Calls on the Member States to exercise their duty to assist and protect all children against the risks of malnutrition, disease and abuse, whatever their social and/or legal status or that of their parents;\n",

        "106.    Welcomes the existence of many NGOs and voluntary workers, which create friendship and solidarity ties between the least-favoured children and children from different social backgrounds in order to combat extreme poverty and social exclusion; calls on the EU institutions and the Member States to ensure that the poorest children can also benefit from Community projects and that the European Voluntary Service's projects provide such organisations with more opportunities to take on young voluntary workers;\n",
        "107.    Calls for Roma children and children belonging to other national minoritiesin particular to be covered by targeted measures, in particular with a view to ending the discrimination, segregation, social and school exclusion and exploitation of which they are often victims; calls also on the Member States to make efforts to eliminate the overrepresentation of Roma children in institutions for mentally disabled; calls also for the promotion of schooling campaigns, measures to combat the high levels of early school leaving and preventive health protection and assistance projects, including vaccinations;\n",
        "108.    Takes the view that the EU should set itself the objective of ensuring that there are no homeless children or street children in the EU; calls for appropriate and targeted measures to be taken to assist homeless children and street children, since most of them are badly traumatised and socially excluded, do not receive formal education or health care, are particularly vulnerable to becoming the victims of human trafficking (such as prostitution, organ trafficking and illegal adoption), drug addiction and crime or are often forced to beg;\n",
        "109.    Asks the Commission and the Member States to recognise the thousands of street children and children forced to beg as a serious social and human rights issue and also calls on the Member States to introduce sanctions against those responsible for the degradation of children forced to beg;\n",
        "110.    Calls on the European Union, the Member States and organised civil society associations to ensure that each child is given the opportunity to form part of a children's group or association in order to meet other children and thinks with them; calls, on this basis, for support measures taken by adults seeking to ensure that every child feels part of the group and can express himself within it, to be set up; calls therefore on the Member States and relevant local authorities to encourage projects which are aimed at enabling children to express themselves in this way, such as children's local councils or parliaments, while ensuring that the most excluded children are involved;\n",
        "111.    Calls for consideration to be given to the possibility of devising a Community instrument on adoptions, developed in conformity with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international standards, that improves the quality of care with regard to information services, the preparation of international adoptions, the processing of international adoption applications and post-adoption services,bearing in mind that all international conventions on the protection of children's rights recognise the right of abandoned children and orphans to have a family and be protected;\n",
        "112.    Calls on the Member States to act in order to guarantee the basic right of children to have a family; urges the Member States, therefore, to act in order to identify effective solutions to prevent the abandonment of children and offset the placement of abandoned children and orphans in institutions; when finding a new solution for a child, the best interest of the child, as laid down in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, should always be the primary consideration;\n",
        "113.    Takes the view that adoption can take place within the national country of the child, or by finding a family through international adoption, in accordance with national legislation and international conventions, placement in institutions should only be used as a temporary solution. Alternative family care solutions could be foster families; urges the Member States and the Commission, in cooperation with the Hague Conference, the Council of Europe and children's organisations, to establish a framework to ensure transparency, effective monitoring of these children's development and to coordinate their actions in order to prevent child trafficking; urges the Member States, in this context, to give special consideration to children with special needs, e.g. children in need of medical treatment and disabled children;\n",
        "114.    Emphasises the social exclusion experienced by many perpetrators who are minors, which in many cases makes their smooth social reintegration impossible; encourages Member States, therefore, to introduce measures in favour of young adults who were previously in orphanages or child care establishments so that they benefit from support measures to help them plan their professional future and facilitate their integration into society;\n",
        "115.    Observes that those children who are acting as carers for parents or siblings with specific needs should be entitled to specific targeted support;\n",
        "116.      Points out that the future EU strategy should recognise the important role of the family as the basic institution in society for the survival, protection and development of the child; takes the view that the full account should be taken of children's rights in issues regarding the conciliation of work and family life and working time, with particular focus on the circumstances of mothers with disabilities and mothers of children with disabilities, as well as in the formulation of  policies for the public and/or private support of the children and their parents in order that both parents are able to take on and share  responsibility for bringing up and caring for their children; is of the opinion that recognition should be given to the fact that an increasing number of people now live in alternative family structures that do not correspond to the traditional nuclear family, consisting of a mother and father and their biological children;\n",
        "117.    Takes the view that children's rights should be taken into account fully in the conciliation of work and family life and working time issues;\n",
        "118.    Urges the Member States to remove all restrictions on the right of parents to have contact with their children resulting from nationality differences, particularly in connection with the choice to speak a language other than the official language within a given country; takes the view that the removal of restrictions on multinational families in which there is a conflict between the parents should entail unrestricted freedom to speak in the language chosen by the child and the parent, with due respect for any requirements that meetings be supervised which may have been imposed by the courts;\n",
        "119.    Welcomes the introduction of children's ombudsmen and calls on all Member States to facilitate such an introduction at national and local level;\n",

        "121.    Calls on the Commission to ensure that deliberations by human rights committees and sub-groups set up under trade and cooperation agreements focus on the problem of child labour and the protection of children from all forms of abuse, exploitation and discrimination;\n",
        "122.    Emphasises the need to ensure that all policies, both internal and external, both at Member State and at EU level, should have regard to the elimination of child labour in all its forms; believes that full-time education is the best means to tackle the problem, for girls as well as boys, both in terms of preventing such abuse and also in breaking the cycle of illiteracy and poverty into the future;\n",
        "123.    Strongly condemns all forms of child labour, slavery and bonded labour and other forms of work which adversely affect children's health and safety; calls on the Commission and the Council to link the European Union's trade with, and development aid to, third countries more closely to such countries' implementation of the ILO Convention on the prohibition of, and immediate measures to eliminate all forms of child labour;\n",
        "124.    Points to the fact that products being sold in the EU may be produced by child labour; calls on the Commission to implement a mechanism by which victims of child labour can seek redress against European companies in the national courts of the Member States; calls on the Commission to enforce supply-chain compliance and especially to come forward with mechanisms that make the main contractor liable in Europe in cases of violation of UN conventions on child labour in the supply chain; to this end, calls on the EU to use the generalised system of preferences (GSP) procedure as one way of combating more effectively the exploitation of child labour which occurs in various regions of the world, with special measures for dangerous work which a large number of children are forced to do;\n",
        "125.    Calls for special attention to be given, and in the best interests of the child, to the situation of refugee, asylum-seeking and migrant children, and children whose parents are asylum seekers, refugees or illegal immigrants, to ensure that such children can enjoy their rights regardless of the legal status of their parents and that they do not suffer from the adverse effects of a situation for which they bear no responsibility, and that their special needs are addressed;taking special care to preserve family unity in case it is the best interest of the child;\n",
        "126.    Calls for unaccompanied minors to be paid special attention in the context of all forms of immigration, since organised crime makes use of every opportunity to bring a child into a country in order to exploit it; takes the view that Member States should therefore be vigilant and ensure that there are child protection policies for every imaginable situation;\n",
        "127.    Is concerned at the multiple violations of rights affecting girls from a migrant background; urges Member States to ban headscarves and hijab at least at primary school, in order to anchor more firmly the right to be a child and to ensure genuine and unenforced freedom of choice at a later age;\n",
        "128.    Calls for access to education for immigrant children and for the establishment of programmes and resources, from an intercultural perspective, with particular focus on situations of vulnerability and unaccompanied minors;\n",
        "129.    Points out that international standards on child protection are applicable to unaccompanied minors arriving in European Union territory via irregular immigration procedures; calls on all local, regional and national authorities and on the EU institutions to cooperate as far as possible in protecting these unaccompanied minors; calls on the Commission to establish international cooperation and assistance procedures with the third countries of origin so as to ensure that minors are properly returned to these countries and calls for mechanisms to be established to protect these minors once they have returned to their countries or origin, both within their biological families and through mechanisms or institutions that will offer them effective protection;\n",
        "130.    Calls, in the context of the adoption, under the codecision procedure, of new instruments on which the common asylum system will be based, for the protection of children's rights to be given a prominent position and for specific measures to be drawn up for them, taking due account of their vulnerability and providing, in particular, adequate access for children to the asylum system, guidance to child-related procedures, due regard to the individual grounds for asylum of a child within an asylum seeking family and broader scope for family reunification within the asylum process;\n",
        "131.    Draws attention to the particular situation of migrant children separated from both their parents or their previous legal or customary primary caregiver and calls to consider the need for a dedicated EU measure addressing the right to assistance of all lone children, addressing access to the territory, appointment and role of guardians, the right to be heard, conditions of reception and family tracing measures and potentially might also address durable solutions;\n",
        "132.    Draws attention to the fact that children unaccompanied by adults, stateless children, as well as children not registered at birth, are at particular risk and calls on the Member States to take special measures on the basis of what is best for the individual child, as defined, in particular, by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and by the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees;\n",
        "133.    Draws attention to the role of education, which should be egalitarian and without the use of violence or corporal punishment; urges the Commission to allocate the resources needed to prevent violence of any kind in refugee communities, especially gender violence and sexual exploitation, by setting up programmes for education and awareness-raising on gender issues, human rights, sexual and reproductive health, female genital mutilation and HIV/Aids, targeted at minors of both sexes;\n",
        "134.    Stresses that there is a discrepancy between what the law requires and what is actually practised as regards the implementation of European asylum instruments and that huge differences remain in the way children with refugee status are treated in the different Member States;\n",
        "135.    Highlights the fact that 5% of asylum seekers are unaccompanied minors, which indicates the need to appoint well-trained legal guardians for unaccompanied children to represent their best interests following their arrival in the host country; calls for an improvement in living conditions for children in reception facilities; is disappointed by the lack of child-sensitive asylum procedures;\n",
        "136.    Notes that many of the risks faced by refugee children are equally faced by children who have been forcibly displaced within the borders of their own countries;\n",
        "137.    Insists that children should only be returned to their country of origin when their safety and security are assured, and emphasises the need for family tracing and family reunification; stresses that their return must be prohibited where there is a danger of serious harm being done, through, for example, child labour, sexual exploitation, violence or the risk of female genital mutilation, social exclusion or involvement in armed conflict;\n",
        "138.    Stresses the need to improve the data collection on children seeking refugee status, children residing illegally in the territory of another state but not seeking refugee status and the outcome of asylum procedures and the future of such children following the adoption of a final positive or negative decision on their asylum request, in order to ensure that such children do not disappear into obscurity or become the victims of crime;\n",
        "139.    Underlines the negative consequences of emigration and the precarious situation of children left alone in their countries by parents who have emigrated; stresses the need to ensure comprehensive care, integration and education for such children, as well as family reintegration whenever possible;\n",
        "140.    Calls on the Commission to make a study on the possibility of offering European citizenship to children born in the EU regardless of the legal status of their parents;\n",
        "141.    Recalls that administrative detention of children should be an exceptional measure; stresses that children accompanied by their families should be detained only as a last resort, for the shortest possible period of time and only if such detention is in their best interests, pursuant to Article 37(b) of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, and that unaccompanied minors should not be detained or sent back;\n",

        "144.    Calls on the Commission and Member States to facilitate access for young girls to information and education about reproductive health and reproductive health services;\n",
        "145.    Urges Member States to take every necessary measure to ensure the quality of their childcare facilities, including continuous professional training as well as training in children's rights, good working conditions and a decent pay for those caring professionally for children as these facilities and their staff provide children with a strong foundation for their future, whilst also being of benefit to parents, particularly with regard to the workload of working and single parents - this in turn contributes to a decrease in poverty among women and subsequently among children;\n",
        "146.    Calls on the Commission and Member States to make a concerted effort to help partner countries to achieve the target of free, universal primary education (MDG 2) and calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide the necessary funding for the Education for All - Fast Track Initiative;\n",

        "157.    Notes that providing early care for children in collective institutions (crèches, schools) is one of the best ways of solving the problem of balancing working and family life and is also a means of ensuring, at an early stage of children's development, that they have the benefit of equal opportunity and become socialised;\n",
        "158.               Points out that the banning of girls from taking part in school tuition and sports such as swimming on cultural grounds is not justified by any culture or religion and must not be tolerated;\n",

        "161.    Calls for Member States and their relevant authorities to do their utmost to ensure that children experience a healthy physical environment, given the disproportionate effect that pollution and poor living conditions have on the young; due attention should also be paid to conditions of children's learning environment, and appropriate standards should be introduced;\n",
        "162.               Recalls children's right to health and, in particular, adolescents' right to sexual and reproductive health and stresses that the protection of maternal health must be an integral part of the future strategy on the rights of the child, which should promote living and working conditions suitable for pregnant and breastfeeding women and insist on compliance with the existing legislation protecting the rights of female workers, as well as equal and universal access for all women to quality pre- and post-natal care in the public sector in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality and transmission of diseases from mother to child; stresses the vital importance that maternity leave has for a child's development, particularly on account of the child's bond with its mother not only during the early months following birth but also during the first years of its life;\n",
        "163.               Welcomes the fact that the Commission recognises that children, from birth to adulthood, have very different needs at different developmental stages of their lives; recalls children's right to the highest attainable standard of health and, specifically, adolescents' right to sexual and reproductive health and family planning education and services and that it must therefore be an integral part of the future strategy on the rights of the child;\n",
        "164.    Notes that children's rights, as laid down in the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, refer to all human beings below the age of 18 and that specific needs on sexual and reproductive health and rights of adolescents have to be acknowledged;\n",
        "165.    Underlines the importance of promoting policies on sexual and reproductive health in order to reduce and possibly avoid sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS), unwanted pregnancies and illegal and unsafe abortions for young women, and avoid lack of understanding on the part of young people of their reproductive health needs;\n",
        "166.    Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take steps to protect children whose parents suffer from AIDS and highlights the need to meet MDG 5 (to improve maternal health), MDG 4 (to reduce child mortality) and MDG 6 (to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other disease); also urges investment in research into and development of paediatric anti-retroviral formulations, in the provision of anti-malarial bednets and in the promotion of immunisation through the GAVI Alliance (formerly known as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation);\n",
        "167.    Calls the Member States to provide sexual education, information and counselling in order to increase the awareness and respect for one's sexuality, and to prevent unwanted pregnancies and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STDs, and to facilitate the access of and information of different contraceptives;\n",

        "170.               Calls on the Commission and the Member States to increase their efforts to combat alcohol-related harm for women and children, by: a)   providing better information to women on foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, b)   providing adequate health service and counselling for women with alcohol problems during and after pregnancy as well as for women and children in families with alcohol and substance-abuse problems, c)   introducing stronger regulations on advertisement for alcoholic beverages and sponsoring of sport events by the alcohol industry, in the form of advertisement prohibitions between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., and by prohibiting alcohol advertisements with children's content (computer games, comics), so as to not communicate a positive image of alcohol to children, and d)   prohibiting alcohol beverages which in their design are hardly different from sweets or toys, since children cannot make the distinction between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages;\n",
        "171.    Calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure that conditions are created to enable every child to have access to all kinds and levels of health service, and where necessary to take positive measures to enable disadvantaged groups to benefit from healthcare service options from which they would otherwise remain excluded;\n",

        "175.    Recognises that birth certificates help to protect a child against rights violations that stem from doubts about his/her age or identity;considers that reliable birth registration systems hinder the trafficking of children and their organs, curb illegal adoption and prevent the overestimation of a child's age for the purposes of early marriage, under-age military recruitment, sexual exploitation, child labour[14]and the judicial treatment of minors as adults;\n",
        "176.    Highlights the fact that the \"invisibility\" of non-registered children increases their vulnerability and the likelihood that violations of their rights will go unnoticed;\n",
        "177.    Deplores the existence in some countries of gender discrimination in birth registration, with laws and practices operating that are contrary to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and which include the denial of registration to single mothers, refusal of the mother’s nationality and discrimination in the registration of girls without a school education where access to registration is based on the education system;\n",
        "178.    Calls on the Commission and on both children's rights and humanitarian aid organisations to join in action to raise awareness of the need for birth registration in third countries; notes that the absence of a birth certificate may prevent children from obtaining recognition of possible inheritance rights and from gaining access to education, healthcare services and material assistance from the state; calls for the promotion of measures to ensure that such services are provided universally until the completion of the official registration process;\n",
        "179.    Calls on the Commission to urge states to establish permanent registration systems operating from the national to village level, available free of charge to the entire population including those living in remote areas, through the provision o, inter alia,  mobile registration units where appropriate, adequate training for civil registrars and the allocation of sufficient resources to finance these initiatives;\n",
