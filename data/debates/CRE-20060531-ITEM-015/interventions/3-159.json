{"speaker": "Sajjad Karim,", "english": "Sajjad Karim, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, one of the most important achievements of the 20th century was the lifting of millions out of poverty. The emergence of China and India on the global trading scene played a huge role in this feat and they continue to lead the developing world by example. But the challenge is far from over. Even today, 49% of the population in LDCs still live on less than a dollar a day. By 2015, 471 million of them will be living in extreme poverty. Trade liberalisation is vital if we are to lift these people out of devastating poverty.\nBut trade is not a magic bullet. The critical challenge is how to promote poverty reduction in a newly-liberalised open economy. The majority of LDCs are still galloping in the dark in this regard. Free trade is not the same as laissez-faire . The fundamental priority must be for governments to implement macro-economic strategies that integrate trade in a way that effectively supports poverty reduction. We must help them to do this through increasing assistance and improving its effectiveness. This is not basic aid plunging the developing world into further debt: this is investment – investment in infrastructure, technology, human capital and the global trading system itself.\nFinally, in return, we will enjoy greater openness and competitiveness and the LDCs will benefit from greater capital accumulation and technological progress. These will form the engine of growth. International trade will be the fuel for that engine, and together we can accelerate towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Sajjad Karim, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, one of the most important achievements of the 20th century was the lifting of millions out of poverty.
