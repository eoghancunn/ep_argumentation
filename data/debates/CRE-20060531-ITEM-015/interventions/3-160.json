{"speaker": "Peter Mandelson,", "english": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I find myself very strongly in accord with those who have spoken in this short but important debate. Its themes have been those of free trade and fair trade. Those are the twin pillars that support our policy objectives. Whilst bilateral trade agreements have their place, it is multilateral trade negotiations in a multilateral framework for the international trading system that, in our view, are best able to bring equity and balance to the international trading system.\nThat is why the Doha Development Agenda is so important. It has at its heart the ideal of free trade contributing to poverty reduction in the world. As somebody once said, the victory of ideals has to be organised and, as one of the speakers tonight said, we want to see an organised liberalisation of trade. We do not want to see a jungle in which the rules of that jungle operate to the detriment of developing countries and the poor in the world. That is what the Commission is pursuing on behalf of Member States and I strongly believe that this report will guide us in these continuing efforts to achieve trade justice in the world, which is why I welcome it so strongly.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Peter Mandelson, Member of the Commission .
