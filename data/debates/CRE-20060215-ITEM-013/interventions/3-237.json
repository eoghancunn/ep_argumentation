{"speaker": "Jim Higgins (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Jim Higgins (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the report on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector is welcome and could not be more timely. There has been a radical shift in agricultural activity, brought about by the agricultural reforms of 2003, and the opening-up of markets as a result of the WTO. While benefits have undoubtedly flowed for farmers, there has been – as has been said repeatedly this evening – a greater and real increase in the risk factors. Under the new CAP, the risk and crisis measures that we had all become used to were dismantled and the onus on the protection, prevention and management of crises has shifted squarely onto the farmers’ shoulders.\nOpen markets and product mobility increase the possibility of the spread of disease. Climate change is happening very quickly, so that reorientation will be inevitable. The depletion of oil stocks means that fertilisers, pesticides and machinery will all be affected in due course and, by extension, agriculture will be affected and will have to adapt.\nIn Ireland, the nitrates directive, for example, is beginning to bite and having such serious consequences that the farming organisations have withdrawn from the government-sponsored social and economic partnership talks. Farming is in transition as never before. It is in transition because of a variety of factors and the transition will continue. Farming is confronted with more risks than ever before. Good farming practice and a stable and experienced farming population are the best guarantee for what Europe needs, which is a safe, secure and healthy food supply. Farming is a difficult life: long hours, hard work, high investment and many risks. In many cases it is a whole family transaction. It deserves the protection against risks proposed by the rapporteur in this report.\nI commend the rapporteur and his report. I support him completely, particularly in relation to option 2, and I welcome the Commissioner’s comments this evening.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jim Higgins (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the report on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector is welcome and could not be more timely.
