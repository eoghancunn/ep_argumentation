The debacle that Britain suffered during the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, is eloquent testimony to what happens when crises are managed by the EU. It is not widely known that the strategy for dealing with that disaster was managed by the then Commissioner for Agriculture, and what a complete pig’s breakfast he made of that. Millions of healthy animals were needlessly slaughtered in an orgy of killing and burning that shocked the world.
