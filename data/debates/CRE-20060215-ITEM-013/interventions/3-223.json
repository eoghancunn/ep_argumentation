{"speaker": "Mariann Fischer Boel,", "english": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, especially the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their work on risk and crisis management and the very useful resolution and report. I will, of course, study your position and the different proposals in the report carefully.\nMy intention with the communication on risk and crisis management presented in March 2005 was to launch a comprehensive debate. I think that objective has been successfully achieved, in the Council, in the European Economic and Social Committee and now in the European Parliament. Your contribution will be essential for the progress of our work.\nI therefore take note of your position regarding the three options for new rural development measures to support risk and crisis management. I welcome your encouragement to continue the work on the subject. I note your particular interest in option 2, which concerns mutual funds.\nIn the shorter term, I share your views concerning the fruit and vegetables sector and I have already said to the Council that we are going to examine the subject of risk and crisis management in the context of the future reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.\nAs you have noticed, however, the subject of risk and crisis management is really very complex, notably because the purpose is to adapt to a changing international trade context in respect of WTO rules. We therefore need to study this area further.\nAs regards the analytical background, at the beginning of 2005 we launched a research project on risk and crisis management instruments for EU agriculture. The work is well advanced and we should have some intermediate results in the coming year.\nWe are also preparing a study on the agricultural insurance systems in the various Member States and the technical issue of insurance systems in agriculture. This was specifically requested by the European Parliament. It is essential to describe and analyse what is done at Member State level before eventually deciding whether we need to set up permanent European instruments for insurance possibilities. We will then have a good basis for discussion during the coming year, which will facilitate the detailed political debate that is essential before we agree on additional measures. I am quite sure that, after listening to your comments, I will be able to respond directly to some of the questions raised.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mariann Fischer Boel, Member of the Commission .
