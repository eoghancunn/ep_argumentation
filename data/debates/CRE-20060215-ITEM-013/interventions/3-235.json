{"speaker": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report. It is good to see the Commissioner here this evening, because the Commission has put forward a flexible approach to crisis management in agriculture. Animal diseases and natural disasters are going to happen and we must find a flexible approach to these. The CAP reform is now moving towards offering help for farmers to help themselves. That really has to be the way forward.\nIf you take what happened with the foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, the huge sums of money that were needed to eradicate the disease could never have been funded by an insurance company on its own. We should perhaps look at a form of insurance with the Member State and the European Union as the insurer of last resort, so that they can actually step in when there are huge disasters.\nMr Graefe zu Baringdorf referred to young farmers in his report. There is a special case for a certain amount of extra help for those setting up business early on in their career, because they do not have the capital behind them and they need extra support.\nIf Mr Titford had still been in the Chamber, I would have liked to take him up on his comment that Commissioner Fischler and the European Commission were to blame for the mishandling of the foot-and-mouth crisis. Had he been part of the inquiry here in the European Parliament, he would have found that was not the case. I have to admit to you that the blame lay with the UK Government and a Prime Minister who was hell bent on calling a general election and wanted to get the disease under control. He had a huge contiguous cull of millions of animals that was completely unnecessary. We could have used vaccines, which were also ruled out. I would have liked to put Mr Titford right on that and other points.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neil Parish (PPE-DE). – Mr President, I thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report.
