{"speaker": "Joe Borg,", "english": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur, Ms Attwooll, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report, the contents of which I can almost fully endorse.\nThe report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries. This is a crucial issue in the present context, where poor economic performance is the rule rather than the exception. The quest for a higher degree of economic efficiency generally has very positive effects on overcapacity and hence on sustainability of fisheries activities.\nThe report, however, also accurately identifies the possible negative effects. In my opinion, such effects could be contained, if not eliminated, by introducing provisions intended to limit concentration of rights, to deal with allocation issues and, as proposed by the report, to protect artisanal fleets. These are being dealt with by various means in third countries where rights-based management systems in general, and individual transferable quotas in particular, have been in place for quite some time. As stated in the report, such systems are a complex matter, but difficulties associated with them are not insurmountable.\nOn balance, I think the possible benefits are larger than the possible negative effects. However, I would like to confirm once more that the Commission has no intention of proposing Community management systems. Nor is it the Commission’s intention to promote a given and universal rights-based management system. Different fisheries will require different systems. I am also fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue in relation to relative stability.\nThe Commission will continue working on this issue. In the short term, we are aiming at increasing the general knowledge on rights-based management and identifying best practices to be shared with Member States’ national or regional governments with fisheries competences. We will also consider issuing guidelines or similar supporting documents to that effect.\nThe results of the consultation process – including, of course, the report of the European Parliament – and the outcome of the ongoing study on rights-based management systems in the Member States and experiences in third countries will be important inputs for this process.\nIn the medium term, rights-based management is going to be one of the topics in our reflection towards the next reform of the common fisheries policy.\nThe Commission will keep you informed about these future developments and I look forward to further fruitful discussions with you on this important issue.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joe Borg, Member of the Commission . − Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur, Ms Attwooll, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report, the contents of which I can almost fully endorse.\nThe report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries.
