    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the fact that the Commission has opened a debate on Rights-Based Management (RBM) in fisheries in anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy;\n",
        "2.  Considers that marine biological resources are a common public good;\n",
        "3.  Believes that the rights involved should not be understood as property rights but as a kind ofusufructor a right to harvest and subject, accordingly, to appropriate limitations;\n",
        "5.  Welcomes the fact that the Commission has put out a call for tenders to allow for a full study of the various management systems;\n",
        "6.  Considers that the period of debate fixed is too short and calls for it to be extended to ensure that the various possibilities available are properly explored and studied, along with their consequences;\n",
        "7.  Recognises, however, even in advance of such a study, that it is evident that there is a wide variety of such systems in place and that most, if not all, employ some form of RBM, if this is taken in its widest sense; recognises, likewise, that experiments with management through fishing rights in Member States which have applied such systems have had very positive consequences in many respects, for example in terms of capacity reduction;\n",
        "8.  Considers that it is similarly evident that, at Community level and within at least some of the Member States, the forms of RBM employed are hybrid ones, in terms both of the allocation and transferability/tradability of the rights and of the way in which their extent is defined;\n",
        "9.  Notes the degree of complexity involved and the difficulties this poses for movement toward a single system, whether achieved through harmonising the practices of Member States or by its administration at Community level;\n",
        "10. Nevertheless takes the view, that, as shown by the fact that rights-based management in fisheries has been introduced in many of the countries and regions which have the most significant fishing interests in the world, these difficulties are not insurmountable and, given that the system could prove highly positive for the management of certain Community fleets, consideration should at least be given to the possibilities for including it in the CFP;\n",
        "11. Considers it necessary to ascertain the effects which changes, particularly the introduction of Community-wide Individual Transferable Quotas and other rights-based access, might have in relation to:\n",
        "14. Wonders also whether a single system of RBM would in any event be appropriate for different types of fishery;\n",
        "15. Draws attention in this context to: the different requirements of single species and multi-species fisheries; and to the special situation of artisanal fleets;\n",
        "16. Considers, in relation to the latter, that separate provision should be made for them, either using criteria linked to geographical distance from the coast or by setting part of the quota aside for them;\n",
        "17. Welcomes, therefore, the fact that the Commission has no present intention of intervening in current management systems;\n",
        "18. Considers, however, that further consideration should nonetheless be given to the advantages and disadvantages of different RBM systems;\n",
        "19. Considers it necessary to prevent economic distortions in the fishing industry to the detriment of small shipowners, in particular those representing artisanal fishing;\n",
        "20. Acknowledges that such systems may promote economic efficiency, provided that they are properly devised; points out that this efficiency is an objective of any economic policy and it is in the CFP's interests to secure a profitable fishing industry that is less and less dependent on public funds;\n",
        "21. Considers that, given that fisheries is a common policy, fishing right management mechanisms should be adopted at Community level that will make it possible to improve the management of fishery resources;\n",
        "22. Believes that economic efficiency is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission accordingly to ensure that any studies which it initiates on RBM should be directed at:\n",
        "24. Urges the Commission to allow a longer period for debate on this issue;\n",
        "25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture.\n"
