{"speaker": "Bairbre de Brún,", "english": "Bairbre de Brún, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, Liz Lynnes’s report highlights the need for a comprehensive, legislative framework which would prevent discrimination outside of the workplace and which would include a wide range of subjects.\nMillions of people are discriminated against – the elderly as well as other groups – everyday in the European Union as they try to access health, education and transport services or try to buy insurance or apply for a loan.\nThese same groups had difficulties as regards employment before the introduction of stronger legislation at the European level. Effective legislation at European Union level changed employers' attitudes. It was a European directive which forced Member States to try to end discrimination in employment – although there is still a lot work to be done yet. Comprehensive legislation must be undertaken at a European level in order to strengthen people’s rights in terms of goods and services.\nI would like to praise the rapporteur for her report and I would like to ask my fellow members to vote against amendments which weaken the protection of human rights.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bairbre de Brún, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, Liz Lynnes’s report highlights the need for a comprehensive, legislative framework which would prevent discrimination outside of the workplace and which would include a wide range of subjects.\nMillions of people are discriminated against – the elderly as well as other groups – everyday in the European Union as they try to access health, education and transport services or try to buy insurance or apply for a loan.\nThese same groups had difficulties as regards employment before the introduction of stronger legislation at the European level.
