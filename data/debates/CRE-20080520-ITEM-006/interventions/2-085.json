{"speaker": "Elizabeth Lynne,", "english": "Elizabeth Lynne, rapporteur . − Madam President, I should like to thank colleagues very much for their remarks. I am delighted that we appear to have the support of the majority of this House for a comprehensive directive. I hope the vote later today will prove that.\nI would also like to pay tribute again to Commissioner Špidla because I know it was his actual initiative to bring forward a comprehensive directive and call for the comprehensive directive within the work programme. I am only sorry that his view does not seem to be winning the argument with the rest of the Commission. And let us hope that, by passing the call for a comprehensive directive, we will give more power to him to actually argue the case.\nI did ask Commissioner Špidla for the impact assessments to be released. I know they have been done already. I am a little fearful since I have heard reports that there have been different impact assessments and those are being changed slightly as we speak to favour one view in the Commission rather than another. I would like some sort of clarification on that to see if the rumours that I have heard are true.\nI am very pleased that other Members have supported your call within the work programme for that comprehensive directive. Specific issues relating to all the areas – disability, age, religion or belief, and sexual orientation – can, I believe, be covered in one comprehensive directive. Education is not the way forward. We have tried that. For those Members who have been talking about education: it does not work.\nWe are talking as well about access to goods and services, not about employment. I know that all of the German delegations have problems with that because the employment directive has been gold-plated by the German Government. So leave that one aside. There are different Member States who have different problems: disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief. Some Member States cover some of them, others cover others and that is why it is important to get it right and have a comprehensive directive and not leave anyone behind.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Elizabeth Lynne, rapporteur . − Madam President, I should like to thank colleagues very much for their remarks.
