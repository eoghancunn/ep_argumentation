{"speaker": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). –", "english": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I wish to comment on two aspects of this excellent report by Elizabeth Lynne. I fully support the call to Member States and other relevant actors to collect, compile and publish comprehensive, accurate, comparable, reliable and separate statistics on discrimination and then to publish these statistics in a way that is easily understood by the public. In that way, I believe citizens can see for themselves the need for change. I fully support the call for a comprehensive, wide-ranging directive. This is an area where the EU can achieve strategic change when the legislation is implemented.\nFinally, with reference to the Lisbon Treaty, I was very pleased to hear the comments of the Slovenian presidency last week on the 2008 work programme with regard to their response for the ‘One Million Signatures for Disability’ campaign. This indicates that the presidency, and hopefully the Commission, are listening to the citizens and taking their concerns on board. This is a very hopeful sign for the Citizens’ Initiative as contained in the Lisbon Treaty, but again I wish to put on record my strong support for a comprehensive directive. There can be no hierarchy of discrimination.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Marian Harkin (ALDE). – Mr President, I wish to comment on two aspects of this excellent report by Elizabeth Lynne.
