{"speaker": "Richard Howitt (PSE). –", "english": "Richard Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, when I was this Parliament’s co-rapporteur for the Race Directive in 2000, the then Portuguese Presidency promised us there would be no hierarchy of discrimination and that further legislation would follow.\nOn 26 October 2004 President Barroso promised in this Parliament and during this Commission’s term of office a framework directive on – I quote – ‘all forms of discrimination’. That promise was repeated in their annual policy strategy for 2008. Now is the time to deliver.\nI would say that it is no excuse that Member States in some cases deliberately drag their feet on implementation of employment non-discrimination, but it is an excuse, and the Commission must not allow the slowest to dictate the speed of the rest.\nTwo weeks ago I met with Federal Minister Zypries in Germany and Minister Follett in Britain. They are willing to talk. Give them something to talk about!\nI am proud that we collected 1.3 million signatures for disability legislation. But as this Parliament’s president of the Disability Intergroup, I place on record my support for a horizontal directive. You will not divide and rule.\nFinally, it is no good for the Conservatives to say that they abhor discrimination on the grounds of religion, age or sexual orientation, but then to vote against legislation on these grounds, denying equal rights to Europeans, gay, young and old and to religious minorities. And Business Europe should be ashamed of saying in its submission to the Commission consultation dated 12 October 2007, I quote: ‘Business Europe believes there is no evidence of discrimination on any of the grounds covered by Article 13’. The Commission’s own Business Test Panel showed 89% of the 293 companies surveyed said they wanted EU legislation for equal protection. They want it; Parliament will vote for it; Europe needs it.\n(Applause from the centre and left)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Richard Howitt (PSE). – Mr President, when I was this Parliament’s co-rapporteur for the Race Directive in 2000, the then Portuguese Presidency promised us there would be no hierarchy of discrimination and that further legislation would follow.\nOn 26 October 2004 President Barroso promised in this Parliament and during this Commission’s term of office a framework directive on – I quote – ‘all forms of discrimination’.
