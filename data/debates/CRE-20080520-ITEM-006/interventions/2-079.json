{"speaker": "Neena Gill (PSE). –", "english": "Neena Gill (PSE). – Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Lynne on this directive because, in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which aims to promote mutual understanding and celebrate Europe’s diversity, I am shocked and dismayed at the levels of existing discrimination – not just in race but in disabilities, gender, sexual orientation and ageing. Discrimination is not just a problem in the labour market but also in housing, education, public and private services and even in religious matters.\nI am particularly concerned about the difference in levels of integration of minorities within various Member States as indicated by the Migrant Policy Index. This shows the failure of the implementation and enforcement of the minimum standards in anti-discrimination that we have sought to make EU-wide. I call upon the Commission to take up this matter, not just with the Member States, but also to take stronger action within the EU institutions.\nFinally, prior to the European elections, I would like to ask how this House is trying to set an example to the rest of Europe on anti-discrimination. Still only 30% of the MEPs are women and only 9 MEPs are non-white.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill (PSE). – Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Lynne on this directive because, in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which aims to promote mutual understanding and celebrate Europe’s diversity, I am shocked and dismayed at the levels of existing discrimination – not just in race but in disabilities, gender, sexual orientation and ageing.
