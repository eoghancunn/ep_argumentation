{"speaker": "Ján Figeľ,", "english": "Ján Figeľ, Member of the Commission . (SK) It is not only the discussion but also the report itself and the atmosphere surrounding qualifications in Europe that constitute a major challenge for us to establish a space with a more European content. This would mean rules and standards that establish a certain quality, and hence mobility, for citizens.\nI would therefore like to emphasise several aspects important to the entire issue. One is about creating a space, which means not only availability and quality of primary education, higher education and training but also a space for follow-up education, continual or lifelong learning, and for the recognition of unofficial and informal schooling. The European Qualifications Framework is moving in just that direction. Secondly, this is a follow-up contribution to what we have already done: the Europass adopted in this Parliament helps make qualifications more transparent, but the Qualifications Framework will be instrumental in making qualifications compatible and comparable, and will thus enable their transfer. This is a very important shift.\nIf we manage to adopt it definitively, it will provide a good framework not only for employers and employees but also for education and training providers, as it will open up this space and as a result will bring pressure to bear for improvements in quality. Openness is all about promoting better-quality education and training. Mrs Jensen has mentioned 32 countries. I believe that their number will gradually grow as we succeed in developing the Copenhagen Process and the Bologna Process, offering credibility, high standards and guaranteed qualitative parameters. I am convinced that this will benefit the EU as a whole, as well as its citizens and institutions. I believe that this will be instrumental in ensuring that a plumber, for example, whether Polish or from another country, is not perceived as a threat but as a very important contributor to mobility and competitiveness in a common Europe.
