    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Welcomes the Commission's initiative on modernising, continually improving and reinforcing European education and training systems and of opening consultations with a view to laying down a common reference framework for European certification systems;\n",
        "2.  Welcomes the fact that EQF is built on learning outcomes, reflects the complexity of lifelong learning and stimulates national and sectoral reform processes;\n",
        "3.  Considers that the EQF is a useful means of enhancing and consolidating mutual trust in the various systems and fully supports its objectives, namely the achievement at European level of transparency in relation to qualifications, mobility for members of the professions and lifelong learning;\n",
        "4.  Approves the establishment of a system based on common levels, instruments and principles which is both flexible and, at the same time, rooted in the principle of lifelong learning, but calls on the Commission to clarify the relationship between qualification levels, the Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications and the provisions for the validation of non-formal and informal learning which already exist or are currently being established at national and regional level;\n",
        "5.  Points out that one of the main tasks of the EQF must be to facilitate and promote the transfer of qualifications between different education and training systems, in order to make transnational professional mobility possible and better to meet the requirements of supply and demand in the European labour market; also points out that the EQF represents a suitable broader framework to provide an appropriate translation and communication instrument for establishing a common qualifications framework within Europe;\n",
        "6.  On this basis, notes that the Commission proposal is a right and necessary approach, even if it does not entirely meet the requirement of a transparent qualifications framework; calls for the eight proposed reference levels of the EQF to be revised and improved; takes the view that their descriptors should be expressed more concisely and comprehensibly and that it is important to distinguish clearly between the various reference levels, so that there can be a clear hierarchy of qualifications;\n",
        "7.  Stresses that the competences set out in the eight-level descriptors should include knowledge not only of social and ethical issues, but also of cultural issues;\n",
        "8.  Considers that the organisation and validation of lifelong learning are a matter for the Member States and cannot easily be brought within the purview of the EQF;\n",
        "9.  Considers that the three horizontal areas (‘knowledge’, ‘skills’ and ‘personal and professional competence’) should also be revised to make them clearer and more comprehensible;\n",
        "10. Stresses, also, that the different types of learning outcome, taken together, form part of an educational whole that cannot be quantified simply in terms of the level achieved in each individual area;\n",
        "11. Is critical of the third horizontal area ‘personal and professional competence’, as it is extremely difficult to judge ‘soft skills’ objectively and classify them methodically by descriptors and as comprehensively and 'personal competence' effectively constitutes the added value at the individual levels; calls on the Commission to improve the text accordingly;\n",
        "12. Points out that the EQF must serve primarily to classify certification procedures based on the outcome of vocational training and to that end, calls for simple, workable descriptors to be used and the number of levels reduced; notes that earlier comparative experiments have shown that the more fragmented the levels and the more numerous the criteria, the more difficult it is to bring them into a relationship;\n",
        "13. Takes the view that the EQF is not yet closely enough linked to the labour market and that if the EQF is to improve the competitiveness of the European economy as well as to help individuals develop their potential, with a view to the Lisbon Strategy, greater emphasis should be placed on improving the ability of the individual to find employment and achieving greater security for workers at the workplace ; underlines that each of the eight steps should emphasise abilities that can be gained via various educational pathways and take account of professional abilities and experience as well as their potential value in terms of professional advancement; therefore calls for the descriptors to be changed, not only taking into account and maintaining the Bologna precepts linked to academic education, but complementing them by also taking greater account of vocational training and further training systems;\n",
        "14. Urges a change to the present system of automatically matching reference levels 6, 7 and 8 to the three academic levels of the Bologna qualifications framework (bachelor, master and doctor), so that the individual's actual knowledge, abilities and personal and occupational skills gained are classified irrespective of the place they were acquired;\n",
        "15. Calls for the improvement of Table 2, which is intended further to explain the reference levels; considers that it should be clearly subordinated to the outcome-oriented approach, as it focuses on formal education; welcomes, therefore, the recommended cautious approach to Table 2; takes the view that the EQF as a general meta-framework should leave such questions of detail such as the design of Table 2 to actors at local or national level;\n",
        "16. Calls for stronger support and promotion of common European principles on providing and validating non-formal and informal learning processes on lifelong learning particularly regarding the acquisition of technological and scientific knowledge and skills and taking account of the particularities of the various professional disciplines and of the different regions and countries; takes the view that it is essential to pay particular attention to methods and systems of evaluating learning outcomes achieved by non-formal or informal methods, as the development of skills in the context of lifelong learning takes place in a wide range of everyday work situations;\n",
        "17. Maintains that the development of an EQF will lead to the introduction of common reference indicators, facilitating career planning by those in training and employment in the context of lifelong learning;\n",
        "18. Calls for every country to  have its own national or regional qualifications frameworks, organised in cooperation with the responsible organisations and bodies as appropriate, ensuring compatibility with the EQF; takes the view that in countries which do not yet have a national qualifications framework (NQF) and in which informal and non-formal qualifications are neglected, it makes sense for the EQF to be introduced;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to launch the process of harmonising conceptual approaches and terms;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission, to clarify the relationship between the framework of qualifications envisaged under the Bologna process and the EQF, and to specify whether the indicators proposed under the EQF will constitute the sole point of reference for a common European area of lifelong learning;\n",
        "21. Rejects the setting of prescriptive criteria for learning pathways or for the duration and location of education and training courses;\n",
        "22. Takes the view that further instruments to support the EQF should be fostered in order to facilitate public access to the EQF, with the main focus on the Copenhagen and Bologna conclusions, to which the EQF should form a logically structured starting point; takes the view that special attention should also be given to the contribution of international organisations and European centres such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in the field of learning and the acquisition of qualifications and skills; calls on the Commission to progress the development of the European Credit of Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) system to further develop and promote the Europass and to develop the ‘Ploteus’ data bank and to promote further innovative approaches to the recognition of informal and non-formal learning;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to enhance the role and structure of the National Europass Centre (NEC) and to make it easier for the NEC to fulfil its core tasks and to achieve the objectives laid down by the European Union, with particular reference to the wider dissemination of the instruments directly managed by the NEC (European Curriculum Vitae, Mobility Europass) and the progressive adoption of the Europass system;\n",
        "24. Underlines that the implementation of EQF on a voluntary basis requires the support and commitment of national and sectoral stakeholders;\n",
        "25. Recognises that EQF as a translation tool among different qualification systems requires consistency and mutual trust; recommends that principles of transparent and trustworthy quality assurance mechanisms be drawn up so that comparisons may be made allowing for the mutual recognition of thequalifications of EU citizens;\n",
        "26. Emphasises that the EQF can make a significant contribution to mobility in the European labour market if the decision of a Member State to match individual national qualifications to a particular EQF level is accepted by others; takes the view that, in the context of quality assurance, the Commission's proposal to oblige Member States to observe a number of common principles is an important element in the successful cooperation between stakeholders at various levels; notes, however, that this will only be the case if it does not duplicate existing quality assurances systems, such as the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance;\n",
        "27. Takes the view that mutual trust should be a result of increased cooperation between the Member States in the context of the EQF and also a precondition for the efficient functioning of the EQF an appropriate trial period, an impact assessment and a supporting evaluation are essential for the continual improvement and adaptation of the EQF; calls on the Commission to develop and propose appropriate methods and strategies to make this possible;\n",
        "28. Urges that EQF is further developed reflecting stakeholders' requests for clarification presented in the consultations process;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Commission to revise its proposal on the basis of Parliament's observations;\n",
        "30. Points to the importance of a wide and well-structured communication and dissemination strategy to raise awareness and interest in EQF's benefits;\n",
        "31. Takes the view that it is essential for the success of the EQF to provide something of practical use for end users, thus for citizens, employees and employers as well as for educational institutions;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission to brief Parliament on the outcome of the national consultations and to hold further exchanges of views before drawing up its final proposal;\n",
        "33. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
