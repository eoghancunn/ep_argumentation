{"speaker": "Olli Rehn,", "english": "Olli Rehn, Member of the Commission . Madam President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for this very substantive and responsible debate. I believe that your report, and I trust your vote tomorrow, will further reinforce European unity in order to bring the Kosovo status process to a successful conclusion.\nWith the submission of President Ahtisaari’s proposal to the UN Security Council, the process now enters its decisive phase. I trust that the Security Council will live up to its responsibility, and I hope that it will endorse the proposal in a timely manner.\nThen follows the hardest phase for us, that of the implementation of the status, which, as has been said today in this House, is a real litmus test for the EU’s common foreign and security policy. Therefore, I highly appreciate the support for this joint challenge of ours provided by Parliament and by the rapporteur on Kosovo, Mr Lagendijk.\nIn conclusion, I am glad that all three institutions share the view that European unity and EU leadership continue to be needed to achieve a sustainable settlement that produces a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and assures continued regional stability. At the same time, we are providing Serbia with a tangible EU perspective, which should help Serbia to leave the nationalist past behind and turn towards a European future.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Olli Rehn, Member of the Commission .
