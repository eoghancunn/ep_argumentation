    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Supports the UN-led process to determine the final status of Kosovo and the efforts to establish a viable framework that guarantees stability and protection for all the communities in Kosovo and long-term, self-sustaining economic and social development; endorses Mr Mr Ahtisaari's Comprehensive Proposal for a Kosovo Status Settlement and, on this basis, expects the UN Security Council to adopt swiftly a new resolution replacing Resolution 1244;\n",
        "2.   Takes the view that the only sustainable settlement for Kosovo is one which:\n",
        "3.  Considers that any settlement regarding the future status of Kosovo must be in accordance with international law;\n",
        "4.  Expresses the hope that a strong and clearly pro-European government can be formed soon in Serbia, which will be seriously and positively engaged in seeking a solution to the question of the status of Kosovo; emphasises that such a government is also necessary for the purposes of full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and will allow, under these conditions, for the re-opening of the negotiations on, and the final conclusion of, a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the European Union;\n",
        "5.   Believes that the final settlement should cover inter alia the following aspects:\n",
        "6.  Underlines that the solution in Kosovo will set no precedent in international law, as Kosovo has been under UN rule since 1999 and Security Council Resolution 1244 already contained provisions on the need to resolve the question of Kosovo's final status; concludes, therefore, that the situation regarding Kosovo is in no way comparable with the situation in other conflict regions which are not under UN administration;\n",
        "7.  Emphasises that an agreement on the future of Kosovo must also include specific institutional arrangements for Mitrovica which fully guarantee the rights and security of the Serb community without undermining the unity of Kosovo; believes that those arrangements should be directly supervised by the international community, in consultation with Belgrade; reminds Serbia, however, that such involvement in Kosovo is linked with Serbia's cooperation in implementing the final status settlement;\n",
        "8.  Welcomes, therefore, the fact that the Ahtisaari proposal outlines wide-ranging autonomy for the Serbian and other communities, including a substantial degree of municipal autonomy in line with the European principles of subsidiarity and self-governance;\n",
        "9.  Is of the opinion that the international community should, as far as possible, gear its presence towards assisting local authorities in:\n",
        "10. Believes, therefore, that, whilst it should be staffed in a manner commensurate with its tasks, the international presence in Kosovo should not result in the establishment of a parallel administration or replicate the existing UN-led administration;\n",
        "11. Emphasises that the international community must have direct corrective and, in limited cases, substitution powers in crucial areas such as:\n",
        "12. Stresses that additional efforts are needed to support the further return of refugees and displaced persons throughout Kosovo; underlines that the key to sustainable return is work opportunities and that sustainable economic development must now become a priority; underlines that non-Serb and non-Albanian refugees, such as Roma and Ashkali, need special attention, including the Roma internall displaced persons living in the camps in Kosovska Mitrovica;\n",
        "13. Supports the need for an inclusive and fair educational system which will provide for Roma and Ashkali pupils to be partially educated in the Roma language, thereby nurturing the identity and culture of those minority communities;\n",
        "14. Emphasises that a final decision on the future status of Kosovo can only be taken by the United Nations Security Council; urges the European Union and its Member States, and in particular those Member States which are also members of the UN Security Council, to give their full and active support to a viable solution for the future status of Kosovo;\n",
        "15. Considers that the adoption of a new UN Security Council resolution is also crucial for the future engagement of the EU in Kosovo, and that no enhanced EU involvement should be envisaged in the absence of such a resolution;\n",
        "16. Is convinced that, in the light of its central role in the implementation of the settlement, the European Union should have a decisive say on the final terms of the settlement;\n",
        "17. Believes that Member States should try to reach a single position on the question of Kosovo and therefore calls on the Council of Ministers to endeavour to adopt a common position on the status issue spelling out the minimum requirements of a sustainable, EU-compatible solution for Kosovo;\n",
        "18. Recalls that, in accordance with Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union, Member States represented in the UN Security Council would be expected to uphold that common position and to keep the EU Council of Ministers regularly informed about negotiations; also calls for the European Parliament to be kept regularly informed;\n",
        "19. Calls on those EU Member States that are members of the Contact Group to share their information with the EU Council of Ministers and all other Member States, and to improve coordination and cooperation with them, because the EU as a whole will bear the international responsibility and the financial burden of the final settlement;\n",
        "20. Urges Member States in the UN Security Council and, in particular, the Permanent Members to play a constructive role, to strive to ensure that the two parties involved act in a flexible manner and to adopt an unambiguous, sustainable solution for Kosovo, along the lines of the proposals submitted by the Special Envoy, with the agreement of the two parties as far as possible;\n",
        "21. Is prepared to make available the additional resources required in order to finance the future EU involvement in Kosovo with a view to implementing the status settlement and supporting Kosovo's EU prospects, provided that:\n",
        "22. Recalls the commitment, given by the Finnish Presidency on behalf of the Council in connection with the adoption of the budget for 2007, to provide Parliament with detailed information on the scope, objectives and likely financial implications of the possible forthcoming operation as the planning of the mission proceeds;\n",
        "23. Is concerned about the way in which the transition from the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to the new International Civilian Office will be managed; reminds UNMIK that it should remain engaged in Kosovo until the new Office is organised and fully operational; invites the United Nations and the EU to devise means to prevent further loss of international expertise in crucial areas of administration, particularly in view of the fact that Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government will need time and assistance to take over certain legislative and executive powers from UNMIK;\n",
        "24. Urges the OSCE to continue to play a major role in Kosovo after the status settlement with regard, in particular, to the monitoring and verification of election processes; calls in this regard on both the Council and the OSCE to enhance their cooperation in the field of the rule of law, with a clear division of tasks as regards the ESDP mission;\n",
        "25. Expresses its support for the EU's emphasis on the judiciary and the rule of law in the post-settlement phase, underlining that a smooth transfer of responsibilities will be needed; calls for the establishment for a clear and transparent division of tasks and responsibilities between domestic Kosovo courts and judicial authorities and the planned EU law and order mission; demands full accountability and respect for the rule of law in relation to detentions and other actions by KFOR;\n",
        "26. Points out to the Kosovo authorities that the international community expects them\n",
        "27. Underlines in this context that the international presence will remain in Kosovo until the above objectives are truly embedded and realised;\n",
        "28. Is deeply concerned about the recent violent demonstrations in Kosovo, which are seriously endangering the smooth continuation of the process of finding a peaceful solution for the future status of Kosovo; calls on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to make a peaceful conclusion of the status process possible;\n",
        "29. Further reminds the Kosovo authorities that, once the status issue is finally resolved, the people of Kosovo will want their government to address the problems which affect their daily lives, such as those relating to security, economic development, corruption and organised crime, employment, adequate public services and equality for all before the law;\n",
        "30. Invites the EU and Kosovo's authorities to work together so as to create conditions for improved economic growth for the benefit of all ethnic communities in Kosovo; reiterates the need for the establishment of a comprehensive and realistic long-term economic development plan as well as for full compliance with the fundamental principles of the rule of law, and a detailed and properly resourced anti-corruption strategy;\n",
        "31. Emphasises the need to give more support to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the basis of the European Charter for Small Enterprises, which has been endorsed by Kosovo; calls on the Commission to ensure access to EU Structural Funds, provide better financing for SME-related projects and set up an institutional framework to enhance cooperation between the Community and the private sector in Kosovo;\n",
        "32. Urges the leaders of the Serb community in Kosovo to recognise that their interests are better served in a democratic, decentralised and economically viable Kosovo, and to engage in the post-settlement process in order to ensure that those provisions of the agreement which are of direct interest for them are fully implemented;\n",
        "33. Calls on the Serbian Government to recognise that the future lies in the development of close, transparent ties with Kosovo, in the context of deepened regional integration and of the shared prospect of future EU membership;\n",
        "34. Stresses that finding a solution to the issue of the future status of Kosovo on the basis of Mr Ahtisaari's final proposals is of the greatest importance for the stability and the further development of the entire region; calls in this context on the governments of all neighbouring states to contribute positively to this process and to respect the existing state borders; furthermore, supports the view that, in the long run, the solution regarding the future status of Kosovo lies also in the fact that both Serbia and Kosovo are due to become part of the EU, together with their neighbours, since the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union;\n",
        "35. Reiterates that anchoring Kosovo firmly within the Stabilisation and Association Process will, inter alia, strengthen Kosovo's economic relations with Member States and their neighbours in the Western Balkans and facilitate the stabilisation process in the region;\n",
        "36. Welcomes the signature of the free-trade agreements with Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia; urges Kosovo's authorities to fully implement those agreements and ensure that free trade with Serbia and Montenegro continues;\n",
        "37. Calls on the Kosovar and Serbian authorities to fully cooperate with each other and with the ICTY in order to deliver up alleged war criminals;\n",
        "38. Believes that the publication of Mr Ahtisaari’s report should be accompanied by an outreach campaign aimed at explaining clearly and objectively to the peoples concerned, including Serb citizens, the terms of the proposed settlement, and that a message of peaceful co-existence must be stressed by the European Union in relation to Kosovo; considers that a Kosovo that recognises the rights of the majority and the minority will be stable and prosperous;\n",
        "39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, to the Government of Serbia and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, to UNMIK, to the Members of the Contact Group, to the United Nations Security Council and to the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo.\n"
