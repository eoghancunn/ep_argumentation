        "1.  Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the removal of existingbarriers and obstacles, including architectural barriers, with a view to creating equal rights and opportunities for women and girls with disabilities to play a part in family, political, cultural, social and professional life, particularly through better implementation of Community anti-discrimination and gender-equality legislation and better use of the opportunities provided by relevant Community programmes and the ESF;\n",
        "2.  Calls on Member States to take full account of the needs of persons with disabilities and the special needs of women in all national, regional and local policies, particularly those covering town planning, education, employment, housing, transport, health and social services;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt and implement the necessary measures to support women with disabilities so that they may  progress in those areas of social life and the world of work, culture and politics in which they are still underrepresented;\n",

        "5.  Calls on the Commission and the Member States to put in place effective  legislation and policies focusing on women and children,  which will ensure that instances of exploitation, violence and sexual abuse against persons with disabilities - within their places of residence and elsewhere -  are identified and investigated and, where appropriate, lead to prosecution; suggests that, in that context, particular attention be paid  to  women withdisabilities whose disability prevents them from representing themselves;\n",
        "6.  Is shocked at the fact that women with disabilities are three times as likely to be the victims of violence as women without disabilities, and calls therefore for the Daphne Programme also to be used to combat this type of violence;\n",
        "7.  Emphasises the importance of actively combating segregation of people with disabilitiesfrom childhood onwards;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission and Member States to promote pilot schemes and tried and tested procedures for integrative establishments from kindergarten, school and training to professional life;\n",

        "10. Calls on Member States to address the lack of adequate health care for women with disabilities by providing specialist medical staff and appropriate infrastructures;\n",
        "11. Calls on the Commission, in conjunction with the competent national authorities, to investigate the particular health and medical care problems suffered by women with disabilities, focusing on care and information;\n",
        "12. Considers there to be a relationship between havingadisability and the lowerlevel of educational achievement which subsequently affects employment rates amongst disabled people;\n",
        "13. Expresses its concern at the fact that women with disabilities have lower levels of educational achievement, which makes it more difficult for them to gain access to, stay in and be promoted in the labour market; considers that people with disabilities must be given the same opportunities to study and must have the right of access to the labour market so that they can support themselves; considers that women and girls with disabilities should be encouraged to seek education and employment on the basis of their resources and interests rather than of what they are lacking;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to foster implementation of the principle of universal accessibility in society, goods and services, so that women with disabilities may enjoy as much autonomy as possible;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, since in many situations ITC facilities are a fundamental instrument for the integration of persons with a disability, to draw up appropriate measures to eliminate the digital gap caused by gender, so that women with disabilities may have access to ITC facilities and benefit from them under equal conditions with men;\n",
        "16. Believes that, with a view to improving access to the labour market for persons with disabilities and enabling them to become more active and develop their abilities, use should be made of all possible incentive measures, including tax breaks, to encourage employers to take on persons with disabilities and tailor working hours to the needs of parents bringing up children with disabilities;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission and Member States, in their efforts to increase employment of women with disabilities, to prevent discrimination by employers in connection with the appointment of women with disabilities;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission and Member States to incorporate the concept of 'flexibility' into matters relating to disability in recognition of the fact that each disabled person has different needs, in order that, in a community of citizens based on diversity, assistance can be tailored to each individual situation;\n",
        "19. Considers that the measures created should be geared towards greater integration;\n",
        "20. Points out that it is women who, in most cases, care for people with disabilities, and hence considers it necessary to develop measures to raise social awareness in order to ensure that men too are involved in this task;\n",
        "21. Calls upon the Commission and the Member States to seek to make responsibility for the care and participation of people with disabilities the responsibility of society as a whole rather than that only of the families of persons with disabilities and to take into account, when devising policies, the particular dedication of women who are responsible for persons with disabilities and the situation of those persons – often relatives – who take responsibility for persons with disabilities; considers it important to highlight the fact that this work is mainly done by women and that women are therefore particularly affected by cuts in public care services, both as paid carers and as relatives;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to draw up the necessary measures to assist the work of families and organisations that support both people with disabilities and their families;\n",
        "23. Considers that various support measures must be proposed so that both people with disabilities and their families can live normal lives on the same terms as people without disabilities and their families, as well as support measures for those - often relatives - who take economic and social responsibility for people with disabilities, who in many cases require total dedication, which isolates them and necessitates support at many levels; notes that, as things currently stand, women bear a large share of such responsibilities, both paid and unpaid; considers it self-evident that this is not a task primarily for one sex or the other and that the view that this is a responsibility for women should be actively combated;\n",
        "24. Proposes that Member States should harmonise municipal regulations governing parking for the disabled and consider whether to reduce transport fares for those who accompany disabled persons;\n",

        "26. Stresses the need to raise the profile and improve the image of women with disabilities in the media, which will make the broad public more aware of their daily lives and give them greater opportunities to express themselves and take part in social and political life;\n",
        "27. Stresses how important it is for Member States to recognise the self-evident right of women with disabilities to their own sexuality and their right to start a family;\n",

        "29. Calls on the Commission and Member States to give children, young people and adults with disabilities the preconditions for independence and self-determination and, in so doing, to devote special attention to equality issues;\n",
        "30. Recognises that even in relation to existing independent-living services and health services disabled women experience discrimination in access;\n",
        "31. Highlights the role played by the educationof children of both sexes in the building ofthesociety of the future, and stresses that efforts must be made in order to gear it towardsensuring that disability is not an obstacle to their playinga part in society on the basis of the same rights and opportunities, with a view to fostering a framework for cooperation, integration and disability awareness-raising at school, the latter being an indispensable tool for making this a reality;\n",
        "32. Stresses the important role of non-governmental organisations working with disabled women and calls on the Commission and the Member States to support them;\n",
        "33. Stresses the need for recent data broken down by genderto be gathered on the subject of disability and for research to be carried out using gender equality indicators in order to discover the real situation of women and girls with disabilities;\n",
        "34. Stresses the need to ensure care for the reproductive health of women with disabilities, paying attention to aspects such as family planning, health services and information about motherhood, so that they may be able to establish relationships that are equitable, responsible and satisfying;\n",
        "35. Takes the view that EU policy should give employers' organisations, trade unions and non-governmental organisations greater encouragement to devise more effective means of assisting persons with disabilities;\n",
        "36. Calls on the Commission to facilitate the creation of a network for disabled women across the European Union and in candidate countries, allowing for the exchange of best practices, capacity-building and empowerment;\n",
        "37. Highlights the need for women with disabilities to enjoy free access to the new audiovisual media;\n",
        "38. Reminds the Commission that thorough knowledge of this matter and of the 'social model of disability' which focuses on society’s barriers, as opposed to the 'medical model of disability' which deals only with the medical aspects of disability, is the proper basis for providing solutions, services and support, for devising policies, for assigning resources and for measuring the impact of policies on the situation of persons with disabilities;\n",
        "39. Reminds the Member States that their collaboration in advancing and improving the situation of women and girls suffering from any kind of disability is of fundamental importance;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Member States to promote citizens’ initiatives aimed at supporting those with disabilities;\n",

        "43. Calls on the Member States to report to the Commission and Parliament on the situation of women and girls with disabilities on the basis of their country reports and on the measures which they have taken to comply with the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women;\n",
        "44. Considers that disabilities should be regarded as a natural phenomenon, which is part of everyday life, and not as a deviant appendage to it; notes that there will always be citizens with disabilities and that it is therefore self-evident that disabilities are an integral part of society;\n",
        "45. Ought itself to promote greater development and exploitation of technology and facilities to eliminate disabling environments; considers that development work should be based on the fact that men and women sometimes have different needs;\n",
        "46. Calls on the Commission and Member States to promote equality of living conditions for girls and boys, women and men with disabilities;\n",
        "47. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, theCommission, the Council of Europe and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n"
