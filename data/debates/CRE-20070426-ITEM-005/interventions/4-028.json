{"speaker": "Joaquín Almunia,", "english": "Joaquín Almunia, Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is concerned about disabled women, who are victims of double discrimination: on the grounds of gender and on the grounds of disability.\nThe different forms of discrimination suffered by disabled women and young people prevents them from living independently, since these barriers often deny them access to education and to the labour market.\nIt is entirely unacceptable that around 80% of disabled women are victims of violence. The risk of suffering sexual abuse is four times higher for disabled women than for women who are not disabled. The European Union must protect the rights of these people and allow them effective access to all forms of protection.\nI would like to thank Mr Herranz, who has had the initiative to draw up this report with a view to increasing public awareness of the dramatic situation I have just referred to.\nIn the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, it is entirely appropriate that this Parliament should be adopting a resolution on the situation of disabled women in the European Union. The draft resolution is absolutely right to mention the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by the European Commission on behalf of the European Community on the same day that it became available for signing, 30 March last. At least 22 Member States have added their signatures. Furthermore, I would like to point out that the Commission inspired the specific provisions of that Convention on respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of disabled women.\nParliament's adoption of this resolution is also fully in line with the European strategy in the field of disability, a strategy that contributes to the implementation of the measures mentioned in the report. The Commission is therefore already working on the application of the provisions of the directive combating the discrimination suffered, in particular, by disabled people who want access to employment and professional training. Furthermore, the new regulation on the Structural Funds introduces the use of accessibility for disabled people as a criterion for the selection of projects.\nI also take note of the appeal to the Commission that it draw up legislation to guarantee the autonomy of disabled men and women. In this regard, the Commission intends to launch an impact study to look into the possibility of proposing new legislation in this regard, on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, which makes it possible to extend the scope of the current directives.\nFinally, the Commission will shortly begin a study on the current situation of disabled women, taking account of the provisions of the United Nations Convention. This study will provide us with a basis for defining specific actions, and will also make it possible for the Commission to gather data and information.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joaquín Almunia, Member of the Commission.
