{"speaker": "Claude Turmes,", "english": "Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Madam President, the Hall report is ringing the alarm bells. We are in the middle of Sustainable Energy Week and, however positive this event is, it should not divert attention from the fact that what governments, in particular, have achieved over the last two or three years on energy efficiency is extremely disappointing. Not implementing legislation, sending energy efficiency action plans which are not action plans but just a compilation of some sort – that is ridiculous!\nI call on the pride of prime ministers. Come on, prime ministers! You come to Brussels in March one year after the historic summit where you prime ministers have given a lot of speeches about the priority of priorities being energy efficiency, and then you come one year later and you have achieved almost nothing as governments!\nI think we should all join forces to urge governments forward. The Commission must also approve and take new initiatives on building on CHP and on labelling electricity savings.\nFinally, on my good friend Schatzi:\n(DE) The only one being dopey around here is you, because there were Christmas markets long before patio heaters were invented, and I believe Parliament is perfectly within its rights at least to ask how inconsistent we are being on climate change. It is not a matter of interfering with people’s lifestyles; it is a matter of applying pressure to a wound, which is what this House must do if we intend to heal it.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Claude Turmes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – Madam President, the Hall report is ringing the alarm bells.
