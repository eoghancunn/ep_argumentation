        "3.  Notes that in the review of EIB strategy carried out in 2005, encouraging economic and social cohesion within the European Union continued to be the EIB’s main aim; therefore calls for the EIB’s activity in this field to focus on the least developed regions;\n",
        "4.  (Urges the EIB, with reference to the Innovation 2010 initiative, to fund projects that are directly relevant to innovation; with regard to education and training; calls for the policy goal of the European Union tobecome a knowledge-based society to be fully supported, with a particular emphasis on innovation-related education projects, both in higher and basic education in order to improve Europe's human potential; supports the EIB in its efforts to bring less developed areas into the knowledge-based economy;\n",
        "5.  Congratulates the EIB on having achieved its aim of devoting between 30 and 35 % of its individual loans within the EU to projects intended to protect or improve the natural or urban environment; notes that out of the total loans made within the European Union, 60 % were granted in relation to the urban environment (public transport and urban renewal), while only 20 % were intended for research into energy efficiency and the development of renewable forms of energy; urges the EIB, therefore, to distribute funds for environmental protection more coherently;\n",
        "6.  Welcomes the EIB’s intention to draw up a new energy action plan incorporating the new EU energy objectives; calls on the EIB to adopt more ambitious financing objectives both for renewable energies and for programmes to improve energy efficiency, above all in the new Member States and in the SME sector, where there is more scope for improvement;\n",
        "7.  Congratulates the EIB on its role as a financial catalyst, above all in relation to loans in support of public-private partnerships promoting private sector participation in financing the Trans-European Networks; calls for an EU guarantee instrument to be developed specifically for TEN-T projects in order to cover the risk that revenue might fall short of the expected levels in the initial operating phase; stresses the importance of improving the dimension of energy networks to and among Member States to facilitate the creation of the internal market for energy supply and distribution;\n",
        "8.  Considers that EIB activities should reflect the needs of an enlarged EU; points out  that the EIB does not have a permanent delegation in the Baltic Sea region, which would cover the Baltic States, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and EEA-EFTA countries;\n",
        "9.  Calls for greater consistency in the EIB’s external mandate both with regard to the sufficiency of funds for the whole period of the new mandate and their distribution by geographical areas; points out that the loans granted to Latin America are insufficient, representing only 2,5 % of the total devoted to projects outside the European Union; welcomes the new initiative combining EIB loans with EU grant aid for regional infrastructure projects in Africa as well as other initiatives that support an African development agenda that must be developed on the basis of sustainability criteria, in environmental, social and economic terms; urges the EIB, in conjunction with global loans for Mediterranean partner countries, to implement technical assistance in order to help develop and reform the local financial sector;\n",

        "11. Welcomes the closer cooperation with the Commission in the new programmes which aim to increase the efficiency of expenditure thanks to the experience acquired by the EIB, in particular the JASPERS programme;\n",
        "12. Points out that a range of new financial instruments managed by the EIB and the European Investment Fund (EIF)will have a multiplier effect on non-reimbursable aid, and is delighted that the JEREMIE initiative has come into operation, since it could produce a multiplier effect of up to ten times the size of the Structural Fund budget through the operation of the EIF serving to turn subsidies into a range of financial products aimed at SMEs;\n",
        "13. Considers that the new cooperation and financing arrangements must be evaluated carefully with a view to correcting any administrative obstacles that may be involved;\n",
        "14. Points out to the EIB that its loans must not be a substitute, under more advantageous conditions for the intermediary financial institutions, for loans which in any case would have been granted by the private sector;\n",
        "15. Calls on the Court of Auditors to ensure that the conditions governing the loans and guarantees involving EU budget resources granted by the EIB  do not serve to enable certain privileged parties to benefit indirectly from unwarranted assistance when they could obtain financing on the market; 16.  Calls on the EIB to conduct a detailed study on the real contribution of  the EIB investment to regional development, once also analysed the effects of EU policies and to introduce appropriate indicators, as recommended by its own evaluation department;\n",
        "17. Recommends that the EIB further increase the possibilities of access to its finance, above all for SMEs, by increasing the number of financial institutions with the appropriate expertise and lending capacities to support EU priorities,acting as intermediaries in each country, which at the same time would improve the conditions for the end recipients;\n",
        "18. Calls on the EIB to explain more clearly its evaluation criteria when selecting projects for funding and to submit an evaluation of its operations in terms of economic growth and employment; recommends that the EIB publish its information on the investment projects in which it is involved, to encourage private investors to participate in the possible financing of those projects;\n",
        "19. Recommends that the EIB lay down more clear-cut criteria to govern the ultimate allocation of its global loans; and calls on the EIB to establish a transparent procedure for determining and assessing how the loans have been used by intermediary banks, in particular with a view to ascertaining whether the quality of EIB loans really benefits the end recipients;\n",
