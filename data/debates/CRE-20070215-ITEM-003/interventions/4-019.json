{"speaker": "Ieke van den Burg (PSE). –", "english": "Ieke van den Burg (PSE). – Mr President, one minute is not a long time and I shall use it mainly to express my congratulations, firstly, to the rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero, whose report we support completely. I hope that he also understands that the three additional amendments we have tabled are additions to and not criticisms of his report, in particular Amendment 2, which deals with the current problem of combining funds that are considered under the state aid rules and funding from the EIB. This is a problem that I think is worthwhile tackling. Therefore, I hope these amendments will be adopted.\nThe remainder of my minute I shall use to congratulate Mr Maystadt, not only on his good work at the bank, but also on the increase in funds he has recently secured. I really hope that the risk assessments and the controls based on the advanced Basel II rules can be properly executed. I think we shall come back to this issue in a future report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Ieke van den Burg (PSE). – Mr President, one minute is not a long time and I shall use it mainly to express my congratulations, firstly, to the rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero, whose report we support completely.
