{"speaker": "Joaquín Almunia,", "english": "Joaquín Almunia, Member of the Commission. (ES) The Commission is pleased with the fruitful dialogue that has taken place over recent years between the EIB and Parliament, which is reflected in this report by Mr Montoro that we are debating today, and to which the policy of transparency implemented by the Bank and its President, Mr Maystadt, has made a positive contribution.\nWith the enlargement of the European Union involving 10 countries in 2004 and completed on 1 January of this year with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, with the greater interdependence of economies and within a context, in 2005, of budgetary fragility in most of the Member States, the European Investment Bank represented, in the year covered by this report, and still represents today, a fundamental instrument for responding to the ever-increasing funding demands to be met by the European Union’s policies.\nThis is demonstrated by the new instruments implemented within the Union’s budgetary framework for 2007-2013, or the extension of the Bank’s external mandate approved by the Ecofin Council a few months ago. Notable amongst those instruments are the risk-sharing finance facility, which will enhance private sector investments in research and development through greater access to the Bank's funding, the guarantee instrument for the trans-European transport networks, or the contributions to the cohesion policy by means of the JASPER programme, in cooperation with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, and the JESSICA programme, in cooperation with the Council of Europe Development Bank.\nFurthermore, the European Investment Fund, integrated into the EIB group, will increase its contribution to the Union’s objectives thanks to its involvement in the new European competitiveness and innovation programme, and also thanks to the increased opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses to access funding within the context of the JEREMIE programme, in conjunction with the Structural Funds.\nIn the external field, the main feature of the European Investment Bank’s new external mandate is that it is being brought more into line with the Union’s external action priorities. In this regard, the Bank’s resources for action in the Mediterranean, by means of the FEMIP and in the neighbouring countries, by means of the new investment fund, and the tripartite agreement for action between the Commission, the EIB and the EBRD, have been strengthened.\nThe EIB will also have greater resources for acting in areas such as Latin America and Africa. All of these developments are taken up in Mr Montoro’s report and the Commission sees them as extremely important and positive. They are all evidence of the central role played by the European Investment Bank in achieving the Union’s objectives and the constructive spirit of dialogue prevailing between Parliament and the Bank is therefore very good news.\nI can only add for my part, as Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Investment Bank, the Bank headed by Mr Maystadt, that cooperation has been excellent, and I hope it will continue to be so. I am sure that it will. And I am sure that this cooperation between Parliament and the Bank, between the Commission and the Bank, will make it easier for us to achieve our common objectives — those of the Commission and Parliament — for the future of the European Union.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Joaquín Almunia, Member of the Commission.
