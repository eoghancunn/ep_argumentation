    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Approves the annual report for 2006 submitted by the European Ombudsman, and approves the form in which it is presented, combining a summary of the year’s activities and a thematic analysis of the Ombudsman’s decisions and the problems raised at various stages of the procedure; calls on the Ombudsman, however, to introduce technical changes to make it easier to read the various chapters, such as tables for the statistics and summaries for the analytical section;\n",
        "2.   Calls for all European institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions;\n",
        "3.   Considers that the Ombudsman has continued to exercise his powers in a balanced and energetic way both with regard to examining and handling complaints, and conducting and concluding enquiries, and with regard to maintaining constructive relations with the European Union's institutions and bodies and encouraging citizens to avail themselves of their rights in relation to those institutions and bodies;\n",
        "4.   Encourages the European Ombudsman to pursue his efforts and to promote his activities effectively and flexibly so that in the eyes of citizens he represents the custodian of sound administration in the Community institutions;\n",
        "5.   Stresses that a key purpose of any intervention by the Ombudsman is to seek a friendly settlement between the complainant and the institution and prevent a dispute before the courts;\n",
        "6.   Agrees that the term 'maladministration by the Community' should be broadly interpreted so as to include not only unlawful administrative acts or infringements of binding legal rules or principles, but also, for example, cases where the administrative authorities have been slothful, negligent or lacking in transparency or have infringed other principles of good administration;\n",
        "7.   Encourages the Ombudsman to continue to promote a genuine culture of service as an integral component of good administrative practice in order to ensure that the European Union's public administration is geared towards openness and dialogue with members of the public using their services, recognising and apologising for mistakes and seeking satisfactory solutions for complainants;\n",
        "8.   Considers that it is not enough that some of the other institutions and Community bodies, primarily the Commission and the Council, have adopted separate codes of good administrative conduct: in the case of the Commission, the code of 13 September 2000 covering its staff's relations with the public, and in the case of the Council, the code of 25 June 2001 on its staff's professional relations with the public;\n",
        "9.   Notes that the 'European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour' proposed by the European Ombudsman, and approved by the European Parliament on 6 September 2001, covers the staff of all Community institutions and bodies and, unlike the other codes, has been regularly updated and published on the Ombudsman's website;\n",
        "10. Stresses that the code'serga omneseffectiveness was explained by the Ombudsman in his letter of 11 March 2002 to the President of Parliament, which is published on the Ombudsman's website; considers, therefore, that no other code with more limited application may replace, or derogate from, the 'European' code of conduct;\n",
        "11. Urges all the institutions to cooperate constructively with the Ombudsman at all stages of the procedure, to abide by friendly solutions, to follow up his critical remarks and to apply his draft recommendations;\n",
        "12. Encourages the Ombudsman to draw up a list every year of best administrative practices and a list of practices which are not consonant with his decisions, and to present a study of the outcome of his critical comments;\n",
        "13. Urges all those who are the subject of critical remarks to respect and take account of those remarks in their future actions, so as to avoid any instances of inconsistency between official pronouncements and administrative actions or failures to act; 14  Reminds all Community institutions and bodies of their obligations under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[3], which must be effectively applied, not least to ensure the credibility of the proposed revision thereof which is currently under consideration, and their obligations under Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[4];\n",
        "15. Calls on the Commission once again to make proper use of its discretionary powers to initiate infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty or to propose penalties under Article 228 of the EC Treaty, while taking scrupulous care to avoid delays or unjustifiable failure to take prompt action, which are incompatible with the Commission's powers to oversee the application of Community law;\n",
        "16. Considers that, if an institution refuses to follow a recommendation in a special report by the Ombudsman even though Parliament has approved that recommendation, Parliament could legitimately use its powers to bring an action before the Court of Justice in respect of the act or omission which was the subject of the Ombudsman's recommendation;\n",
        "17. Urges all Community institutions and bodies, and the Member States' permanent representations, to cooperate in the interests of transparency and compliance with the rules of good administration embodied in this report, without shifting their responsibilities to powerful central bodies such as the Presidency of the Council or the Board of Governors of the European Schools, over which it would be difficult for the Ombudsman to exert control;\n",
        "18. Calls on the European Personnel Selection Office to ensure it complies effectively and fully with the rules and established practice as regards the openness and transparency of competition procedures, particularly with regard to candidates' access to information relating to them about the marking of papers, to put an end to linguistic discrimination and to refrain from evading its own responsibilities by reference to decisions made by selection boards;\n",
        "19. Warmly welcomes the declaration of the European Ombudsman of his intention to deal with the lending activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB) outside the EU using his powers of own inquiry, and notes that the Ombudsman will need to evaluate and ensure the internal capacity to deal with complaints in that regard;\n",
        "20. Invites the Ombudsman to consider concluding a Memorandum of Understanding with the EIB on the modalities of the cooperation between the institutions as regards the exercise of the Ombudsman's powers to investigate complaints concerning instances of maladministration in the activities of the EIB, and takes the view that the EIB would be best placed to actively inform citizens affected by projects financed by the Bank of the possibility of complaining to the Ombudsman, including when these are third-country nationals resident outside the EU;\n",
        "21. Welcomes the fact that the Ombudsman  can conduct inquiries into the behaviour of bodies operating under the EU's third pillar;\n",
        "22. Notes that the Ombudsman has presented two special reports, one of which has already achieved its intended purpose and the other of which will be examined by Parliament; supports the conclusions addressed by the Ombudsman to the Council concerning the need to apply consistent rules on the language regimes used by the Council Presidencies and on the need to clarify the status of the Presidency as part of the Council as an institution;\n",
        "23. Would welcome a tightening-up of internal parliamentary procedures in order to guarantee, in future, swifter processing of the Ombudsman's annual report by Parliament's Committee on Petitions;\n",
        "24. Urges the Ombudsman to submit to Parliament any requests he deems appropriate to improve the exchange of information between their respective departments and strengthen cooperation, in the framework laid down by Article 1 of the Framework  Agreement on cooperation of 15 March 2006, with particular reference to communications, information technology and translation, and regrets the failure to consult the Committee on Petitions;\n",
        "25. Is pleased that constructive relations have been maintained with Parliament's Committee on Petitions, both with regard to the Ombudsman's participation in meetings of the Committee and with regard to reciprocal respect of competences and prerogatives; invites the Ombudsman, therefore, to forward to the Committee on Petitions his position in relation to the most important inquiries initiated by him in good time so as to achieve useful synergies;\n",
        "26. Confirms its favourable opinion, as expressed in 2001, of the Ombudsman's request for the Statute of the Ombudsman to be amended with regard to access to documents and the hearing of witnesses, endorsing the principle that the changes subsequently requested will serve to clarify the Ombudsman's powers in view of the increasing demands placed upon him in the exercise of his office and the fact that, in practice, the main European institutions have already accepted the majority of them;\n",
        "27. Stresses that these changes should not affect the basis and nature of the Ombudsman's role as guardian of citizens' interests in relation to the European Union's public administration;\n",
        "28. Recognises the useful contribution of the European Network of Ombudsmen, in line with the subsidiarity principle, in securing extra-judicial remedies;\n",
        "29. Encourages mutual consultation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, in connection with the European Network of Ombudsmen, to resolve issues which have already been dealt with as the subject of petitions;\n",
        "30. Applauds the communications strategy adopted by the Ombudsman using various means of informing citizens and raising public awareness which, by helping to establish a variety of forms of dialogue to bring citizens closer to European Union institutions and bodies, should, in the longer term, lead to greater awareness of citizens' rights and Community competences, as well as a greater understanding of the European Ombudsman's sphere of competence;\n",
        "31. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the European Ombudsman, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and their ombudsmen or similar competent bodies.\n"
