It is important that this debate is taking place at a prime time in Parliament’s plenary working day, at a time when it can have a high public profile.\nThe service that the Ombudsman provides is extremely important for the citizen: it enhances the positive connection between Europe’s institutions and the citizen and enriches the legitimacy of the work we do in the institutions, whether it is in Parliament, the Commission or the Council.\nThe service continues to evolve and that is pointed up quite well in Ms Sbarbati’s report, where she makes various suggestions, and the Ombudsman himself makes various suggestions, as to how it could continue to improve. Certainly, the idea of broadening relations with mediators who deal with issues regarding minors and children is an important development.\nAt the same time, there is resistance in the system: resistance to transparency, resistance to a common code of administrative practice for all the institutions and resistance, as well, to updating the mandate of the Ombudsman. I believe the European Parliament should take a more active role, for instance, in dealing with the transparency issue, and I support the Ombudsman’s call for Parliament to be more transparent in the publication of allowances paid to Members.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). – Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and Ms Sbarbati for their excellent work on the Ombudsman’s report.
