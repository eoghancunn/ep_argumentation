{"speaker": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to welcome our visitors, the citizens, to this debate. I hope that they understand what the Ombudsman is about, following his very detailed presentation of twelve months’ work in a very short space of time.\nIt is a pity that the Ombudsman receives so many cases that it is not within his competence to resolve, but I understand that these are redirected to the appropriate places. It is important to say that to people listening to this debate. Those cases do not fall by the wayside, but are sent in the right direction. That you are dealing with a certain number of cases and bringing about a resolution is positive, but we need to do a bit more work to educate people about what you do and how you do it, in order to bring even more cases to your desk. That would do no harm, because I am sure the small number you deal with does not truly reflect the problems of maladministration.\nTurning to the Commission, I quite like the idea of a culture of service, but I am not sure that the Commission uses the carrot and stick approach internally to make sure that there is indeed a culture of service. This is something that should be done through legislation. Are there penalties for divisions or individuals involved in maladministration when it comes to citizens? Perhaps that is something we could have a closer look at.\nI like the idea of putting forward the star performers and the worst performers so that we can have that comparison, but at the end of the day what people want is results and positive outcomes. I keep saying to people in Ireland that the Committee on Petitions does not have huge power, but that through the work we do we can act as a pressure point for action. I wish we had more power, but at least we can use that little bit of pressure to bring about results for citizens. They are not interested in the process. They just want positive outcomes.\nMr Diamandouros, I wish you well in your activities this year and hope you continue in the same way as in the past. I will certainly work in Ireland to make sure that we know a lot more about you in the future.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to welcome our visitors, the citizens, to this debate.
