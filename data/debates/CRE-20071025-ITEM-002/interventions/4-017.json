{"speaker": "Robert Atkins (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Robert Atkins (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and, through her, my colleague, Mr Mavrommatis, but, of course, especially the Ombudsman himself on another successful year.\nThree hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration. Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation, the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make. This must improve, or Parliament will have to find ways of compelling the Commission to be helpful and responsive and, equally, to act upon the conclusions produced by the Ombudsman.\nHe makes telling comments. I want to pick out one: ‘I am not sure that the citizen can easily reconcile the statements often made by the institutions that they want to get “closer to the citizen” with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations.’ The services of the Ombudsman should, and do, work hand in hand with the Committee on Petitions, but the Commission must develop a culture of service rather than the avoidance of problems, and Ministers and permanent representatives must understand the vital importance of responding positively to grievances from constituents and citizens, voiced either through the Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee.\nFinally, may I make a brief reference to an outstanding special report by the Ombudsman, namely that relating to a complaint against OLAF. As the Petitions Committee rapporteur for this issue, I give notice now that, the judicial process having been completed on this case, I will not allow the issue of the special report to be swept under the carpet. It will be reconsidered as soon as is practically possible.\nMay I conclude with thanks, again, not only to you, Madam President, for delighting us with your presence, but also to the Ombudsman and the Commissioner for being here as well.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Robert Atkins (PPE-DE). – Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and, through her, my colleague, Mr Mavrommatis, but, of course, especially the Ombudsman himself on another successful year.\nThree hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration.
