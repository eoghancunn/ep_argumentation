{"speaker": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE),", "english": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – First of all, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Ieke van den Burg, for her excellent report on the White Paper on the financial services policy 2005-2010. This report and the White Paper are indeed of the utmost importance since it is obvious that the creation of a genuine European world leading capital market in line with the objectives of the Lisbon agenda relies profoundly on the viability and consistent nature of the Community’s financial regulations. Besides the viability of the financial regulations in line with the objectives of better regulation, it is necessary to foster the transposition of Community law by the Member States in order to achieve efficiently the thorough implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP). It will of course be necessary to assess the real effects of the implementation of the FSAP for its beneficiaries and, in this respect, I fully support the rapporteur when she calls for a more in-depth examination of the economic effects of the FSAP measures in the light of the Lisbon Strategy. Consistent implementation and continuous evaluation of the financial regulations are indeed the key elements for a successful achievement of a dynamic European world leading capital market.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gábor Harangozó (PSE), in writing . – First of all, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Ieke van den Burg, for her excellent report on the White Paper on the financial services policy 2005-2010.
