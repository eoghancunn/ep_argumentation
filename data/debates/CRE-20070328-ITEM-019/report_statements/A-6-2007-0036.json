        "1.Stresses its attachment to the European Football Model, with its symbiotic relationship between amateur and professional football;\n",
        "2.Points out the importance of the inter-linked national pyramid structures of  European football, which nurture grassroots talent and competition because national leagues and competitions are also the route to European competitions, and a proper balance needs to be struck between the national foundation of the game and the European level to enable football leagues and associations to co-operate efficiently;\n",
        "3.Recognises the need for a joint effort by football governing bodies and political authorities at several levels to counter certain negative developments, such as excessive commercialisation and unfair competition, in order to ensure a positive future for professional football with exciting competitions, a high degree of identification of supporters with their clubs and wide public access to competitions by means of, among others, special ticket prices for young people and families, especially for major international matches;\n",
        "4.Welcomes the recommendations of the \"Independent European Sport Review 2006\" and calls on the Member States,the football governing bodies and the Commission in its forthcoming White Paper on Sport to continue the efforts initiated by the UK Presidency to tackle the need for corrective action by considering the principles and main recommendations of that Review;\n",
        "5.Expresses its desire to avoidthe future of professional football in Europe being determined by court decisions and to create greater legal certainty;\n",
        "6.Agrees with the basic principle that  the economic aspects of professional sport do fall within the scope of the EC Treaty, taking into account the specificity of sport as set out in the Nice Declaration; and considers that in this respect the consequential restrictive effects of a sports decision which cause economic hardship are compatible with EU law, provided they are proportionate and inherent in the pursuit of protecting the nature and purpose of the sport;\n",
        "7.Calls on the Commission to develop guidance on how to apply this principle, and to start a consultation process with the European football authorities with the aim of setting up a formal framework agreement between the EU and the football governing bodies;\n",
        "8.Takes the view that, although it lays down no specific legislative competence for sport, the EC Treaty contains a wide array of instruments which could be employed as part of an action plan, e.g.:\n",
        "9.Asks the Commission, in partnership with Parliament, the Member States and the European and national football governing bodies and other stakeholders,  to include the principles and recommendations contained in this resolution in its forthcoming White Paper, and to establish an action plan for European sport in general and football in particular which sets out the issues for the Commission to deal with and the legal instruments to be used (directives, guidelines, group exemptions, recommendations) in order to create legal certainty and a level playing-field;\n",

        "14.Believes that improved governance leading to more concerted self-regulation at national and European level will reduce the tendency to have recourse to the Commission and the Court of Justice;\n",
        "15.Takes the view that, although sports governing bodies might have a legitimate wish to defend their own sports procedures, applying to the civil courts, even when not justified in sports terms, cannot be penalised by disciplinary regulations; and condemns the arbitrary decisions by FIFA in this respect;\n",
        "16.Urges FIFA to review its statutes, in cooperation with the Commission and the national governing bodies, in order to seek a proper balance between on the one hand the legitimate right of all sport actors to appeal to the civil courts, and on the other hand the normal functioning of competitions;\n",

        "18.Calls on FIFA to increase its internal democracy and the transparency of its structures;\n",
        "19.Believes that the Charleroi case currently before the Court of Justice could seriously undermine the ability of small and medium-sized national football associations to take part in international competitions and threaten the vital investment in grassroots football made by national associations; in this respect, believes that clubs should release their players for national team duty without entitlement to compensation; encourages UEFA and FIFA, together with the European clubs, to reach an agreement on a system of collective insurance being put into place;\n",

        "24.Calls on the Commission to reflect on the introduction of a European legal status for sports companies to take account of the economic activities of major football clubs whilst preserving their specific sports-related characteristics; such a status would make it possible to establish rules for monitoring the economic and financial activities of such companies;\n",
        "25.Asks Member States and football governing bodies to actively promote the social and democratic role of football supporters, for example through the involvement of supporters in the ownership and management of the clubs or through the appointment of a football ombudsman;\n",

        "32.Expresses its clear support for the UEFA measures to encourage the education of young players by requiring a minimum of home-grown players in a professional club’s squad and by placing a limit on the size of the squads; believesthatthese incentivemeasures are proportionate and calls on professional clubs to strictly implement this rule;\n",
        "33.Is convinced that additional arrangements are necessary to ensure that the home-grown players initiative does not lead to child trafficking, with some clubs giving contracts to very young children (below 16 years of age);\n",
        "34.Insists that immigration law must  always be respected in relation to the recruitment of young foreign talent and calls on the Commission to tackle the problem of child trafficking in the context of the Council Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings[1]and / or  in the context of the implementation of Council Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young people at work[2]; points out that young players must be given the opportunity for a general education and vocational training in parallel with their club and training activity, so that they do not entirely depend on the clubs; calls for action to prevent the social exclusion of young people who are ultimately not selected;\n",
        "35.Underlines the important social and educational role of training centres and the vital role which they play in both the well-being of clubs and the future development of football talent, supports financial incentives for clubs with a training centre, provided such incentives are compatible with the Treaty rules on State aid, and asks the Commission to recognise this crucial role when developing guidelines on State aid;\n",

        "40.Believes that the current economic reality surrounding players' agents requires that football governing bodies at all levels, and in consultation with the Commission, to improve the rules governing players' agents; in this respect calls on the Commission to support UEFA’s efforts to regulate players’ agents, if necessary by presenting a proposal for a directive concerning players' agents which would include: strict standards and examination criteria before anyone could operate as a football players' agent; transparency in agents' transactions; minimum harmonised standards for agents' contracts; an efficient monitoring and disciplinary system by the European governing bodies; the introduction of an \"agents' licensing system\" and agents' register; and ending \"dual representation\" and payment of agents by the player;\n",
        "41.Calls on UEFA and the Commission to intensify their efforts to strengthen  the social dialogue at European level on issues such as the duration of contracts, the definition of the transfer window, possibilities for terminating a contract early and compensation for trainer clubs, as it can prevent and overcome tensions between players and employers;\n",

        "49.Considers that football must ensure the interdependence of competitors and the need to guarantee the uncertainty of results of competitions, which could serve as a justification for sports organisations to implement a specific framework on the market for the production and the sale of sport events; however, considers that such specific features do not warrant an automatic exemption from the Community competition rules for any economic activities generated by professional football, owing to the increasing economic weight of such activities;\n",
        "50.Asks the Commission to draw up clear guidelines on the application of State aid rules, indicating what kind of public support is acceptable and legitimate in order tofulfil the social, cultural and educational role played by football,such asfinancial or other support granted by public authorities for the provision or updating of football stadiiums or facilities;\n",

        "53.Notes that there is often a mismatch between the supply of, and demand for, tickets for major football events which is beneficial to sponsors but detrimental to consumers; stresses that the interests of consumers should be fully taken into account when it comes to the distribution of tickets and that non-discriminatory and fair ticket sales should be guaranteed at all levels; acknowledges however that the distribution of tickets may, where appropriate, be restricted to members of supporters clubs, travel clubs or similar schemes, membership of which is available on a non-discriminatory basis;\n",
        "54.Maintains that collective selling in all competitions is fundamental to protecting the financial solidarity model of European football; welcomes a public debate on and further investigation by the Commission into whether this model should be adopted across Europe for both pan-European and domestic competitions, as suggested by the Independent Sport Review 2006; in this respect, calls on the Commission to provide a detailed evaluation of the economic and sports impact of its relevant media rights decisions and the extent to which they have or have not worked;\n",
        "55.Stresses that the sale of media rights vested in the European national football leagues should always comply with EC competition law, taking into account the specificity of sport, and be negotiated and completed in a transparent manner; but with that proviso believes that  football broadcasts should be accessible to the widest possible range of people including through free-to-air channels;\n",
        "56.Stresses that the merit of Article 3a of the current “Television without Frontiers Directive” can hardly be overestimated;\n",
        "57.Points out that it is vital for professional football that the revenues from television rights be distributed in a fair way that ensures solidarity between the professional and amateur games, and between competing clubs in all competitions; notes that the current distribution of television revenues in the UEFA Champions League to a significant degree reflects the size of the clubs' national television markets; notes that this favours big countries, thereby diminishing the power of clubs from smaller countries;\n",
        "58.Therefore invites UEFA together with the Commission tocontinue to examine mechanisms to create a more competitive balance in this fieldby increased redistribution;\n",
        "59.Points out that the televised broadcasting of sports competitions is increasingly taking place on encrypted and pay TV channels, and that such competitions are thus becoming inaccessible to a number of consumers;\n",
        "60.Recommends that the prevention of and fight against doping should constitute an important concern for the Member States; calls for a policy aimed at preventing and combating doping and stresses the need to fight irregularities through checks, research, testing, long-term monitoring by independent doctors and through education and, at the same time, prevention and training; calls on professional clubs to adopt a pledge to combat doping and to monitor compliancethrough internal checks;\n",
        "61.Calls on the Commission to set up an independent doping control body equivalent to WADA, exclusively for football with comparable conditions and procedures; considers that operational expenditure, the establishment the seat of this body in a Member State and other details may be decided jointly by the Commission, FIFA and UEFA and the national governments; 0 0         0\n",
        "62. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States, UEFA and FIFA.\n"
