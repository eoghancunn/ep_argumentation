{"speaker": "Colm Burke (PPE-DE). -", "english": "Colm Burke (PPE-DE). - Madam President, I warmly welcome this report. An integrated ports policy is necessary to boost trade and investment, while taking advantage of the environmental benefits of maritime transport. There are also massive gains to be made by greater cooperation between ports and different Member States.\nIn my own city of Cork and ports there, there is a proposal for a new service between that port and a port in Spain. Currently there is no roll-on roll-off link between these Member States. The benefits will accrue not only to Ireland and Spain, but also to the UK and France. Road freight between Ireland and Spain must now pass through the UK and France, adding to the congestion on their roads. Road freight will be taken off already congested motorways and transported over a shorter route by sea, saving time, money and carbon emissions.\nHowever, a word of warning must be added. The port I referred to has recently attempted to relocate to a location outside the city, to deeper water. Unfortunately, planning was refused by the planning board, who are not accountable to the Government. They refused on the grounds that there was no rail link to the new proposed facility. The Government does not have any policy on freight transport by rail. This displays a lack of integrated thinking, where policymaking is uncoordinated across government agencies. Therefore I welcome this report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Colm Burke (PPE-DE). - Madam President, I warmly welcome this report.
