{"speaker": "Hélène Goudin (IND/DEM). -", "english": "Hélène Goudin (IND/DEM). - (SV) Madam President, when the Ports Directive was up for debate in 2006, the June List clearly and emphatically voted against it. The reason for our opposition to the directive is that the ports of Europe already work well and are competitive even from an international perspective. The report we are now debating contains several elements which were included in the Ports Directive that we voted against. Furthermore, the report contains many proposals which are as worrying as they are undesirable.\nFor example, it is proposed that Community-cleared goods are to be exempt from customs controls. This is a major problem, particularly regarding the smuggling of drugs, for example. It should be up to each Member State to decide whether a container is to be opened or not.\nThis is a report which stinks of unnecessary regulation, hidden protectionism and major costs for the taxpayer. Therefore I urge you all to vote against it tomorrow.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Hélène Goudin (IND/DEM). - (SV) Madam President, when the Ports Directive was up for debate in 2006, the June List clearly and emphatically voted against it.
