    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Is concerned at the abnormal increase in the number of trade defence cases involving both 'traditional' users of trade defence instruments and other, more recently-developed WTO members; considers that, in many of these cases, the WTO's rules and case law have been partially or completely disregarded, thus causing unjustified damage to the Community's industry;\n",
        "2.  Calls on the Community's trade partners to comply more closely with the spirit and the letter of the agreements in force and the WTO's case law on trade defence instruments so as to avoid any form of protectionism; calls, in particular, for anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations, and safeguard actions, to be carried out in a transparent and impartial manner;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the help provided by the Commission to Member States and European industry in trade defence cases brought by third countries; urges the Commission to constantly monitor the action taken by third countries to ensure that it is appropriate and fair;\n",
        "4.  Encourages the Commission to intervene, together with the Member States concerned, to defend the Community's industry whenever it is ascertained that the rules of international trade are being flouted;\n",
        "5.  Takes the view that many of the disputes caused by the application of trade defence measures could be resolved amicably to the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned; considers, however, that, in cases where it does not prove possible to reach a compromise solution within a reasonable period, the Commission should not hesitate to refer the matter to the WTO's dispute settlement body in order to resolve the issue;\n",
        "6.  Expresses satisfaction with the success achieved by the WTO's dispute settlement system, which has led to a more consistent application of the multilateral rules of international trade, thus placing the system on a more secure and reliable basis;\n",
        "7.   However, calls on the Commission to campaign for action to ensure that the decisions of the WTO's dispute settlement body are implemented more promptly and effectively, to avoid the unjustified use of delaying tactics and to make the implementation of international trade law more certain;\n",
        "8.   Calls on the Commission to resolutely press ahead with negotiations in the WTO to make the application of trade defence measures by other WTO Membersmore effective and less arbitrary, focusing in particular on the following points: (a) application of more stringent rules to the five-yearly reviews, to make the extension of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures exceptional; (b) simplification of anti-dumping procedures and a reduction in their cost for firms which cooperate with the investigating authority; (c) analysis of the public interest and the impact of the measures in question, along the lines of that conducted in the Community; (d) increased transparency in investigations, to avoid illegal practices and guarantee the right to defence for the parties concerned; (e) limitation of measures to that which is strictly necessary in order to eliminate injurious dumping; (f) establishment of an ad hoc arbitration group - consisting of relevant experts - to which decisions to open anti-dumping investigations would be referred, and which would be able to order the investigation to be terminated without delay if the rules were infringed; the ad hoc group should have clear guidelines regarding the relevant expertise of its members on the subject in question;\n",
        "9.   Regrets that, despite the anomalies identified in the application of safeguard measures, this point was not included in the DDA;\n",
        "10.  Calls on the Commission, therefore, to campaign at the WTO for a radical revision of the rules governing the imposition of safeguard measures to avoid the excessive and unjustified use of such measures;\n",
        "11. Invites the Commission to consider whether it would be appropriate to radically revise the rules on the use of trade defence (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy) measures under the WTO aegis;\n",
        "12. Urges the Member States to maintain a 'communal' approach to these issues which would enable the measures in question to be applied more harmoniously in the Community context and reduce the number of actions taken against the Community by bringing sustained pressure to bear at political and technical level on WTO members which intend to apply trade defence measures, while constantly endeavouring to raise awareness of the issues involved;  however, 'communal' action must not be used as an excuse to support unfair trading practices by individual Member States;\n",
        "13. Stresses that only by adopting a \"Community\" approach will it be possible to defend effectively the legitimate interests of Europe's small and medium-sized exporting firms faced with protectionist practices on the part of importing countries;\n",
        "14. Recommends that the Community refrain from granting preferential treatment to trade partners which are not acting in accordance with WTO rules and case-law, if such action is damaging Community industry; also urges the Commission to take the principle of reciprocity into account when dealing with trade defence cases involving those trade partners;\n",
        "15. Stresses that, if the new rules on international trade are to win public support, they must be applied transparently and consistently, in compliance with the principle of the rule of law, both within and outside the Community;\n",
        "16. Favours granting preferential treatment to least developed countries which are starting their industrialisation processes to enable them to protect their infant industries from the dangers of excessive external competition, provided any such derogation from the WTO's general principles is temporary and brings real benefits for the world's least developed countries;\n",
        "17. Encourages the setting up of technicaltraining programmes on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions for any candidate countries and developing countries that request them;also urges the Commission to provide assistance and support to developing countries which set up a trade defence system which is compatible with WTO rules;\n",
        "18. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
