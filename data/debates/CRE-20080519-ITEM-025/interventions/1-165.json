{"speaker": "Bairbre de Brún", "english": "Bairbre de Brún , Rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank those who spoke in the debate tonight. I listened carefully to them and to the points they raised. I am disappointed, however, by what Mr Allister had to say and I cannot agree with his allegations. I would like to praise the work the European Parliament and the Commission have done over the years in terms of the PEACE programme.\nI would like especially to thank Commissioner Hübner for the personal commitment she has shown from her first day in that post and for her regular visits to Northern Ireland. Commissioner Hübner and the previous Commissioners have been true friends to the peace process in Ireland and it is reassuring to see the continuing role the Commission will have through the task force that was set up by President Barroso.\nPEACE enabled a border community divided from the time of the partition to come together as a community. It brought young nationalists and unionists together to learn about each other’s cultures. We especially acknowledge the important role women have in building peace and the important and valuable cross-community and cross-border work that has been done.\nMy Report highlights the fact that it is the most marginalised people in society who benefited most from PEACE, which is just as it should be. Nevertheless, if there are groups which have not already used this opportunity to make an application under PEACE I and PEACE II they should be encouraged to participate. The next step is to ensure that the good work that PEACE has done doesn’t stop and that future generations benefit from the valuable work that started with the PEACE programmes and from the wonderful support the European institutions have provided.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Bairbre de Brún , Rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank those who spoke in the debate tonight.
