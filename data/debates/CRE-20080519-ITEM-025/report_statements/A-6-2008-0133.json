    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Stresses that local empowerment is an essential part of peace-building and that the participation of civil society improves policy-making and the way in which society is governed;\n",
        "2.  Points out that the development of various implementation mechanisms together with the voluntary sector, non-governmental organisations and local authorities has provided wide-ranging experience of dealing with EU funds; hopes that such bottom-up provision mechanisms may be used in the implementation of other funding programmes;\n",
        "3.  Welcomes the contribution made by the PEACE and IFI programmes to economic and social development; notes that one enterprise centre established, before the implementation of the IFI, in a deprived area developed with the support of the IFI and the local district council into a network of thirty two enterprise centres, which helped boost confidence and hope amongst those involved;\n",
        "4.  Emphasises that the cooperation between participants in programmes financed by PEACE and IFI should not cease when the programmes comes to an end; calls on government departments to maintain that work, which proved to be effective, and ensure that funding continues for this invaluable work once all PEACE funding finally comes to an end;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the governments of both the United Kingdom and Ireland specifically to put in place temporary funding arrangements for community and voluntary groups in order to bridge the gap between the end of PEACE II funding programmes and the beginning of PEACE III funding programmes;\n",
        "6.  Calls on the Commission and the governments of the United Kingdom and  Ireland to engage with the Commissioners for Victims and Survivors with a view to finding a way for victim and survivor support groups to continue to receive financial support after the termination of all PEACE funding;\n",
        "7.  Calls on the Commission, in relation to the TFNI, to replicate the active citizenship approach of the PEACE I and PEACE II programmes, when structuring future initiatives; recalls the importance for the stabilisation of the peace process of balanced regional development including attention to infrastructure which is underdeveloped in comparison with that of other regions in the EU, and calls on the TFNI to be more positive in its support for infrastructure improvement;\n",
        "8.  Calls for the further development of cross-border work, given that cross-border work has been central to the regeneration of urban and rural communities in the border areas; urges the further development of co-operation between local chambers of commerce and public sector bodies as well as forums for the voluntary and community sectors on both sides of the border and for voluntary organisations that already work on a cross-border basis;\n",
        "9.  Calls on the Government of Ireland to implement Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 immediately;\n",
        "10. Urges the widespread use of consultation, both large and small-scale and with a local focus, within the funding programmes and emphasises the importance of securing schemes that allow for the approval of small grants to fund work that is needed at short notice and work where its results cannot be easily quantified as well as schemes that ensure long-term sustainability and can make a contribution to local communities;\n",
        "11. Calls for a reduction in bureaucracy to ensure that small projects are not overburdened;\n",
        "12. Recognises that peace-building is a long-term, evolutionary process and that robust development towards peace and reconciliation takes time; calls for a longer time-frame for individual grants in order to allow projects to make a difference; recognises that not only economic initiatives but also cultural and sporting initiatives can make a significant contribution to peace and reconciliation and should therefore continue to be promoted;\n",
        "13. Notes that the social economy sector is a sub-sector of the voluntary and community sectors the consultation of which is important in order to develop local strategies and areas; considers that other local businesses are also influential participants;\n",
        "14. Emphasises that development in rural areas requires greater synergies between agricultural, rural and regional development funding and between nature conservation, ecotourism and the production and use of renewable energy than has been the case to date;\n",
        "15. Emphasises that people should have easy access to information on the success stories of projects funded by PEACE I and PEACE II as well as the IFI; believes that the experience gained from such projects  should be shared with those engaged in other international peace-building work; calls, in this connection, for the establishment of a database as a learning tool for peace and reconciliation work at home and abroad; calls, in addition,  for every level of participation to be included in the creation of regional and metropolitan networks;\n",
        "16. Recommends that comprehensive strategies be put in place to ensure not only that examples of good-practice are available, but also that they are used at every stage of the project cycle, i.e. project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation;\n",
        "17. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.\n"
