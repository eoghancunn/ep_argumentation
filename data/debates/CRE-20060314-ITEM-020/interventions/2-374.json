{"speaker": "Neena Gill,", "english": "Neena Gill, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Grech for his hard work and the excellent report he has produced on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure.\nI really hope, as the report suggests, that the institutions can submit realistic requests based on budgetary rigour in the light of the current tight financial situation. Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that in all the institutions we can work more cost-effectively, without compromising standards. I would urge all those responsible – which means each of us and all members of all the institutions – to keep this in mind and change our working habits accordingly.\nI should like to highlight some other aspects of the report that I believe are particularly important. We have had a reference to the area of information and communication. I applaud the emphasis on results as opposed simply to spending. Expensive solutions are not always the most effective. As the rapporteur suggests, we should not be afraid to discontinue tools or strategies that are not delivering the desired results. That means regular monitoring and clear and appropriate distribution of responsibilities.\nWe have had a reference to information tools. One idea that has been explored is web-TV. I am firmly in support of that idea. Very many young people actually get most of their information from the internet. If it is properly managed and properly handled, it could be a new way of connecting with citizens and pushing forward our objectives. We need to find better ways, but this needs to be properly handled. I am very much in favour of the idea of having web-TV and seeing how all the institutions can work together to get our information across to different members of society.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Neena Gill, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Grech for his hard work and the excellent report he has produced on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure.\nI really hope, as the report suggests, that the institutions can submit realistic requests based on budgetary rigour in the light of the current tight financial situation.
