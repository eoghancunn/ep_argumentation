    "paragraphs": [
        "1.      Notes that, in the absence of an agreement on a a new Interinstitutional Agreement amongst the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission for the period 2007-2013, Article 26 of the current IIA would in principle apply; in the event that any of the Institutions denounce the current IIA, the provisions of the EU Treaty (Art. 272) applies;\n",
        "2.      Expects a detailed report on the developments in heading 5 by the Secretaries-General in March 2006, which should serve as a basis for consideration of the preliminary draft 2007 budget;\n",
        "3.      Underlines that the 2007 draft budget will have to take into account the accession of Romania and Bulgaria as of 1 January 2007;\n",

        "8.      Calls on all institutions to submit realistic requests which would have to be based on justified needs taking into account the tight financial situation; encourages the institutions to operate at the lowest cost base possible without compromising standards;\n",

        "12.    Notes that over the years European institutions have failed to convince European citizens that they truly represent their interests and aspirations; insufficient knowledge coupled with a poor perception makes understanding of EU policies difficult; takes the view that the existing information services have to be improved and that an effective strategy, accessible to all European citizens, should be implemented as a matter of priority for all institutions;\n",
        "13.    Invites all European institutions to study the feasibility of setting up a Centre of European Houses in Brussels, utilising existing resources without incurring any significant additional expenditure; in this \"European Heart\", EU citizens would be able to participate freely in various areas, including cultural and technical events, training seminars and exhibitions on specific topics; in such a scenario a wider segment of European citizens can identify themselves with the intellectual and cultural diversity of all European Member States;\n",

        "15.    Commits itself to fulfil its responsibilities as the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU;\n",
        "16.    Considers that, in view of the financial constraints being experienced at the moment, Parliament should reserve its position regarding the self-imposed limit of 20% of the expenditure under heading 5; reiterates that its estimates should reflect the real financial requirements in order to ensure an appropriate and efficient functioning of the institutions;\n",
        "17.    Urges the Administration to make better and more efficient use of resources and avoid duplication of functions and reduce activities which do not add value to the overall objectives; expects more internal control on expenditure;\n",
        "18.    Regrets the unnecessary and exorbitant costs due to the dispersion and duplication of activities in three different workplaces, which contribute to a highly inefficient cost structure; considers that this should be re-addressed in an effort to minimise costs and invites the Administration to present specific proposals by 30 June 2006;\n",
        "19.    Invites the Administration to compare contracts with standards used in major private companies, in order to ensure the highest cost/benefit ratio for users, with particular reference to telecom providers, computer services, hardware and software providers, catering, sports facilities, car services and travel services;\n",
        "20.    Expects a report on the progress registered in the area of interinstitutional cooperation and asks the Secretary-General to make recommendations on the possibilities and limits for further tangible interinstitutional cooperation;\n",
        "21.    Contends that appropriations should relate to specific activities thus avoiding the  cancellation of appropriations at the end of the year; recommends that sufficient funding should be allocated in areas where political decisions necessitate greater financial engagement, as in the case of the WTO; stresses that, wherever possible, amending budgets and transfers should be avoided;\n",
        "22.    Stresses, once again, the importance of applying the principles of sound financial management and underlines the importance of the full implementation of Activity Based Budgeting which should result in having more effective, transparent, rational and analytical estimates;\n",
        "23.    Recalls its decision to make the budget more comprehensive;  notes the introduction of the revised nomenclature and requests the Administration to provide its relevant committee for the 2007 budget with a presentation which makes the comparison between the 2006 and 2007 budgets possible;\n",

        "26.    Notes that an amount of EUR 23 526 000 was allocated in the 2006 budget for the pre-enlargement preparations for Romania and Bulgaria; invites the Administration to be prepared to offer adequatetraining programmes for staff coming from Romania and Bulgaria;\n",
        "27.    Invites the Bureau, in the event of a postponement of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, to consider whether Bulgarian and Romanian contract agents, already recruited by Parliament, should be given the task of acting as liaison officers, assisting the Bulgarian and Romanian observers in this respect;\n",
        "28.    Agrees with the Secretary-General that the European Parliament requires a strong and effective information strategy that addresses Parliament's objective of bringing Europe closer to its citizens; information tools and strategies which are not delivering the expected results should be discontinued; considers that spending more does not necessarily translate into better results; recommends that all Members, political groups and Administration should be involved and assume responsibility for their respective roles in the fields of information;\n",

        "31.    Points out that a significant percentage of EU citizens do not have access to the Internet and do not necessarily use it to gather information about EU policies, and that therefore the role of Information Offices should be adequately defined and their management coherent when considering Parliament’s information tools; attention should be given to ways of avoiding the duplication of information from various institutions;\n",
        "32.    Emphasises that particular attention should be given to any information project, not only for its cost structure, but also for the value of its contents; recommends that all major publications and information-related projects be prepared and constantly monitored by regular meetings with the participation and cooperation of political groups in order to create balanced programmes respecting the pluralism of opinions; the level of success of any project will have to be measured in terms of its positive impact on EU citizens;\n",
        "33.    Considers that Parliament's visitors' service is of utmost importance to MEPs; visitors groups are the only efficient way for Members to bring opinion-makers from their constituencies to the workplaces of the Parliament; regrets, therefore, the high number of complaints concerning the visitors' programme, particularly as regards the non-availability of time-slots and the difference between grants and real costs; stresses that an attractive and high value visitors' programme is one of the top priorities for the year 2007;\n",
        "34.    Regrets that improvements in the visitors' programme are long overdue and considers that they should not be delayed any further; recalls that in 2006 budget EUR 5 million were allocated to increase the number of visitors and to reimburse expenses covering the actual cost of travel expenditure;\n",
        "35.    Calls for a better reception service for visitors in the various places of EP plenary sittings and for an increase in the number of meeting areas furnished with modern communication and information tools; recalls that the visitors' programme is one of the most effective ways of how citizens can participate actively in Parliament's work thereby enhancing the citizens perception of the EP;\n",

        "41.    Supports the Secretary-General’s intention to undertake an evaluation of the state of implementation of the project;\n",
        "42.    Stresses that it is imperative to give more assistance to Members when it comes to responding to requests from concerned citizens regarding day-to-day issues;\n",
        "43.    Recommends further promotion of the \"Correspondence with Citizens Unit\" so that Members can make better use of this service;\n",
        "44.    Takes the view that Parliament's increased responsibilities in legislative decision-making require more resources to be allocated in support of this core activity, especially in the areas of research, library and specific expertise;\n",
        "45.    Encourages the Administration to conduct a quality survey on the service and assistance being given to Members and to make the findings of the survey available to all Members by the first reading of the 2007 budget; asks the Secretary General to involve all Members in the survey in order to avoid any misleading results; expects immediate proposals for improvements in response to any major deficiency detected by the survey;\n",

        "47.    Underlines the importance of personal assistants for Members' work and reiterates its position in support of the adoption of a real and meaningful statute for Members' assistants; regrets that very little progress has been achieved on the matter; urges the Council to take a decision on the EC Staff Regulation: EP Members' assistant statute (COM(1998)0312), which ideally should come into force by 2009;;\n",
        "48.    Notes the lack of immediate availability of training offered to assistants and staff on their arrival in the European Parliament; considers that a more holistic approach to training development and induction should be initiated in order to enable assistants and staff to fulfil their duties in a professional manner and achieve high standards of work, and to develop further the scope of the European Administration School;\n",
        "49. Suggests that a traineeship programme in favour of persons with disabilities be formulated in order to better facilitate their integration in the European working environment; invites the other institutions to formulate a similar programme;\n",
        "50.    Points out that the policy on the purchasing of properties and buildings has yielded positive and tangible results providing Parliament with a strong asset base as well as generating savings, which in turn allowed it to use these funds for other projects;\n",

        "54.    Invites the Administration to ensure that human resources costs are in line with operational requirements and with the financial situation of the institution and effectively to examine the possibility of redeploying existing staff instead of relying on contract agents;\n",

        "56.    Instructs the Administration to address the problem of staff shortages in a number of European Houses, including a press officer for each office; an identical request was made by the previous rapporteur but has not been fully implemented;\n",

        "58.    Notes that problems are likely because of staff ageing and the resulting increasing number of individuals leaving the service (with some 180 staff members leaving the service each year from 2009 onwards); asks the Administration to make appropriation preparations for the likely increase in funding requirements;\n",
        "59.    Recalls that the new Streamline software should be in place by the last quarter of 2006; this should result in a decrease in the number of posts in the coming years; maintains that, with the exception of enlargement and an extremely limited recruitment of specialised staff, no new employment should take place, which should result in real savings in the future;\n",
        "60.    Takes note that in 2007 there will be no new major projects being undertaken by Parliament; therefore considers that now is the opportune time to examine, evaluate and carry out a meaningful stocktaking exercise; encourages the Secretary-General to implement the necessary changes resulting from this exercise;\n",
