{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott,", "english": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, in recent years there have been many humanitarian crises and as many emergency aid programmes. Every day, people are suffering from food shortages and disease; every year there are numerous natural disasters which leave thousands without shelter and a way back to regular life.\nThe principal issues in crises like these are securing the safety of the area and of the people, attending to medical needs and providing food, water and shelter. These immediate issues are primary and all efforts should be directed towards them. Unfortunately, victims have limited access to humanitarian aid, and humanitarian aid workers’ lives are being put at risk, due to the rising internal conflict in some countries.\nSometimes, after the immediate crisis is over and the aid ends, the suffering can again become acute because nothing has been put in place to help people rebuild and be independent in the long run. This is our most important duty: that of aiding others in their time of greatest need. Problems with this cannot be allowed to continue and we must find another way to help in both the short and the long term.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . – Mr President, in recent years there have been many humanitarian crises and as many emergency aid programmes.
