{"speaker": "Toomas Savi,", "english": "Toomas Savi, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, first I would like to refer to paragraph 21 of Mr Cornillet’s report, which considers that the consensus should recognise and further define the different roles, mandates and comparative advantages of the various humanitarian actors.\nIn the case of the new Member States, there are some countries, including my own, which could perform most efficiently when cooperating with the others, pooling their skills and resources and sharing individual know-how. When put into practice, this could benefit a lot of the humanitarian activities of the EU and enable the new Member States to become further involved in European policies. However, the European Union should be ready to start centralising its agencies to coordinate its activities in the best possible way.\nThe second point that I would like to make is that the contribution of the new Member States to humanitarian aid tends to be rather modest. The new Member States that relied on development assistance and humanitarian aid nearly two decades ago now luxuriate in rapid economic growth. I encourage those countries to increase their contribution vigorously and remember that this is a chance to assist less-developed countries in the same way that the developed world lent them a hand not so long ago.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Toomas Savi, on behalf of the ALDE Group . – Mr President, first I would like to refer to paragraph 21 of Mr Cornillet’s report, which considers that the consensus should recognise and further define the different roles, mandates and comparative advantages of the various humanitarian actors.\nIn the case of the new Member States, there are some countries, including my own, which could perform most efficiently when cooperating with the others, pooling their skills and resources and sharing individual know-how.
