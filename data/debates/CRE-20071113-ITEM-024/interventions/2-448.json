{"speaker": "Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE),", "english": "Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE), in writing . – I welcome this initiative by the institutions to establish an EU Consensus on Humanitarian Aid. It will provide, for the first time, a clear statement of EU policy regarding humanitarian aid.\nThe environment where humanitarian action is taking place is evolving rapidly and continually poses new challenges.\nThere are increasing numbers of vulnerable people in crisis situations and in natural disasters. In 2003 there were 200 million people affected, with 45 million people in need of life-saving assistance. Since then we have had the Asian tsunami, numerous earthquakes, floods and hurricanes affecting Central America and the horrific situation in Darfur.\nThe Consensus will underline the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.\nDevelopment assistance is a crucial link to preventing humanitarian emergencies. Disaster risk reduction and a clear commitment to link relief, rehabilitation and development are essential.\nMilitary forces have become increasingly involved in the provision of relief and reconstruction assistance to civilian populations. Such encroachment into what has traditionally been seen as humanitarian or development space raises important questions.\nThe distinction between civilian and military actors is a concern for many working in the humanitarian field. The mandates of the different actors must be clearly defined.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE), in writing . – I welcome this initiative by the institutions to establish an EU Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.
