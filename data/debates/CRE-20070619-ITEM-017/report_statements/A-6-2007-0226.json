        "2.   Considers that Member States should make full use of the Commission's assistance in the transposition process;\n",
        "3.   Considers that the Commission should be given the human resources to police late and incorrect transposition more effectively;\n",
        "4.  Stresses that Member States should actively exchange knowledge and best practice with each other on transposing public procurement legislation and improve cooperation with the Commission in this field;\n",
        "5.   Considers that the inconsistent transposition of the optional elements of the new public sector Directive could have an adverse effect on the internal market, and accordingly encourages Member States to consider adopting all flexibility options; stresses in particular that these options could reduce the risk of illegal practices;\n",
        "6.   Calls accordingly on the Commission to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of non-harmonised transposition of the optional elements of the new public sector Directive on cross-border tendering in the EU;\n",
        "7.   Strongly believes that breaches of the rules could be reduced if Member States and the Commission introduced more collaborative practices; encourages therefore Member States and the Commission to actively promote informal exchanges at an early stage;\n",
        "8.  Considers that, given the number of infringements, the Commission should be given the human resources to police the implementation of public procurement legislation more effectively;\n",
        "9.   Calls on the Member States to provide the Commission with sufficient data on the implementation of the public procurement directives; urges moreover Member States and the Commission to work together towards increasing the capacity for better data collection and for better policing of transposition and implementation problems;\n",

        "11. Calls on Member States to focus national efforts on detecting and sanctioning illegal practices and ensuring that all relevant national court judgments and ECJ rulings are respected;\n",

        "16. Considers that Member States should devote more capacity to raising the level of procurement professionalism and sharing best practice at the national level to ensure consistent and even application of the public procurement rules by all contracting authorities and in areas of the rules where there is less clarity, particularly procurements falling outside the full scope of the Directives;\n",
        "17. Points out that the systematic training of procurement professionals across the EU would enhance the transparency of national implementation measures and procedures in public procurement across the EU;\n",
        "18. Stresses that a change is needed to move away from a budget-based approach to an outcome-focussed approach in public procurement, looking at whole project-cycle costs and requiring purchasing professionals to develop sound management and economic skills;\n",

        "22. Recommends that the Commission propose an action plan to encourage Member States to fulfil their obligation to tackle persistent and emerging transposition and implementation problems in public procurement, focusing on illegal direct awards and late or incorrect transposition; * *     *\n",
