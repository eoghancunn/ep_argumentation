{"speaker": "Zita Pleštinská (PPE-DE).", "english": "Zita Pleštinská (PPE-DE). – ( SK ) I welcome the report by the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, who has highlighted problems relating to the transposition and implementation of public procurement legislation, which is increasingly important for EU economic growth and the internal market. Public procurement markets in Member States must open to cross-border competition in order to create a level playing field across the Community, especially for suppliers such as small and medium-sized enterprises.\nThe new directive clarifies how environmental and social requirements should be fulfilled. Care should be taken, however, that procuring entities do not apply these criteria in a way discriminating against firms from other Member States. I agree with the rapporteur that setting up national advisory agencies would help contracting agencies to apply public procurement rules properly and to assist tenderers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in bidding for public orders.\nA highly professional and depoliticised administration is key to the successful implementation of European legislation. Only professional officials with ample experience in civil service or local government work, as well as regular training, would be able to respond appropriately to the new challenges posed by European legislation. The new post-communist Member States in particular seem to have invented a national sport, whereby a new government after taking office seeks to replace virtually all civil servants in positions which should be filled on the merit of professionalism.\nBased on my many years of experience in civil service and local government positions, and drawing on my track record in public procurement, I am convinced that only a professional and credible administration will be able to transpose EU legislation into national law in a responsible manner. It is important that Member States should not impose responsibilities on individuals and legal entities above and beyond the transposed rules, and, in particular, should not impose an unnecessary administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.
