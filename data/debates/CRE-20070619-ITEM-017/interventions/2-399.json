{"speaker": "Charlie McCreevy,", "english": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission . Mr President, as you know, the Commission is currently reflecting on the future of the single market. This autumn, we hope to bring forward our ideas on what should be the focus of single market policy in the coming years.\nOne major element of our analysis concerns the question of how better to ensure that Community law is correctly applied on the ground. I welcome the fact that you are devoting a report to this issue, which is specifically focused on public procurement, and I commend your rapporteur Mrs McCarthy on the initiative.\nAs a key recommendation, the report suggests setting up national advisory bodies to assist contracting authorities as well as tenderers. Such a contact point at national level could play an important role in securing the correct application of public procurement rules. Bringing public procurement advice closer to the numerous contracting authorities and individual tenderers, via a national body, is good idea. The Commission is ready to cooperate with such national contact points and to respond to any inquiry they might have.\nMember States should take up the suggestions in the report and, for example, set up such a national advisory body. Some Member States are currently in the process of setting up contact points, or internal market centres, which could assist firms and citizens in the context of SOLVIT, the free movement of goods, or the Services Directive. I welcome such initiatives and hope that such national bodies will extend their activity to all internal market sectors, including public procurement.\nWe also wish to assure you that the Commission is deploying all available means to secure the implementation of 2004 procurement directives as quickly as possible in those Member States which are still lagging behind. I regret that our efforts to give all possible advice and assistance could not prevent the fact that we had to take legal action against a number of Member States for failure to complete their transposition process. However, we cannot afford to lose time in establishing a level playing field among tenderers across Europe.\nIn conclusion, let me underline that we need Member States’ commitment to the cause of public procurement if we want to achieve progress in correct transposition and implementation. Public procurement cases still represent far too big a share of infringement cases brought against Member States. This is to the detriment of fair competition between tenderers. It is also to the detriment of public finances, and thus taxpayers. Your report highlights the need for improvement, and I thank the House for your support.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlie McCreevy, Member of the Commission .
