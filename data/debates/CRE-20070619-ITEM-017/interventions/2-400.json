{"speaker": "Charlotte Cederschiöld,", "english": "Charlotte Cederschiöld, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, first of all I express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, for an excellent report.\nLately, I have noticed a tendency in the European Parliament that I, as a European, find worrying: a weakened respect for the ECJ rulings. The ECJ takes no national considerations into account its judgments: it takes the interests of the Union and its citizens into account. Furthermore, it is one of the bases of the Treaty that the case-law of the ECJ is applicable in every Member State. Our role in the European Parliament is mainly legislative. In fulfilling our task it is crucial for us to use the European approach of the ECJ as our loadstone, rather than seeing the ECJ as an enemy – a view that is not so rare nowadays, unfortunately.\nThe legislation on public procurement is still suffering from quite a few teething problems. Many of the problems are caused by the lack of, or difficulties with, national implementation. It must always be our goal, and the goal of the Member States, to make the legislation as understandable and adaptable to real needs as possible. SMEs should be able to participate in the cross-border market in reality, not only in theory.\nWe must make the framework for the public-private partnerships work and create legal certainty for companies as well as for public authorities, and check that all act according to EU legislation without imposing unnecessary red tape. It is our task to make sure that local and national interests will not overrun our European goal, which is, and should be, the best result for all European citizens and entrepreneurs.\nI shall finish by expressing confidence in the Commission and in our future good cooperation.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Charlotte Cederschiöld, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – Mr President, first of all I express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, for an excellent report.\nLately, I have noticed a tendency in the European Parliament that I, as a European, find worrying: a weakened respect for the ECJ rulings.
