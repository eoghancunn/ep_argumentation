All I would say is that, when I say to Mr Booth that this public procurement regime should represent the biggest possible advantages for small businesses across Europe, I am sure we can find a hat maker to provide him with a hat that he will eat in due course!\nI want to thank Mrs McCarthy not just for this report but for setting out a clear course for our committee in leading the scrutiny of these public procurement directives and raising them in political prominence. After all, the whole public procurement regime was really the first fully worked-through piece of internal market legislation dating back to the 1950s and yet, in many cases, I wonder whether enough businesses see this as a real opportunity.\nThe prime suggestion here is that Member States really need to get their act together in improving their professionalism in dealing with procurement, opening up opportunities that will not just encourage economic growth across Europe but also deliver better quality services to their citizens by reducing costs and improving quality. We know that, where that has happened, clear benefits are being delivered, and those small businesses need to be catered for in this process.\nMy closing point, in thanking Mrs McCarthy for accepting one of my own amendments, is to say that public authorities, with the huge amounts they are buying, also have a real responsibility to be encouraging innovation in products and services. Within the remit of the existing directives, they can set up pre-procurement arrangements or pre-competitive arrangements to pull through into the marketplace innovative solutions that will deliver real benefits to citizens.
