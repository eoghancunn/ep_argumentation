{"speaker": "Cristian Silviu Buşoi (ALDE). -", "english": "Cristian Silviu Buşoi (ALDE). - Mr President, the telecom package is an important step forward in modernising and harmonising telecommunications in Europe. I worked on the citizens’ rights directive and, together with the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, we did a lot of work and we reached consensus on many issues.\nThis directive will ensure better protection of consumer rights in electronic communications. Number portability, and privacy protection and security in telecommunications are other examples of improvements brought by this directive.\nWe had a very delicate discussion on network neutrality. My opinion is that extreme network neutrality, as we experienced in some amendments, will make networks more congested, slower, less efficient and more expensive. Network management is necessary to run efficient and intelligent networks and to maximise the overall user experience and value. I am very satisfied that we agreed on amendments regarding the emergency number 112 and, after the directive has been adopted, Member States will make further efforts to inform and educate the public on the use of 112. The 112 number will be made accessible from the entire EU territory and Member States will have to ensure the implementation of caller location.\nIn addition, access to emergency services through 112 may be blocked in case of repeated misuse by the user and 112 will be more accessible to people with disabilities.\nI also hope that the amendment regarding the establishment of an EU-wide early warning system will be adopted. This amendment does not require an agency in Brussels to be set up but the definition of common standards about the warning system to be done jointly by the relevant authorities of the Member States. Of course, the warning would be launched at the local level, but on the basis of common standards that would ensure that all potentially affected citizens of the EU could get and understand this message and act in a way that will save their lives.\nI am very sure that the telecom package will support the efforts of companies in improving their performance and investment in new technologies and at the same time will consolidate the consumer rights of European citizens.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Cristian Silviu Buşoi (ALDE). - Mr President, the telecom package is an important step forward in modernising and harmonising telecommunications in Europe.
