It is true that the rapporteur has done a magnificent job but I believe that we should not tackle the group of final amendments on the content of the Net here, in this directive, because in short what those amendments do is allow intermediate service providers to filter and block content on the Net and therefore, ultimately, consumers will lose their anonymity.\nLadies and gentlemen, this stance runs counter to Article 12 of the Electronic Commerce Directive, which already states that intermediate service providers must act as neutral intermediaries when they transmit electronic information.\nIn a State governed by the rule of law, we cannot do things to the Net which we would not do to other forms of communication.
