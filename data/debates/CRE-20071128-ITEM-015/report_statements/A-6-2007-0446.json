    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Recognises that, in order to succeed in the 21st century, Europe needs a wel- educated workforce and companies that are quick to seize opportunities that arise in a fast-moving world to increase productivity and enhance innovation;\n",
        "2.  Strongly endorses the conclusion that flexibility can be in the interests of the employee as well as the employer, and that this can be achieved through promoting adaptable and reliable contractual arrangements, including permanent contracts;\n",
        "3.  Emphasises, however, that flexicurity can be a policy strategy for the reform of the labour market and as such must be comprehensive by including all the existing facets of employment and social policy at both national and EU levels;\n",
        "4.  Realises that, in view of the changes in national social security systems and labour law , the Commission’s flexicurity options are too one-sidedly interpreted, since they take no account of the costs these measures involve; calls therefore for the Commission to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on these options; recalls that a flexicurity concept can be put into practice only in the long term;\n",
        "5.  Stresses that Europe's flexicurity strategy should take a closer look at the demands of the modern economy, what sort of workforce European firms need in order to succeed, and what are the main obstacles; stresses the need to take into consideration the specific nature of one-person-company, micro-enterprises and small enterprises of production of goods and services in European and national strategies; regrets that the Commission communication envisages flexicurity solely in the context of employment relationships; calls, therefore, for public policies linked to flexicurity to set up adequate conditions for creation of this kind of enterprises, for their development and their transfer;\n",
        "6.  Notes with deep concern that the Commission communication, while it refers to promoting gender equality, completely disregards the obligations and responsibilities set out in the Commission’s communication entitled 'A Roadmap for equality between women and men’; is critical of the fact that the EU's existing legislation on promoting gender equality has so far not achieved its objectives and that the income gap between the sexes, the absence of the necessary conditions for combining work and family life, and the lack of public child-care facilities, remain a central problem for European workers;\n",
        "7.  Believes that flexicurity strategies should facilitate recruitment and allow rapid responses to changing economic circumstances, flexicurity strategies should address these problems on the basis of transparent dialogue with social partners and other stakeholders, in accordance with national custom and practice, and on the basis of an impact assessment,  in which flexibility and security should be mutually reinforcing;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission to present a proposal for a limited set of synthesised qualitative indicators on the quality in work to complement the ones already agreed on within the framework of the Laeken 2001 reform of the Employment Guidelines; believes that the Commission should also rely upon on indicators on investment in peoples skills, on the level of precariousness and insecurity of jobs and contracts and on the transition between non-standard to permanent contracts in order to monitor the effectiveness of employment policies;\n",
        "9.        Opposes the creation of a new indicator on the 'strictness of employment protection legislation' as proposed by the Commission;\n",
        "10. Believes, however, that the biggest problems in the EU concern the supply of a skilled and adaptable workforce in competitive and innovative companies; stresses that the priority should be given to the creation of a flexible labour market by raising educational levels and expanding apprenticeship opportunities, training and retraining programmes; by implementing effective policies against discrimination and by breaking down barriers to the integration into the labour force of women, migrants, older or younger workers and other discriminated disadvantaged groups; by removing obstacles to occupational and geographic mobility; and by active labour market policies that support the transition from an old job to a new job; emphasises the decisive role of skilled and adaptable employees and new technologies in education and training and recalls the new forms of flexibility offered by the social partners' agreement on teleworking, part-time and fixed-term work; disagrees with the Commission’s distinction between insiders;\n",
        "11. Proposes, therefore, that the Council examine, in December 2007, the possibility of bringing forward the date for lifting the transitional measures obstructing the free movement of workers from eight new Member States to 1 January 2009; stresses that removing obstacles to mobility at the end of 2008 would send an important political message confirming the European Union’s commitment to doing its utmost to improve workers’ geographic and occupational mobility;\n",
        "12. Recalls that the freedom of movement for workers is one of the cornerstones of the European Union, which entails the obligation to address many issues regarding the compatibility of Member States’ social systems in order to ensure the full implementation of that freedom, in the best conditions for workers, to the benefit of European competitiveness and without jeopardising the achievements and balances of national social systems;\n",
        "13. Emphasises that in a globalised world, Member States must step up their efforts to treat all individuals equally in cross-border regions and that best practice requires the conclusion of fair bilateral agreements in the spirit of reciprocity between Member States, not least in the area of taxation;\n",
        "14. Notes that flexicurity should support and implement gender equality by promoting equal access to quality employment for women and men and by providing possibilities for reconciling work and family lives, particularly in view of the fact that three-quarters of new jobs created in the EU since 2000 are occupied by women, often already under flexible and less secure employment contracts;\n",
        "15. Proposes, therefore, that the European Council in December 2007 adopt a more balanced set of common principles of flexicurity, based on the creation of quality employment and the strengthening of the values of the European Social Model; considers that those principles should include: •  action for adaptable and reliable contractual arrangements and action against abusive labour practices especially in certain non-standard contracts; •  breaking down labour market segmentation by promoting employment security and improving job security; all workers shall have a core of rights regardless of their employment status; •  reconciliation of employment and family or private life, and the promotion of the concept of \"decent work\"; •  partnership between government (at local, regional and national level), social partners and civil society in managing change; •  gender equality and promoting equal opportunities for all; •  design and implementation of national pathways in close consultation with social partners, in accordance with national customs and practices; •  enhancement of companies' and workers' adaptability by strengthening transition security; •  the need for a skilled and adaptable labour force, therefore combining active labour market policies with investment in lifelong learning to enhance employability; •  a macro-economic framework for balanced and sustainable growth and more and better jobs;\n",
        "16. Recalls that the European Union has certain competences in the field of employment and social policy within the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality, and reminds the Commission and the Member States of their responsibility in guaranteeing certain rights at EU level; recalls that European legislation complements national labour market rules and is an important element when it comes to securing the rights of workers;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to give particular attention to the legal situation of the self-employed, small businesses and SMEs, which is characterised by a high level of economic dependence on their customers, and to consider together the most appropriate legislative means to raise their level of social protection;\n",
        "18. Regrets that the Council has failed to progress key employment dossiers which could help promote flexicurity as a positive concept;\n",
        "19. Calls also for a renewed fight against undeclared work and the black economy, which – although to a varying degree among the Member States – damages the economy, leaves workers unprotected, is detrimental to consumers, reduces tax revenues and leads to unfair competition between firms; calls on the Commission to combat undeclared work namely through more efficient coordination and administrative cooperation between national labour inspectorates and/or social partners; calls for intensive national coordination between public and private organisations involved and calls on Member States to use innovative methods based on indicators and benchmarks specific to the different business sectors in order to fight against fiscal erosion; calls upon the Commission to support the exchange of best practices between Member States in the fight against undeclared work;\n",
        "20. Is convinced that a climate of trust and dialogue can best be created through the involvement of social partners and other stakeholders in adjusting national policies and promoting collective agreements as part of a participative employment system where there is a high level of trust as a result of which a balance is guaranteed; stresses the need to address deficiencies in the coverage of collective bargaining and and the need to guarantee rights of association and representation of the two sides of industry; encourages the extension of collective bargaining and social dialogue according to national customs and practices - including cross-border dialogue and sectoral dialogue - so that they include training, work organisation and issues that are connected with anticipating change, restructuring and relocation;\n",
        "21. Recalls that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flexicurity and that each Member State should compose the elements of their flexicurity concept on the basis of its own situation and national traditions, within  the framework of the common principles;\n",
        "22. Stresses that all models of flexicurity should be based on common values that underpin the European Social Model; believes that flexibility and security requirements reinforce one another and that flexicurity allows firms and workers to adapt appropriately to the new international situation, with strong competition from the emerging economies, while maintaining a high level of social protection, social security and unemployment benefits, health and safety protection, active labour market policies and training/ lifelong learning opportunities;and a modern and transparent labour law;  moreover, highlights the success of recurrent and effective collective bargaining that strong and representative social partners can provide and also emphasises the need for broad welfare provisions and universal access to good quality services, such as childcare and care for other dependents; further stresses that guaranteeing these levels of social protection can support labour mobility and structural change by increasing the willingness to take risks; stresses that well-designed job protection systems provide business with the incentives to invest in workers’ skills and look for innovative and productive ways to restructure, thereby enhancing internal flexibility and adaptability of business;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to promote the development of the four policy components laid down in its communication: adaptable and reliable contractual arrangements;  comprehensive lifelong learning strategies; effective active labour market policies; modern social security systems and to look at flexicurity within the wider context of the European Social Model;\n",
        "24. Underlines the need to include educational and training measures in a wider flexicurity agenda and stresses that lifelong learning should address opportunity gaps among workers and must start at the initial education system;\n",
        "25. Emphasises that the fight against labour market segmentation should include the provision of a core of rights for all employees regardless of their specific employment status, which should include: equal treatment, workers' health and safety protection and provisions on working/rest time, freedom of association and representation, protection of unfair dismissal, collective bargaining, collective action, and emphasises the importance of access to training as well as the continued protection of acquired rights by covering periods of education and training, improved care opportunities, maintaining of essential social rights such as pension rights, training rights and right to unemployment benefits during changes in occupational situation, from one employment contract to another and from dependent to autonomous employment; recalls that core rights and labour law provide fair living and working conditions, adequate remuneration and social protection leading to a guarantee of minimum conditions for a decent life;\n",
        "26. Stresses the need to introduce policies that prevent worker exploitation through the accumulation of non-standard contracts that do not contain the same rights as full-time employment contracts; calls for every Community employment policy to continue to keep the traditional model of the open-ended employment contract, which forms the basis of the social security systems in Member States;\n",
        "27. Stresses the need to introduce preventive and accompanying measures to counteract the recurring accumulation of atypical contracts;\n",
        "28. Calls for the creation of comprehensive lifelong learning systems, also applicable to workers with non-standard contracts; calls on the Member States to focus strategies on areas of national weakness and make tailor-made investments in education and training and to ensure that the performance of public authorities and businesses improves; calls upon Member States to ensure the right and access to training for all;\n",
        "29. Calls for strengthening systems of industrial relations at EU and national level as a key to reach and implement flexicurity policies that are balanced and provide firms with the right kind of flexibility while ensuring that unfair competition at the expense of working conditions is ruled out;\n",
        "30. Stresses the need for companies to anticipate changes and their human resource requirements in order to plan internal training and retraining programmes for their employees;\n",
        "31. Recalls that, given this relationship, subcontractors, multiskilled workers, new workers and casual workers are workers subject to flexibility with high risk, as evidenced by their high accident rate;\n",
        "32. Considers that lifelong learning should address opportunity gaps among workers and must start in the early education system; takes the view that illiteracy and innumeracy must be fought, and the qualification levels of all school leavers must be improved, beginning in the early education system;\n",
        "33. Calls on the social partners and the public authorities in the Member States to promote and invest in lifelong learning; calls, moreover, on Member States to encourage companies to increase their investment in lifelong learning;\n",
        "34. Stresses the importance of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (2007-2013) in creating new and better companies that will promote a Europe of knowledge;\n",
        "35. Recognises that innovative forms of work organisations, such as learning organisations, multi-skilling and job rotation via training offered by employers, sectoral fund initiatives, regional development aid and active labour market policies which support an inclusive labour market;\n",
        "36. Is convinced of the importance of encouraging stable employment relationships by improving the organisation of work and the quality of relationships at the working place based on trust and dialogue; furthermore is convinced that employment law, modern forms of lifelong learning, sustainable social security systems and effective and efficient employment policy can contribute to a high level of confidence;\n",
        "37. Recalls the importance of effective, active labour-market policies, including advice and guidance, retraining and help with mobility in order to shorten transition periods between jobs and welfare systems that should actively motivate people to look for new job opportunities while also encouraging openness to change by mitigating income loss and providing opportunities for education;\n",
        "38. Stresses the need to facilitate mobility by developing pathways of upward mobility in order to make it easier for workers to shift to more secure, stable and high-skill employment and by promoting the recognition of skills and qualifications acquired during periods of  formal education and  non-formal and informal learning[19];\n",
        "39. Recalls the right of access to lifelong learning, and the recognition and transferability of formal, non-formal and informal education and competences, which are crucial factors in enabling individuals to be able to make transitions from job to job, and from unemployment or inactivity to employment, being elements that improve their employment chances;\n",
        "40. Calls on the Member States to introduce measures, in order to promote equal access to quality employment for women and men that comply with the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Communication on the Demographic Future of Europe; calls on Member States to close the existing gender pay;\n",
        "41. Notes that woman and men do not have the same starting point in the labour market, notably in terms of power balance, nor in the distribution of unpaid work;\n",
        "42. Underlines the importance of taking into consideration all aspects of flexibility, including flexibility of work organisation and working time, in particular through the use of new technologies; stresses the need for the social partners to negotiate working time arrangements better, to be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of employers and employees and to enable people to balance work and family and personal life;\n",
        "43. Calls on the Member States and social partners to reduce their policies of putting workers into early retirement and to introduce arrangements supporting the flexible retirement of older workers through part-time part-time employment, job-sharing and similar schemes that promote active ageing and may increase the integration of older workers into the labour market;\n",
        "44. Reminds the Member States that, in order to translate flexicurity into higher aggregate employment, there must be a supportive macro-economic environment and the strategy for flexicurity must include improved coordination of macro-economic policies and public spending in support of smart growth, with a shift in spending towards the Lisbon priorities;\n",
        "45. Reminds the Commission of the need to provide Parliament with the necessary time, and in any event no less than five months, to fulfil its consultative role;\n",
        "46. Considers that the common principles of flexicurity should be taken up as a cross-cutting issue and implemented by the Community institutions and the Member States within the framework of the Lisbon strategy; calls for a revision of the Employment Guidelines to allow aspects of flexicurity to be taken into account; and also for the inclusion of a specific chapter regarding the quality and strength of social dialogue in the annual Joint Employment Report; calls on the Commission and the Member States to better involve Parliament and  national parliaments, as well as the social partners, in the implementation and monitoring of the Open Method of Coordination, including the European Employment Strategy and the Employment Guidelines in order to optimise the efficiency of those policies; notes that the measures that fall within the Employment Guidelines, including flexicurity, are eligible for the European Social Fund (ESF) support, in particular training and active labour market measures, and calls on Member States to ensure that ESF programmes contribute to the implementation of the European Employment Strategy and to flexicurity strategies;\n",
        "47. Calls on the European Council and the Commission to set an ambitious social reform agenda both at EU and national level; moreover, calls on the institutions to draw up, together with Parliament, a vision for the future of social Europe; emphasises thus that, in order to strengthen growth and increase levels of employment and the quality of work, social rights and protection, which are firmly anchored in European tradition, must be ensured; stresses that Social Europe, together with ambitious national reforms, will offer, in this way, real added value for working people and citizens using all the tools at its disposal; believes that only an internal market which balances economic freedom with social rights can obtain the support of its citizens;\n",
        "48. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Social Protection Committee, the European Employment Committee, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the candidate countries.\n"
