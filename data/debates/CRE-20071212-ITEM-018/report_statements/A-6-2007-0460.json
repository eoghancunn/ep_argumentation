    "paragraphs": [
        "1.   Welcomes the establishment of an expert group on OREF, but regrets the fact that the Commission has not given equal priority to the question of FoHF; looks forward to receiving both the expert group report on OREF and the results of the Commission study on non-harmonised retail funds aiming at so as to enable the establishment of a single market for these products;\n",
        "2.   Calls on the Commission to examine future extension of Article 19(1) of the UCITS III Directive on eligible assets to OREF and FoHF bearing in mind that eligibility is already granted to hedge fund indices (HFI); highlights the need for a full impact assessment of the risks and benefits of such a change, thus paying particular attention to the protection of the UCITS brand; underlines that this shall not interrupt the currently ongoing revision of UCITS III;\n",
        "3.   Considers that, after taking into account the conclusions of the above mentioned expert group report and Commission study, consideration should be given to the establishment of a single market framework for OREF, FoHF and other non-harmonised retail funds as regulated products at EU-level underpinned by an impact assessment and taking full account of diversification, liquidity and valuation issues; underlines that this shall not interrupt the currently ongoing revision of UCITS III;\n",
        "4.   Calls for a harmonised framework for private placement at EU-level in order to enhance the single market integration, based on a thorough impact assessment; underlines that such regime must provide for the necessary legal certainty for its players but should not over-regulate and hence over-burden the private placement activities between sophisticated and well-informed players by too detailed or too prescriptive requirements; reiterates that national gold plating should not be possible;\n",
        "5.   Believes that a PPR should apply to all open-ended investment funds, including EU-regulated funds, nationally regulated funds as well as funds regulated in third countries; is, nevertheless, convinced that progress on the question of reciprocal market access where appropriate is essential; therefore calls on the Commission to negotiate such agreements with third countries, in particular with the United States, and requests the Commission to address this issue within the Transatlantic Economic Council;;\n",
        "6.   Is convinced that the definition of who is eligible to invest is crucial; suggests that already existing investor categories in MiFID and Prospectus Directive should be taken into account; supports a broad definition of sophisticated investor; however, highlights that, despite already existing legislation, there are several issues which still need to be addressed, such as the criteria of annual income as well as transfer restrictions forbidding the sophisticated investor, eligible for investment under such a PPR, to sell the product to retail investors;\n",
        "7.   Suggests that, as a first step, a waiver from the notification process for UCITS should be introduced in the 2008 UCITS III revision, this waiver being restricted to a small number of highly sophisticated investors such as the MiFID professional client;\n",
        "8.   Believes that, as a second step, the PPR should be extended to other products, to a more broadly defined type of sophisticated investor and should contain a general waiver from local marketing provisions; asks the Commission to determine by summer 2008 whether legislative measures are needed or CESR guidance is sufficient;\n",
        "9.   Is convinced that a European PPR framework should only apply to cross-border private placement and in this case override the existing national rules, it should, however, not replace national rules that apply to domestic private placement; favours, at least as a first step, a regime based on CESR guidance, but highlights that, in order to achieve more legal certainty, the need for European legislative measures should be examined;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to examine and reduce the tax barriers to the cross‑border placement of these products;\n",
        "11. Believes that the use of commission payments is an acceptable means of remuneration; points out, at the same time, that investor information including fee disclosure is crucial to empowering investors to take more informed decisions and to increase competition; welcomes the MiFID provisions on fee disclosure, but recalls that MiFID does not apply to all competing investment products; Competing products\n",
        "12. Believes that cost and fee disclosure requirements at the point of sale as well as information requirements on risk and performance on an ongoing basisshould not only apply to UCITS but equally to all competing products (i.e. certificates, notes, unit-linked life insurance); recognises, however, that it is not possible to provide for complete comparability between different types of investment products;\n",
        "13. Requests, in this context, a review of the legislative framework on the marketing, advise and sale of all retail investment products by the end of 2008 at the latest, in particular the upcoming Solvency II Directive, the Insurance Mediation Directive and the UCITS III Directive in order to achieve a level playing field and a coherent approach to investor protection; invites the Commission to ask the Level 3 Committees for technical advice in this area whilst taking into account the diversity of products and distribution channels;\n",
        "14. Asks the Commission to examine whether an industry-driven code of conduct might be helpful to increase fee transparency taking into account the positive and negative impact linked to the code of conduct in the post-trading sector;\n",
        "15. Welcomes the recommendation by CESR that a payment or non-monetary benefit provided to or made by a legal entity within the same group which only offers its own products (in-house funds) should be treated in exactly the same way as one provided to or made by any other legal entity in the context of open architecture firms (third party funds)[13];\n",
        "16. Notes that under Article 26 of the MiFID Implementing Directive, provisions on inducements apply to payments or non-monetary benefits made between two separate legal entities whereas products that are produced and distributed by the same legal entity do not fall within the scope of Article 26; calls on the Commission to examine the practical impact of Article 26 on the distribution of competing products and hence on open architecture;\n",
        "17. Acknowledges that tracking of commissions, in particular retrocession fees, is a time-consuming and costly process expected to intensify with increasingly open architecture; therefore calls on the industry to examine whether common standards across the European Union for appropriate position keeping are necessary such as standards for identifying distributors or providing data, such as data file formats, data transmission protocols, reporting frequency;\n",
        "18. Calls on CESR to report on the impact of Article 26 of the MiFID Implementing Directive  on current softing and bundling arrangements in 2008 and to examine, taking into account already existing as well as possible future self-regulatory initiatives by the industry, whether a common supervisory approach across the EU would benefit investors;\n",
        "19. Shares the concern expressed by the Commission in the Green Paper on the enhancement of the EU framework for investment funds (COM (2005) 314) regarding the emergence of guaranteed funds, misleadingly defined as such, when not backed by capital adequacy requirements; thus calls on the Commission to propose how the appropriate provisions, e.g. capital requirements, at the EU level for these funds can be achieved in order to ensure effective consumer protection; observes in this context that supervision requirements must be coherent and equally stringent both qualitatively, in terms of risk management standards, and quantitatively, as regards capital requirements; UCITS-MiFID interaction\n",
        "20. Welcomes the Commission's intention to solve possible conflicts of UCITS III and MiFID provisions on distribution, inducements and conduct of business rules in its vade-mecum; regrets, however, that the Commission has not published this guidance before the implementation of MiFID by the Member States; calls on the Commission to take account of Member State’s implementing laws and regulations, to clarify the legal status of the vade-mecum and its relation to CESR level 3 measures as well as to the Commission’s Questions and Answers on MiFID; Financial Literacy\n",
        "21. Points out that equivalent disclosure requirements of competing products at the point of sale on costs, risk and performance  help the investor to make an informed decision only if he has a sound knowledge and basic understanding of the functioning of different investment products; highlights, therefore, the need for financial literacy;\n",
        "22. Notices with regret that, in many jurisdictions, cross-border mergers remain subject to taxation while domestic mergers does not constitute taxable events; believes that since investors cannot influence such events and should be treated equally, cross-border and domestic mergers should be tax neutrally;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission to prepare a taxation of fund mergers directive following the principle of tax neutrality set out in Directives 90/434/EEC[14]and 2005/56/EC[15]in 2008; stresses that the objective is not to harmonise tax but to determine that domestic and cross-border mergers should be tax-neutral if the investor keeps its investment in the fund before and after the merger or withdraws its investment as a result of the intended merger, before the latter takes place;\n",
        "24. Believes that for practical reasons, tax neutrality should first be applied only to UCITS mergers and later to all other funds;\n",
        "25. Underlines the paramount importance of supervisory coordination of UCITS and non-UCITS products, and calls for continued efforts to exchange information and practical cooperation among the financial authorities;\n",
        "26. Regrets that the current design of investment policies has resulted in assets such as FoHF and OREF to remain outside of the eligibility scope, whilst fairly volatile and less transparent assets such as HFI being considered eligible by CESR;\n",
        "27. Believes that defining eligible assets and setting investment limits does not guarantee the quality of investment management and might even give retail investors a false sense of security; suggests therefore that a shift from a prescriptive to a principle-lead approach based on asset-liability management as a more sophisticated form of risk diversification should be considered in the medium term; underlines that the current revision of the UCITS III Directive should not be delayed by opening a fundamental discussion on such change at this stage; underlines the need to carefully analyse the impact of such a change on the performance of UCITS and the UCITS brand;\n",
        "28. Believes that introducing principle-based provisions on risk management systems at level 1 could help increase convergence in supervisory practices; thus expects the Commission, once the legislative work on the UCITS III revision is completed, to draw up a list of principle-based criteria for the use of risk management systems, bearing in mind that such systems should correspond to the individual risk profile of each fund; calls on the Commission to examine whether management companies should be obliged to explain the appropriateness of a certain system and whether a general requirement for pre-authorisation of risk management systems through the supervisor or a clearer role of the depositary in the investment activity oversight are necessary; calls on CESR to complete its work on the harmonisation of risk measurement systems;\n",
        "29. Considers it necessary, in order to bolster investor confidence, for all management companies established as joint stock companies and all distribution companies listed on a stock exchange to be subject to the national corporate governance regulations of their countries of registration and the provisions of Community law on corporate governance;\n",
        "30. Welcomes initiatives such as the EFAMA's Fund Processing Standardization Group , Eurofi and other initiatives at national level to increase the efficiency of fund processing; believes that the Commission should take action if the industry does not substantially progress in greater use of electronic and standardised fund processing by the end of 2009;\n",
        "31. Draws the attention to the difficulties of small and medium sized distributors and distributors with limited cross-border activity when switching to automated and standardised solutions;\n",
        "32. Notes the idea that standardised settlement deadlines could provide an incentive for more automation, simplify and clarify the processing of orders and reduce error rates[16];\n",
        "33. Notes the idea of setting up a standardised process to facilitate access to reliable and standardised data on cross-border funds, for example, if appropriate, supported by a European funds reference database on static data such as prospectus and processing data; highlights the need for oversight to guarantee that the data is up to date and reliable[17];\n",
        "34. Regrets that not all Member States allow the branches of EU credit institutions to act as depositary even though they are regulated at the EU level in accordance with EU financial services legislation; therefore, calls on the Commission to take the necessary legislative steps in the 2008 UCITS III revision to allow such credit institution branches to act as depositary and to clarify ways for an effective supervisory cooperation;\n",
        "35. Believes that harmonisation of a definition of depositary functions could contribute to better understanding and cooperation between regulators and ensure a consistent level of investor protection across Europe; recognises, however, the difficulty of overcoming national differences, in particular with regard to property law, terms of liability and insolvency protection rules; calls for further analysis of the legal barriers that would have to a be removed in order to achieve a harmonisation of depositary functions taking into account the already existing research on the different roles and responsibilities of depositaries across EU Member States;\n",
        "36. Highlights that a depositary passport should only be introduced after complete harmonisation of the role and responsibilities of the depositary are achieved; underlines that, before taking any decision, the interaction between a depositary passport, the management company passport, the fund and the regulator must be carefully examined;\n",
        "37. Requests that the Commission should examine the impact the wide use of highly complex products (i.e. derivatives, including credit derivatives and indices, including hedge fund indices) has on the effectiveness of the depositary's oversight function;\n",
        "38. Highlights the importance of ensuring the choice of implementing instruments on the basis of the content and objectives of the underlying Level 1 legislation; calls on the Commission to propose a legal basis at Level 1 for the use of both implementing directives and implementing regulations at Level 2; points out that the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny must be applied to all Level 2 measures;\n",
        "39. Points to the evidence showing that alternative investments such as hedge fund activities, while still inadequately understood in terms of their potential systemic impact, often result in higher market liquidity, dispersion of risk, in particular for traditional portfolios, and enhanced competition among market makers and intermediaries as well as in beneficial propriety research contributing to more information and more efficient pricing;\n",
        "40. Considers transparency and disclosure for investors and supervisors of utmost importance and expects the forthcoming IOSCO proposals to bring more clarity in this respect, urges the industry to agree on a code of conduct on portfolio valuation, risk management systems, transparency of fee structures and enhanced insight in investment strategies; asks the Commission to play a more active role in this discussion (e.g. within G8);\n",
        "41. Is convinced that access of retail investors to hedge funds should not be prohibited per se; points out, however, that given the often light regulation of hedge funds and their activities, retail access must be subject to strict conditions; highlights that clear criteria of eligibility of investors as well as regulation of the counterparties exposure are crucial; underlines, at the same time, that entities regulated by the MiFID are subject to suitability and appropriateness tests for distribution as provisions against misselling;\n",
        "42. Considers that financial stability issues need to be addressed at the global level via enhanced cooperation of supervisory authorities and central banks in international bodies such as IOSCO as well as through a regular dialogue between the governments and legislators; urges the Commission, the ECB and CESR to take an active role in stimulating this dialogue and proposing appropriate measures where necessary;\n",
        "43. Believes that hedge funds could help strengthening corporate governance practices by increasing the number of investors that make active and informed use of their shareholder rights; is, however, concerned that some hedge funds might boost their voting power at low costs through a variety of different mechanisms such as stock lending and borrowing; recognises that the latter is not only undertaken by hedge funds; suggests that the Commission should examine the feasibility and practicability of a provision that stipulates that where stock is held for the account of investors, a stock lending agreement must contain the right for the lender to promptly recall his shares; if no re-call takes place, the borrower should only be allowed to exercise the voting rights in accordance with instructions from the lender;\n",
        "44. Considers private equity as an important source of start-up, growth and restructuring capital, not only for large listed companies, but also for SMEs; however, is also aware of cases in which an increased level of indebtness brought considerable risks for companies and their employees when their management was no longer in the position to fulfil the repayment obligations;\n",
        "45. Stresses the importance of transparency towards the investors as well as towards supervisory authorities concerning fees and raising funds, especially when resulting in the leverage of the financial position of the company taken private, as well as their management objectives, in particular when restructuring large companies;\n",
        "46. Believes that regulation of the counterparties exposure is crucial as well as clear criteria of eligibility of investors to limit the retail investors' exposure to private equity;\n",
        "47. Recognises that employment effects often are a public concern; notices that available data contradict each other about their aggregate effect on the overall level of employment; invites the Commission to provide a better analysis;\n",
        "48. Is convinced that a more in-depth analysis is needed to better understand the impact of alternative investments such as hedge funds on the one hand and private equity on the other on financial stability, corporate governance, consumer choice and protection as well as employment; looks forward to examining these in the forthcoming parliamentary reports on hedge funds and private equity, based on the outcome of the studies commissioned in August 2007 (IP/A/ECON/IC/2007-23), suggests that these reports should include among others an examination of:-whether an industry-driven code of conduct is sufficient to enhance financial stability and investor protection or is there a need for more action by the legislator and supervisory authorities in terms of disclosure requirements through minimum reporting standards and regulation of relevant players;-whether there is an interest in or even a need for a European label for alternative investment instruments and if so, what could be the criteria to distinguish different asset classes that would be covered by such an EU framework;-under which conditions retail access to these asset classes could be permitted;\n",
        "49. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
