Such a practice is in breach of established international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights. From an Irish perspective, I am pleased that this report does not come up with any findings against the Irish Government, and this is in line with assurances given by the US authorities.\nI totally refute what my colleague Mr De Rossa said here today. It is unfounded to make allegations like that. Shannon Airport has been unreasonably treated in this regard and has been the loser, because it has now been decided by the American authorities not to use the airport for refuelling purposes, at a cost of EUR 10 million to the revenue of that airport. That is a result of the unfounded allegations that are being made by Mr De Rossa and others. They should establish the facts before they speak in such a manner.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Seán Ó Neachtain (UEN). – Mr President, I would like to say at the outset that I am fully against flights of rendition.
