{"speaker": "Simon Coveney (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Simon Coveney (PPE-DE). – Mr President, six months ago we set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of extraordinary rendition flights by the CIA and the involvement of EU countries. There have been many hours of hearings and debates in the committee since then and now we have our first interim report.\nAn honest assessment of the committee’s work to date would give a mixed picture, I believe. On the one hand there has been a certain level of frustration that new evidence and facts have not been forthcoming in most of our hearings. However, that said, I believe that the committee’s work has been useful in outlining and exposing all of the facts that are available to date, and certain facts are available. Even if we are reconsidering evidence already exposed by the Council of Europe, we need to be realistic. Our committee is not a court of law; we are politicians attempting to draw conclusions based on the balance of probability, given the evidence available.\nInvestigating the activities of the CIA or any secret services was never going to be a straightforward exercise. I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues, such as the possible existence of ‘black sites’ in EU Member States.\nIt is unfortunate that the debate on whether or not to support this report has been reduced by some to a polarising of positions, a pro- and anti-US stance, or even a left versus right divide. I am sorry that view has developed as it undermines the work of a well-intentioned committee and misses the point as regards what we are trying to achieve.\nIt is not anti-American to criticise extraordinary rendition or to push to establish facts, particularly if there are accusations against EU Member States in this regard. I would consider myself a hypocrite as a human rights spokesperson if I did not speak out against extraordinary rendition, even if it means criticising and asking awkward questions of governments that I consider to be our friends and allies. I include the US in that.\nNo approach to the necessary and difficult war on terrorism should be supported if it involves acting outside the rule of international law and the various standards that we, in Europe, stand up for. The interim report is not a perfect one, but the acceptance of PPE-DE amendments will add balance to a text worth supporting.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Simon Coveney (PPE-DE). – Mr President, six months ago we set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of extraordinary rendition flights by the CIA and the involvement of EU countries.
