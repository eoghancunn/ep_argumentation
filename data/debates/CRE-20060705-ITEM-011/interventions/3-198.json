{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, torture is always wrong and counterproductive. The US-instigated torture rendition programme is particularly wrong because it makes acceptable a new model in that in the past torture was mainly committed by dictatorial regimes. Now it is being promoted by democratic states. If the malpractice of torture is not challenged and reversed, then international laws designed to protect all humanity will be permanently degraded.\nClosing Guantánamo is not the answer because many prisoners transferred will be tortured elsewhere. Many of the prisoners transferred in November 2005 from the European black site prisons are now in unknown black hole prisons elsewhere.\nThe EU has a responsibility to ensure that these prisoners do not suffer further torture. The UN and the Red Cross should have compulsory access to all prisoners everywhere and the UN should have a daily-updated register of all prisoners in all UN member states. The EU and EU Member States should also provide more finance for the care of survivors of torture.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, torture is always wrong and counterproductive.
