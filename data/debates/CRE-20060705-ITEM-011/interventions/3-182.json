{"speaker": "Roger Helmer (NI). –", "english": "Roger Helmer (NI). – Mr President, we have had 50 hours of hearings and nothing to show for it. I sent a copy of Mr Fava’s report to a former staffer of mine, Sally McNamara, who is now the international relations director for a major Washington public policy institute, the American Legislative Exchange Council. I should like to quote her comments to you. She uses a vernacular word to describe the report and then says: ‘If I came up with this sort of report for my boss – devoid of fact and with a hefty dose of moral posturing – I reckon I would get fired’.\nI hope that our rapporteur will take note of these comments. His report is entirely speculative and circumstantial. It seeks to present unsubstantiated allegations as fact. Evidence of flights that may have been linked to the CIA is not evidence of rendition, still less evidence of mistreatment. The committee started from an a priori belief that the USA and the CIA are guilty, and merely sought with little success to substantiate its prejudices. It has not established evidence, it has merely provided a platform for anti-American bias.\nWhether we like it or not, the war against terror is real and it is now. The US has taken a lead in this war. It has spent a huge amount of blood and treasure in the defence of Western values. We in this House should show a little more gratitude and a little less criticism. I agree with Mr Piotrowski.
