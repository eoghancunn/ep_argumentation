We cannot, of course, ignore the fact that the USA is the central target of terrorism and we cannot underestimate the fact that the main task of combating terrorism falls on its shoulders.\nHowever, at the same time, we cannot forget that human rights are a cornerstone of modern European political philosophy. Therefore, despite our understanding of the USA’s role in combating terrorism, we cannot shut our eyes to certain activities that are contrary to European principles, values and rules. It is a fact that the CIA abused the understanding of certain countries. We condemn the practices of the CIA. We strongly condemn the CIA for the acts referred to by previous speakers and in Mr Fava’s report: extraordinary renditions, suspicious flights. We do the Americans no service if we leave the right of criticism of the CIA for acts committed in violation of human rights to those who are passionately anti-American.\nI agree with Mr Coelho, Chairman of the Temporary Committee, that in general Mr Fava’s report is good. However, it could be made more balanced if amendments stressing the other side of the coin were accepted.
