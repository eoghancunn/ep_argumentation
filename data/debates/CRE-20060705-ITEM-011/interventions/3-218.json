{"speaker": "Claude Moraes (PSE). –", "english": "Claude Moraes (PSE). – Mr President, as the final speaker from the Socialist Group, I would like to commend not only my previous colleagues and the rapporteur, but also the balanced approach we heard from Mr Coelho and the interesting comments by the Commissioner on greater transparency and reform of the intelligence services. It is for all those reasons that we must extend this report.\nPeople opposite have talked about circumstantial evidence. They must understand that we called on the testimony of 70 people and spent over 50 hours in this committee, not because we are anti-American — and I commend our rapporteur for never, ever, falling into that trap — but because we wanted to get to the truth.\nThe previous speaker spoke about 7/7 and London. There are one or two Members in this Chamber who represent the area affected by that bombing. The people who have written to us are not anti-American; they want anti-terrorism to be strengthened because human rights are being strengthened. That is the approach of my Socialist colleagues and of many Members across this House.\nWhy should we continue? We should continue because of the testimony of people like Maher Arar, whom I listened to and believed. Do I know that he is telling the final truth? No, I do not, because we are waiting for the Member States and for those who have not spoken to finally speak. That is why we need to extend this report and to extend the time we have.\nWhy else do we need to extend the time? We are telling European citizens that we will talk about the minute legislative detail, but are we also telling them that, when they are concerned about transparency and human rights and allegations they know very little about, we as a Parliament cannot deal with that?\nWe have to tell them we can deal with the issue credibly. We see it happening in the Council of Europe, and they should also see it happening in their Parliament. On our side of the House, we want to see the report extended, because we believe we have the right approach.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Claude Moraes (PSE). – Mr President, as the final speaker from the Socialist Group, I would like to commend not only my previous colleagues and the rapporteur, but also the balanced approach we heard from Mr Coelho and the interesting comments by the Commissioner on greater transparency and reform of the intelligence services.
