{"speaker": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). –", "english": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). – Mr President, I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism. Terrorists do not respect human life, they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights. We are all behind that fight, but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon.\nThe American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism. Unfortunately, the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations. The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists.\nI am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how, by making the wrong decisions, governments can strengthen terrorist organisations. As an example, the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions, but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again. The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully.\nThe interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe. The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations. If we are going to fight terrorism, we must all work together within the law.\nThe committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months. I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion.\nHowever, the American Government must implement new strategies if it is going to win the war against international terrorism. There are so many examples of how not to do it, but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Eoin Ryan (UEN). – Mr President, I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism.
