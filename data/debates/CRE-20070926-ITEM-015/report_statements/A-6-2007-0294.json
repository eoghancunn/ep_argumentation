    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Encourages the development of measures that complete the internal market for services;\n",
        "2.   Is convinced that a more uniform system of obligations for service providers is needed as the market in services becomes increasingly cross-border, in order to further facilitate the development of a seamless internal market for services;\n",
        "3.   Is aware that the Services Directive, to be transposed into national law in all Member States by 28 December 2009, should have a considerable impact on the cross-border provision of services, but notes that that Directive does not address the substantive obligations of service providers;\n",
        "4.   Believes that clarifying the legal system of obligations of service providers in the EU will bring more competition and more choice to consumers, and at the same time should not create unjustified obstacles to the free movement of services in the internal market;\n",
        "5.   Believes that the different laws, regulations and administrative practices in the Member States cause uncertainty and lack of transparency for both service providers and consumers and make the use of the EU's common resources more difficult, but also provide an opportunity for competition in consumer protection;\n",
        "6.   Regrets that the present mix of legislative instruments between rules on conflict of law and internal market instruments and the failure clearly to determine their interaction mean that neither the consumer nor the service provider is always able to know with clarity which legal regime is applicable to each aspect of their activities, that is to say, whether the civil law of the host or home country applies or whether the regulatory regime of the host or home country applies;\n",
        "7.   Is convinced that when consumers feel uncertain about the safety and quality of a service they tend to erect mental barriers to foreign suppliers, thus deterring them from making use of cross-border services, and that when a consumer has a negative experience, it frequently reflects unfairly on all foreign service providers;\n",
        "8.   Points out that when it comes to the performance of a service, consumers are not as well protected under the Community acquis as consumers who purchase goods;\n",
        "9.  Expresses its reservations, nonetheless, pending full implementation of the Services Directive, as regards far-reaching, new horizontal tools for the completion of the internal market for services;\n",
        "10. Is aware that services are often complex structures involving human interaction and discretion;\n",
        "11. Is convinced that not only consumers, but also and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), both as buyers and sellers of cross-border services, could benefit from added legal certainty, simplicity and a reduction in costs;\n",
        "12. Recalls that, as stated in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, cross-border services are provided in many different ways (such as selling online, travelling to another country for the service, or by the service provider visiting the customer's home country), which should be taken into consideration;\n",
        "13. Notes that there are several pending legislative initiatives aimed at ensuring legal certainty as regards the rights and especially the obligations of cross-border service providers, namely the proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) (COM(2005)0650), the proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) (COM(2003)0427) and the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis;\n",
        "14. Points out that Article 5 of the Rome I proposal is essential in order to determine whether the consumer protection legislation of the country of origin (of the service provider) or of the client (customer of the service) applies; stresses that it is important to await the outcome of the legislative procedure;\n",
        "15. Is convinced that the establishment of an internal market for services, the legal framework of which is based on the country of origin principle, depends on the relevant measures being clear from both a legal and a practical perspective;\n",
        "16.Calls on the Commission to bear in mind that, when it comes to the obligations of services providers, no difference should be made between public and private service providers,which should both be equally subject to the field of application of the directives on consumer protection;\n",
        "17. Recognises that, even though existing legislation in the EU, such as the Services Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive[5], does not contain any specific provisions aimed at regulating the cross-border liability of service providers, it may have an indirect effect on Member State legislation in this field;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission to monitor thoroughly the transposition and implementation of existing and upcoming horizontal and sectoral legislation relating to the liability of cross-border service providers;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to examine measures, such as the introduction of standards at EU level, as a means of promoting the safety of services and of guaranteeing consumers' rights relating to cross-border services provided by Member States;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to draw up a voluntary code of conduct in which service providers could participate in order to gain greater trust from consumers and with a quality certification mechanism and an inbuilt dispute settlement system involving appropriate bodies in order to assist in simplified dispute resolution;\n",
        "21. Recognises that liability regimes for service providers exist, albeit to varying degrees, in all Member States, but believes that in the interests of clarity and so as to create consumer confidence that there needs to be some convergence, especially in key cross-border sectors; believes also that there is a need for greater co-operation between national regulatory bodies and professional organisations, where appropriate;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission, whilst continuing work on a sectoral basis in key areas, to submit, within 12 months, a work programme for an appropriate assessment of the impact of existing and upcoming legislation in the internal market on the obligations of cross-border service providers and the need for a possible broad horizontal instrument to align the rules on cross-border service provision in order to provide a high level of consumer protection;\n",
        "23. Considers that such an assessment should examine a possible broad instrument which should at least contain basic general rules requiring adequate information on pricing, contract terms and remedies in the case of defective or delayed services;\n",
        "24. Calls on the Commission to define clearly the interaction between private international law instruments and internal market instruments with a view to leaving no doubt as to when home or host country legislation or regulation applies and so, as far as possible, to leave no gaps in the liability regime applicable to service providers;\n",
        "25. Considers that the Commission should take into account the impact of any initiative on SMEs;\n",
        "26. Calls on all those Commission Directorates General involved in legislation for the service sector to participate in the continuing work on the Common Frame of Reference with a view to including sections on service contracts, especially in those areas where there is already, or there is likely to be, cross-border activity, such as, by way of example only, financial services and the health sector;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to further develop, resource and promote the work of the ECC-Net and FIN-NET and, in the event that alternative dispute resolution systems remain unavailable in key service sectors in Members States, to consider at least a recommendation on that subject; o o     o\n",
        "28. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.\n"
