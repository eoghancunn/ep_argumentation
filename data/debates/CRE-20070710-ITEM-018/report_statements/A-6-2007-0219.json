    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Recalls that – given growing traffic volumes, rising emissions and limited energy resources, as well as thousands of road accident victims – reviving rail transport is a key objective of EU transport policy, and calls on the Commission to take account of this fact in implementing the first rail package;\n",
        "2.  Considers that the “Eurovignette 2” directive is an initial step towards fair intermodal competition: fair competition is not possible when the levying of charges is mandatory throughout the EU for all trains on all rail routes, while road tolls in the EU have an upper limit, are charged only on a voluntary basis without internalisation of external costs, mostly only on motorways and only for lorries; calls, therefore, on the Commission to submit a directive by 2008 (cf. Article 1(9) of Directive 2006/38/EC) in which the Eurovignette is adjusted in line with the rail route pricing system, tolls are made mandatory for all lorries over 3.5. tonnes on all roads in the EU without loopholes, and external costs are internalised;\n",
        "3.  Calls on the Commission to translate the principles of the transport protocols of the agreement with Switzerland, and of the Alpine Convention, into corresponding measures for the shift to rail of trans-Alpine freight transport;\n",
        "4.  Considers that ultra-long lorries (“Gigaliners”) further undermine the competitive position of the railways; fears that the licensing of such lorries throughout Europe would ruin single wagonload traffic and combined transport, and therefore rejects any such measure;\n",
        "5.  Notes that competition between rail and air transport is distorted; considers that exemption from kerosene tax and from VAT on international air tickets should be placed on the agenda as a matter of urgency at international and EU level;\n",
        "6.  Considers it incompatible with the objective of European transport policy for Member States to charge high route prices on the rail freight network, while at the same charging no tolls for lorries on the roads;\n",
        "7.  Emphasises that the lack of network interoperability is still the main obstacle to creation of an integrated European railway area, and welcomes the Commission’s decision to put forward a new initiative on this aspect; considers that liberalisation should have gone hand-in-hand with the progress on interoperability and regrets that the two processes have proceeded at very different speeds; points out that opening up the networks to competition will bear fruit only if there is a real integrated trans-European network; calls for this question to be treated as a priority in future;\n",
        "8.  Calls on the Commission to modernise and develop intermodal infrastructures, particularly junctions with port infrastructures; Conditions for intramodal competition\n",
        "9.  Stresses that the interoperability of rail traffic must be further improved so as to enhance the competitiveness of the railways; calls in this connection for ERTMS to be installed rapidly and without gaps on the six corridors on which the EU, through its coordinator Karel Vinck, has reached agreement with the railway undertakings and the Member States (A: Rotterdam-Genoa; B: Naples-Berlin-Stockholm; C: Antwerp-Basle/Lyon; D: Seville-Lyon-Turin-Trieste-Ljubljana; E: Dresden-Prague-Brno-Vienna-Budapest; F: Duisburg-Berlin-Warsaw);\n",
        "10. Urges the Commission to extend the good example set by state aid for rolling stock, made possible in connection with the installation/improvement of ERTMS in trains, to noise reduction in goods trucks, as this will enable savings to be made in infrastructure investments;\n",
        "11. Recognises that the option of giving preference to passenger rail transport at the expense of rail freight transport through very high route pricing is a factor which negatively affects the competitiveness of rail freight transport; notes that such action by rail undertakings is a direct result of the under-funding of these undertakings by the Member States; calls, therefore, on the Commission to take all legal steps to prevent this practice;\n",
        "12. Calls on the Commission to take action against subsidy practice whereby EU transport aid flows into Member States which use it almost exclusively to fund their road networks while neglecting the railways; considers that, in the event of co-financing, at least 40% of the appropriations should be allocated to the railways;\n",
        "13. Notes that the three Baltic Member states have implemented EU legislation and are liberalising their markets while this is not the case in their neighbouring country, Russia. This special situation should have been acknowledged in the European Commission report;\n",
        "14. Supports the Commission in its efforts to promote the trans-European rail freight network still further and expects support to be given in particular to the priority Trans-European Network projects;\n",
        "15. Requests the Commission to put forward recommendations for the sustainable reform of the railways’ financial structure (see Article 9 of Directive 91/440);\n",
        "16. Calls on the Commission to draw up a plan for promoting the restoration of rail connections to industrial undertakings and ensuring that links are no longer destroyed;\n",
        "17. Calls on the Commission to look into the possibility of introducing better transparency and predictability of route prices, establishing the principle of a minimum of harmonisation of prices on international corridors which are the subject of investment by railway undertakings to improve interoperability; Regulation of the separation between network and operation\n",
        "18. Considers the separation of railway infrastructure and operation to be a key issue of rail policy, given the central role of infrastructure operators for the rail industry, and in this connection regards it as absolutely essential to create an independent and transparent regulating body with adequate funding;\n",
        "19. Considers both the separation and the integration models to be compatible with Community law, provided that the independence of the essential functions is safeguarded in accordance with Directive 2001/14/EC; considers that this is not fully the case, as is shown by the numerous complaints by undertakings entering the market which are in competition with old-established state railway undertakings; their complaints include or have included the following:\n",
        "20. Notes that the entry into the market of new service providers in the single wagonload traffic sector is dependent on the efficient operation of marshalling yards; regards it as necessary for marshalling yards to be neutrally operated in order to ensure that all undertakings are dealt with without discrimination, and calls on the Commission to consider amending EU law to this effect;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to adapt the rail systems currently confined within national borders in such a way that each rail undertaking which meets the necessary legal and technical requirements in a Member State is permitted to operate across the whole European network (cross-acceptance), thus promoting not only trans-European but also regional cross-border traffic; this will also eliminate the advantages of road and air transport where these have existed for many years;\n",
        "22. Calls on the Commission to initiate legal proceedings without delay against those Member States which have not implemented the first and/or second railway package by the specified date;\n",
        "23. Notes that absolute priority must be given to the full implementation of the First Railway Package, including the test criteria laid down by the Commission in the Annexes to its report on the implementation of the First Railway Package;\n",
        "24. The railways’ share of the freight market has been stabilizing since 2001 in EU-25 and the best performance, disregarding the Baltic States which benefit from their very special geographical location and the kind of goods transported, can be seen in Member States which were first to start reforming their railway industry in anticipation of the Community Directives and the opening up of the market;\n",
        "25. Notes that capacity shortages on the railways in Europe have a negative effect on the operation of the railways in relation to other modes of transport; calls on the Commission, before the end of 2007, to study the effects of Articles 22, 25 and 26 of Directive 2001/14/EC with reference to the capacity analysis and capacity enhancement plan prescribed there in the event of infrastructure congestion;\n",
        "26. Developing today the competitiveness of the sector through market opening means supporting future investment, and thereby ensuring the growth and employment which the Lisbon Strategy aims at. In addition, by contributing to the development of environmentally friendly transport, the Community deliberately opts for the development of sustainable transport;\n",
        "27. Stresses the importance of an independent role for railway undertakings, as enshrined, inter alia, in Article 5 of Directive 91/440/EEC with regard to technical, organisational and financial management, and notes the positive effects of such a role on the development of rail as a mode of transport;\n",
        "28. Underlines the importance of the European social dialogue in preventing the process of liberalisation from clearing the way for social dumping;\n",
        "29. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
