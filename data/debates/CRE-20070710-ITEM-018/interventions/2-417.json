{"speaker": "Jacques Barrot,", "english": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Mr President, I thank each of the speakers for the wise observations they have shared with me.\nNonetheless, I shall say a few words on a point which, to my surprise, has not really received the attention of the European Parliament. It is about the separation between the management of the rail infrastructure and the provision of transport services. It is, in fact, this separation which makes it possible to give to competition its full scope. We have to ensure non-discriminatory access to facilitate the entry into the market of new entrants. That is a very important point.\nI should like to answer some questions. In talking about co-modality, our goal was simply to explain that rail transport, which is indisputably the best solution over long distances, must be able to be completed by local transport which, in certain cases, can only be provided, as Mr Jarzembowski has said, by road. Therefore, the idea is not to take something away from rail but on the contrary to allow it to have its rightful place. Oh yes, it is very clear! I am speaking in particular to Mr Navarro: one must make no mistake about the intention. The intention is really to make a success of this modal shift, which is very important to me, as it is to you. I must say also that what we are doing, be it about financing infrastructures across trans-European networks or interoperability, which the European Rail Traffic Management System and European Train Control System is going to make possible for us, or the cross-acceptance of rolling stock or the promotion of freight traffic on European corridors, all these achievements seek to obtain the most substantial modal shift possible. I think that, on this point, our approach presents no ambiguity.\nMrs Griesbeck, I would like to confirm the Commission’s intention to present guidelines on state aid in the rail sector before the end of the year. I should also like to confirm to Mr Jarzembowski that the communication on the noise of carriages is planned for the autumn of this year. I cannot say any more about it for the time being; we are in the process of working on it.\nThere are certainly other questions which deserve an answer. I would like you to know, in any case, that I really have listened with close attention to all that has been said by each of you. I consider for my part that the work carried out by Mr Cramer and his committee is enlightening for the Commission. I should like to repeat again that what we want are fair intermodal and intramodal conditions of competition which make it possible effectively to develop this modal shift to which, I repeat again once more, we are very committed, particularly for reasons of environment and relief of congestion on our road network.\nFor all the reasons that you can imagine, we have more need than ever of the railway. I must say that, each day, I work towards this with much determination. I have moreover realised that, with the opening of Betuwe in the Netherlands, a willingness is really establishing itself in Europe with a view to giving rail its rightful place; and indeed, if in certain cases, problems of charging arise, it is incumbent upon the Member States to accept their responsibilities. This modal shift is a real priority cause in Europe. It is necessary also that governments accept making it their priority.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission .
