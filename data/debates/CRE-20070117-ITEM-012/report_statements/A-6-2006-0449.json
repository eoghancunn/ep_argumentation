    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Calls for a higher level of political commitment in all Member States and EU institutions to road safety across the European Union by all Member States, by regional and local authorities and EU institutions, and by industry, organisations and individuals;\n",
        "2.  Considers that only an integrated systems approach involving all road users and stakeholders, on the basis of efforts to promote public transport and more effective lawmaking in the Member States, combined with adequate monitoring of road users in the Member States (driving licence checks, breathanalyser tests, etc.),can lead to significant and sustainable reductions in the number of serious road accidents;\n",
        "3.  Recalls that the ambitious objectives that the Union has set out cannot be attained without taking into account the essential character of education and enforcement of present legislation in Member States; thus urges the Member States to further stress and generalise their information policies and public awareness to road safety for all users, of all ages; also calls on the Member States to fully apply, without exception, the present legislation the respect of which by users will allow a great improvement in road safety;\n",
        "4.  Welcomes the Commission's two recent proposals for directives on road infrastructure safety management - which could reduce fatalities by 12 to 16% - and the use of blind-spot mirrors;\n",
        "5.  Calls on the Commission to submit as soon as possible its promised proposals such as cross-border enforcement, daytime-running lights, application of the existing measures and regulations in the field of road safety the use of rear reflector strips to indicate the outlines of lorries and the use of installed and retro-fitted blind-spot mirrors  and/or new systems to monitor the blind spot;\n",
        "6.  Considers it particularly important, with a view to combating cross-border driving offences, that it should be possible to enforce the law on speeding, failure to wear a seat belt and drink-driving in an effective manner so that such significant penalties are imposed irrespective of whether the offence is committed in the offender's own country or in another Member State;\n",
        "7.  Reminds the Commission of its intention to consider the provision of user-friendly and up-to-date information about the traffic signing systems used in the Member States via an internet website available in all official EU languages;\n",
        "8.  Emphasises the need to harmonise road traffic rules and signs, since, for example, differing priority rules at roundabouts can cause accidents;\n",
        "9.  Since unclear or inconsistent road signs cause unnecessary risks for the road safety and considering the provisions of the Vienna Convention, calls on the Commission to come up with a study on harmonization of road signs in Europe as a means to improve road safety;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission, considering the high number of accidents and deaths at road work zones, to develop common guidelines on the requirements for safe road work zones based on identification and exchange of best practices;\n",
        "11. Considers that the Commission should promote EU-funded twinning projects between new and old Member States with a view to speeding up positive developments in road safety;\n",
        "12. Considers that the Commission should encourage the presence of participants from both ‘new’ and ‘old’ Member States in its working parties;\n",
        "13. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the European Road Safety Charter;\n",
        "14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to actively compare and co-ordinate the results achieved in the Member States in the field of road safety so that, by following best practice, they can pass on the benefits of good experience to all Member States and thus hasten positive developments in this area;\n",
        "15. Calls upon the Commission to recognise the importance of independent pan-European benchmarking assessment programmes in supporting a more uniform application of EU legislation affecting road safety, which stimulates competition among stakeholders responsible for ensuring a safe road environment (i.e. EuroTAP, EuroNCAP);\n",
        "16. Calls on the Member States to consider introducinga zero alcohol limit for newdrivers and professional commercial vehicle and bus drivers involved in passenger transport and, for example, for transport of hazardous goods;\n",
        "17. Draws attention to the possibility of laying down minimum active and passive security requirements for all vehicles and harmonising the technical road safety rules throughout the Union;\n",
        "18. Considers that driving under the influence of drugs is a serious problem which needs to be combated and that the Member States and the Commission should invest more resources in researching and combating such offences;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Member States to make the use of hands-free mobile telephone systems compulsory for car drivers and professional bus and commercial-vehicle drivers;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up their efforts to ensure that the use of seat belts is increased in all vehicles, especially buses;\n",
        "21. Calls on the Commission to impose a general ban on overtaking for vehicles weighing in excess of 12 tonnes on one- and two-lane roads;\n",
        "22. Invites the Commission to recommend the Member States to establish and maintain adequate rest facilities which respond to the criteria of the European social partners in order to ensure safer infrastructure facilities for break driving;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to create incentives for purchasers or leasers of fleets of vehicles to buy or lease the best vehicles the market has to offer in terms of safety and environmental impact and that car producers develop vehicles that are safer and environmentally more efficient;\n",
        "24. Is convinced that insurance companies can play a crucial role in upholding road safety legislation and labour legislation in the road transport sector, e.g. by setting differential premiums;\n",
        "25. Calls on the Member States to ensure that incentives are not confined to the latest technologies for reducing emissions, but also cover significant safety features (emergency brake assistants, lane departure warning systems, adaptive cruise control systems, shock absorber control systems, etc.);\n",
        "26. Calls on the Commission to investigate the effects of tiredness and exhaustion on drivers so as to reduce the frequency of accidents they cause, both among private motorists and – from a health and safety at work perspective – for those who use vehicles in their work;\n",
        "27. Calls on the Commission to start an information campaign at a European level against tiredness on drivers so as to promote, as already done in several Member States, the need for the drivers to stop driving each two hours in any journey;\n",
        "28. Is of the view that out of the huge selection of technologies the following solutions should receive particular attention: seat belt reminders and advanced restraint systems, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), speed limitation systems, alcohol interlocks, predictive safety systems (emergency brake assistant, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning system, ultrasound blind-spot monitor, shock absorber control system) and eCall;\n",
        "29. Calls on the Member States to sign the joint statement of intent concerning the eCall system by June 2007;\n",
        "30. Considers that ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) should be adapted for older drivers;\n",
        "31. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to encourage EuroNCAP to introduce tests for whiplash protection and for active technical systems such as ESP/ESCemergency braking, driver support (e.g. alcohol interlocks), adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning;\n",
        "32. Calls on the Commission to explicitly include the safety of motorcyclists in infrastructure guidelines, especially regarding motorcycle friendly crash barriers on European roads;\n",
        "33. Considers that one important measure the Commission should examine is the creation of a common minimum standard for driving instructors with test and certification;\n",
        "34. Calls on the  Member States to draw up an action plan for training and education in road safety, to be applied throughout the school curriculum (from age 3 to 18) and in all schools in the Union; also advocates the drawing-up of standards for the training and security measures that are needed if there is to be guided practice for intending drivers from age 16;\n",
