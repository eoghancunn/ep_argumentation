{"speaker": "Gary Titley,", "english": "Gary Titley, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I congratulate Ewa Hedkvist Pedersen on this last report for the European Parliament. It is an excellent report, although it has been rather bombarded by some weird and wonderful amendments.\nWe do not need elaborate schemes. We simply need safer roads, safer drivers and safer vehicles and, most importantly, we need action and enforcement. When I was Parliament’s rapporteur on eCall, for example, the industry had made progress but the governments were not making progress. That is why I say we need action.\nHowever, I have two reservations. Firstly, on the issue of daytime running lights, I do not believe that there will be any overall net gain in road safety because, as cars become visible, other users, particularly motorcyclists, become less visible. Daytime running lights will mean more fuel usage, and that is bad from a climate change point of view. It is a matter of subsidiarity. The situation in Spain during the day is not the same as the situation in Sweden. I think this should be left to Member States.\nSecondly, I do not believe in harmonised blood alcohol limits, simply because you can have all the standards in the world, but they are no use unless you have enforcement. We in the UK have perhaps a more generous blood alcohol limit, but we have the lowest level of drink driving. Why? Because enforcement is rigid and the penalties are very severe. That is where we should be putting the emphasis.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Gary Titley, on behalf of the PSE Group . – Mr President, I congratulate Ewa Hedkvist Pedersen on this last report for the European Parliament.
