{"speaker": "Jacques Barrot,", "english": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission . (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this very rich debate deserves many replies. I shall try to stick to the fundamental points. I would like to thank Mrs Hedkvist Petersen once again. I would also remind her that exchanges of experiences will from now on be normal practice and that manufacturers have finally understood that safety could become a sales factor: I am talking about the Euro NCAP programme. The commitment of manufacturers in the European Road Safety Charter has specifically focused on seat belt reminders and electronic stability control for heavy goods vehicles.\nI shall now reply briefly to the group speakers. Mr Koch and Mr Titley emphasised respect for rules, control and penalties. They are absolutely right: those are the key priorities. Mr Titley and a number of other Members mentioned daytime running lights. When we consulted the Member States, it was clear that no decision had been taken. It is true that daytime running lights are in force according to different procedures. Those who are making them obligatory appear to be relatively satisfied, but we have not taken any decision in that field. We will probably have to wait for dedicated daytime running lights.\nMr Degutis, several Member States that joined in 2004 are now making progress, and their efforts are bearing fruit, as you quite rightly pointed out. Mr Ó Neachtain, we are working on cross-border enforcement. I very much hope that, by the end of the year, we will have drawn up a system enabling us to crack down on offences committed in another Member State. Mr Meijer mentioned small-scale solutions. In fact, competence is shared between Europe, the States and the regions. Mrs Sinnott talked about the safety of infrastructures. That was the subject of the Commission’s last proposal.\nI cannot reply to all of the speakers. I believe that they have all expressed support for our integrated approach, which is based upon three factors: the behaviour of drivers, the safety of vehicles and the quality of infrastructures. The speeches have confirmed that our two institutions take a similar view.\nOn ending this debate, I would like to thank everybody who has spoken and point out how much I am counting on Parliament to support the legislative proposals being discussed: the implementation of mirrors eliminating the blind spot for existing heavy goods vehicles, the management of infrastructures and, shortly, the cross-border prosecution of offences. I would like to thank Parliament for its willingness to pioneer such activities. Sometimes the Member States are more reticent. I have the impression that Parliament is entirely convinced that we must act with determination if we want to make progress on this important matter of road safety.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission .
