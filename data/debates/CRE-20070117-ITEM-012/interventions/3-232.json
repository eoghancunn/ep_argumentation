{"speaker": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). –", "english": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). – Thank you, Madam President, and congratulations on your election.\nPolice cooperation on cross-border enforcement of traffic offences, accounting for 25 % of cases in some Member States, either is not implemented properly or has to be carried out through complex bilateral agreements. In border areas in Ireland, for example, motorists who are caught speeding on one side of the border go unpunished if their vehicles are registered on the other side. Yet neither Ireland nor the UK applies the 1998 European Convention on driving disqualifications, despite being enacted in domestic legislation in both jurisdictions.\nThe Commission should, I believe, come forward urgently with proposals for a Europe-wide enforcement of road traffic penalties, mutual recognition of penalty points, driver disqualifications and training and rehabilitation. I would also like to see a common European blood alcohol limit. My own view is that it should be no more than 50 mg.\nI want to refer in passing to a comment made by one of my colleagues here about trees. I would strongly oppose any proposal that trees should be cut down in order to facilitate speeding, drugged and careless drivers. I also support Mrs Sinnott in her view in relation to lay-bys for truck drivers, which should also be available for car drivers. I had the recent experience of a two-hour journey on the road from Wexford to Dublin in Ireland, a road recently upgraded using substantial amounts of EU funds, and there was not a single lay-by in that two-hour journey on either side of the road. I think that is quite appalling.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Proinsias De Rossa (PSE). – Thank you, Madam President, and congratulations on your election.\nPolice cooperation on cross-border enforcement of traffic offences, accounting for 25 % of cases in some Member States, either is not implemented properly or has to be carried out through complex bilateral agreements.
