        "1.Welcomes the Commission's intention, outlined in the State aid reform roadmap, to modernise the practices and procedures regarding State aid;\n",
        "2.Agrees with the Commission that there is a real need for a comprehensive reform of State aid policy;\n",
        "3.Notes that State aid policy is an integral part of competition policy and that State aid control reflects the need to maintain a level playing field for all undertakings carrying out activities in the single European market; stresses, however, that, in accordance with Article 87 of the Treaty, State aid can also help in achieving other EU objectives, in particular those referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty;\n",
        "4.Notes that Articles 86 and 87 of the Treaty expressly authorises certain exceptions to the general prohibition of State aid, when the aid regimes proposed have clearly defined beneficial effects for the population and the environment and the aid does not harm the general activities of the EU; considers it essential, therefore, that when assessing whether State aid is compatible with the Treaty, the right balance is struck between the negative effects of State aid on competition and its positive effects on the common Community interest;\n",
        "5.Stresses that, in order to remove legal uncertainty, the Commission’s decisions should be closely in line with relevant judgments of the Court of Justice; considers that the State Aid Action Plan should be accompanied, where necessary, by legislative initiatives making it possible to reform State aid along the lines called for by the EU and to enhance legal certainty;\n",
        "6.Suggests that the Commission should publish, as consistently as possible, interpretative guidelines on Court of Justice judgments on State aid rules, whether these are based on Treaty provisions or on provisions contained in secondary legislation;\n",
        "7.Stresses the need to draw the consequences both of the unsuccessful grant of State aid in the past and of those cases in which this has proved an effective instrument for achieving the objectives pursued; stresses that State aid that distorts competition should be abolished;\n",
        "8.Expresses the wish that the Commission publish an annual report addressed to Parliament and the Council on State aid granted in the Member States;\n",
        "9.Asks the Commission in this context to apply stringent reporting rules, covering Member State as well as beneficiaries; asks the Commission, furthermore, to modify the State Aid Scoreboard with this in mind;\n",
        "10.Considers that in today’s global economy it is essential that rules laid down at EU level should take into account the conditions of international competition;\n",
        "11.Welcomes the Commission's statement in the State aid action plan that the key objectives of the Community include a high level of employment, sustainable growth and economic and social cohesion;\n",
        "12.Welcomes the Commission’s aim of refining its economic approachto State aid proceedings and focusing its resources on cases that are likely to create the most serious distortions to competition and trade;\n",
        "13.Calls for the Commission's economic approach to be defined strictly, in order to increase legal certainty for the parties involved; considers, therefore, that the Commission's economic analysis should be based on defined criteria derived from the procedures in force in other areas of competition law, while ensuring that the procedures are not too cumbersome;\n",
        "14.Urges the Commission to subject both criteria for assessing illegal aid, as provided in Article 87(1) of the Treaty - the distortion or threat of distortion of competition on the one hand and the effects on trade between Member States on the other -  to economic analysis in all its decisions; asks the Commission to confirm and specify its approach for both criteria in specific guidelines;\n",
        "15.Suggests that the Commission provide both a more detailed definition of the concept of 'market failure' including an explanation of when the concept is applicable and a coherent methodology; insists that the concept should be workable, allowing Member States and beneficiaries to apply and benefit from it in practice; insists that the new concept must also be subject to shorter procedures; asks the Commission to clarify the limits of the concept of market failure and its interaction with the constituent elements of the prohibition of State aid in Article 87 of the Treaty;\n",
        "16.Notes the initiative by Commission Vice President Siim Kallas to introduce more transparency in the procedure for granting agricultural subsidies, which would require Member States to publish the identity of beneficiaries and the amount of aid granted on the Internet, and would recommend the scheme to be extended to all State subsidies; recommends Member States to require companies to publish details of subsidies received in order to enable shareholders to better evaluate the real performance of the company, especially in case state subsidies might be cut;\n",
        "17.Warns against the potentially harmful role of State aid in motivating the relocation of potential beneficiary undertakings between Member States, due to \"subsidy-shopping\" by enterprises, without any real benefit in respect of the common goals of the EU;\n",
        "18.Stresses the high importance of innovation and R&D to the future competitiveness of the EU in a global economy;\n",
        "19.Stresses that State aid for R&D should be evaluated in the light of the Lisbon objectives and that such aid can enable Member States both to target market failures and to draw up measures giving industry an incentive to invest more in R&D; underlines, nevertheless, that aid for R&D must not give rise to aid that is distorts competition, especially by favouring established market players; stresses in this context the need to overcome regulatory and fiscal barriers in Member States that hamper the development of young and innovative businesses;\n",
        "20.Is very supportive of State aid flexibility concerning the creation and promotion of innovative ideas in public sector research bodies and universities, as well as clear and simple rules on how to transfer such ideas and expertise to businesses; in this regard, supports the generation of further innovation through public-private collaboration and partnerships;\n",
        "21.Stresses the principle that aid for R&D should not favour individual undertakings; urges the Commission to aim aid for R&D at innovation clusters;\n",
        "22.Supports the Commission’s intention to make the State aid system more flexible with a view to supporting innovation processes in a way that is proportionate to their remoteness from the market;\n",
        "23.Considers that, due to regulatory insufficiencies and incentive-poor tax systems in some Member States, the provision of risk capital, in particular to small businesses, is not optimal; welcomes, therefore, the revision of the Commission communication on State aid and risk capital[10];\n",
        "24.Underlines the need to foster the development of start-ups and young, innovative SMEs, inter alia through the use of appropriate tax incentives,;\n",
        "25.Stresses the need for less burdensome, faster approval procedures; favours in this context block exemptions for small-scale aid for SMEs;\n",
        "26.Calls on the Commission finally to ensure legal clarity as regards aid for services of general economic interest;\n",
        "27.Considers that the element of overcompensation is the most fundamental criterion and that, therefore, the financing of services of general economic interest constitutes State aid only in those cases where the criterion of justifiable compensation is not and cannot be shown to be fulfilled;\n",
        "28.Regrets that there are still great differences between how the Commission intends to interpret the test in the Court of Justice'sAltmarkjudgment in practice; calls on the Commission to issue a clear and precise interpretative communication on the fourth criterion set out in theAltmarkjudgment;\n",
        "29.Asks the Commission, given the increasing importance of public-private partnerships for building infrastructures in less-developed regions, to pay particular attention to the issue of State aid provision for such partnerships and, thereby, provide legal guidance on all issues regarding the applicability of State aid rules in this context and calls, in particular, for appropriate rules to simplify the use of public-private partnerships; submits that special care should be taken in this connection to ensure that transparency is maintained;\n",
        "30.Notes the exemption of smaller public service companies from the application of the State aid rules; wonders, however, whether the distinction between small and large undertakings in the assessment of State aid rules is adequate; pleads, therefore, for the Commission's assessment to be based on the effects of State aid measures on the relevant market rather than on the size of the public service company involved;\n",
        "31.Supports the adoption of a general block exemption regulation by the Commission in order to simplify and consolidate the existing block exemptions, notably on training, SMEs and employment, and to integrate a broader range of exemptions, notably as regards State aid to support SMEs and R&D, so long as cross-subsidisation from small to large enterprises is monitored and prohibited as appropriate; agrees with the Commission’s aim of focusing its resources on tackling the most distortional aids; considers that the notification procedures and delays inherent therein should be proportionate to the risk of serious distortion of competition arising from the aid in question; opines that a single legal instrument could also facilitate future extensions of the block exemption concept, such that smaller amounts of each type of aid need no longer be notified;\n",
        "32.Stresses the need to ensure that a general block exemption regulation leads to a true simplification of the procedure, with clear, detailed and unambiguous provisions which do not compromise the overriding aim of a general reduction in State aid;\n",
        "33.Welcomes the proposal to raise thede minimisthreshold; suggests that the figure be doubled, to € 200 000; asks the Commission in this context to address the problem of cumulation control;\n",
        "34.Welcomes the proposal from the Commission to review its guidelines on national regional aid; advocates that such a review be closely linked with the reform of the structural fund regulations for the period 2007-2013; stresses that regional aid reform should give greater consideration to territorial criteria so as to distinguish geographical areas of the EU with a strong economy from areas experiencing industrial conversion difficulties and areas with permanent natural handicaps; views cohesion and State aid policies as complementary: State aid policies have proved to be an effective instrument on the way towards the genuine convergence of incomes across the EU;\n",
        "35.Considers that State aid should be permitted only where the aid adds value that no other political measure can achieve and is for the benefit of a region; therefore supports a more efficient approach to granting regional aid, with a focus on investments in infrastructure and horizontal aid in disadvantaged or the least developed regions of the EU, including the introduction of advantageous tax conditions for transitional periods not exceeding five years; in this connection, highlights the need to maintain appropriate support measures for \"statistical effect\" regions;\n",
        "36.Considers that there should be a review of the reductions in State aid to the \"statistical effect\" regions, which have benefited from a relative increase in income as a result of enlargement but which have not achieved real growth or convergence and which suffer a high unemployment rate;\n",
        "37.Calls on the Commission, in view of the EU’s objectives as well as its cohesion policy, which is designed to achieve economic and social convergence through measures aimed at redressing imbalances between EU’s regions, to ensure that State aid does not result in a distortion of competition between Member States’ regions and does not finance intra-EU relocation, leading, in particular, to jobs being lost in one region for the benefit of another;\n",
        "38.Encourages the Commission, in line with the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, to assess in greater depth and detail the different types of State aid and their effectiveness so that it can indicate whether certain forms of aid are more advantageous than others as regards any lasting, positive impact they may have on regional development;\n",
        "39.Asks the Commission to apply the principles outlined in the State aid reform roadmap also to the specific rules applicable to certain sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, coal production and transport, which are often concentrated in areas eligible for structural funds, and to make more suggestions focused on reforming these specific rules;\n",
        "40.Considers that environmental State aid, where fair and transparent in its application, can play a crucial role in achieving the goal of sustainable development in the EU, particularly by stimulating investment in technology over the long term and its patenting of such technology in the EU, in line with the objective of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions laid down in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change;\n",
        "41.Considers that, as mentioned in the Commission communication Stimulating Technologies for Sustainable Development: An Environmental Technologies Action Plan for the European Union of 28 January 2004 (COM(2004)0038), current guidelines on State aid for environmental protection are \"not properly adapted to the increasing sophistication of investments in environmental technologies, nor to new forms of public/private partnership\"[11];\n",
        "42.Welcomes, therefore, the start of the stakeholder process with a view to revising these guidelines, which are set to expire by the end of 2007;\n",
        "43.Considers that the current practices and procedures of State aid policy have certain shortcomings and are too bureaucratic;\n",
        "44.Welcomes, therefore, the introduction of best practice guidelines on State aid procedures for speedier and more efficient notification procedures; questions, in this context, if a regulation might not be more appropriate than guidelines to achieve this aim;\n",
        "45.Strongly supports the idea of forming a closer network of supervisory authorities, such as courts of auditors, in the Member States, which could facilitate the objective of consistency in the application of State aid rules;\n",
        "46.Stresses that any decentralisation of competence in favour of national authorities requires rigorous monitoring and coordination to ensure that the rules are applied consistently in all Member States; considers that decentralisation could risk resulting in the inconsistent enforcement of State aid rules, in particular given the varying structures and levels of experience and expertise of Member States' competent authorities; underlines the importance of a functioning network between the competent authorities in the Member States;\n",
        "47.Urges the Commission to set clear time limits for State aid proceedings, including compliance;\n",
        "48.Expresses its discontent that sanctions for non-notification are currently enforced only against beneficiaries and not against Member States; supports the Commission, therefore, in exploring new deterrent mechanisms with a view addressing the incorrect implementation of the State aid rules by Member States, and invites the Commission to provide for appropriate sanctions in this regard;\n",
        "49.Renews its call for the codecision procedure to be introduced for all competition policy matters which the Council decides by qualified majority; 0 0       0\n",
        "50.Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.\n"
