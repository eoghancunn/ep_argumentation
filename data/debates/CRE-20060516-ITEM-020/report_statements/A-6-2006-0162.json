    "paragraphs": [
        "1.       Expresses its concern about, first, the persistently slow growth in Europe since 2002, accelerating, in the euro zone, only gradually from 0,6% in 2003 to 1,3% in 2005, in contrast with the growth rates of the USA of 3,5% in 2005 and the rebound of Japan's economy driven by private final domestic demand, second, the persistently high unemployment of 9% in EU-25 and 8,1% in EU-15 and, third, about the output gap, currently at -1% of GDP, demonstrating that EU economic growth remains substantially below long-term potential, constrained by structural rigidities, weak internal demand, and a lack of proper balance in the macroeconomic policy mix; stresses that the European economy's potential for growth remains excessively low, at about 2%, a figure much lower than that registered elsewhere in the world; considers that this potential for growth is insufficient for job creation and reducing unemployment rates or for the development of the enlarged Union;\n",
        "2.      Stresses the risk of rapid adjustments to the global imbalances which could lead to a decrease in demand in the US thus resulting in lower exports and weaker growth in the EU, and stresses that this effect could be further magnified by fluctuations in the euro exchange rate against the US dollar;\n",
        "3.      Notes the adverse implications of oil-price volatility and increases on internal demand and growth in the EU and the threat of its secondary effects; welcomes the responsible behaviour of social and economic actors to prevent these implications, notwithstanding weak household consumption; points out that a stable, outward-looking and competitive macro-economic policy-setting is a necessary precondition for a sustainable public finance policy;\n",
        "4.      Expresses its concern in regard to weak private consumption, especially in certain Member States, which has contributed to low growth rates in the EU and thus to the current global imbalances, and which is due to the prevailing climate of uncertainty about jobs and pensions, the persistent high level of unemployment, and the slow growth of real wages; recalls the commitment to promote nominal wages and labour cost developments consistent with price stability and the trend in productivity over the medium term in Integrated Guideline 4;\n",
        "5.      Welcomes the upturn in the pace of investment expenditure due to the revival of confidence among entrepreneurs and current stabilised profit margins, as referred to in the Autumn 2005 economic outlooks of both the IMF and the Commission; considers that there is still room and need for further acceleration in investment activity and thus calls for structural reforms and additional measures that would permanently improve the investment climate and boost investments;\n",
        "6.      Calls for the reorientation of public expenditure towards physical and human capital accumulation and the creation of public-private partnerships operating in areas of innovation, renewable energies, education and training, research, information technologies, telecommunication, and transportation networks etc;\n",
        "7.      Regrets that the EU Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 does not reflect sufficiently the priority given to the expenditures in the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy; stresses that the contributions to the European budget should be considered against future benefits taking into account their positive spill-over and leverage effects, providing the EU budget is sufficiently orientated towards expenditures bringing clear added value;\n",
        "8.      Notes that healthy public finances is not a goal in itself but a means by which Member States meet their public duties; stresses the importance of healthier fiscal positions for qualitative growth, job creation and the Lisbon Strategy but notes that, owing to the incorrect application of the Stability and Growth Pact in spite of the fiscal framework, no significant improvement regarding the Member States' fiscal positions has been achieved since last year; notes that most Member States, whether or not participating in the euro zone, have not yet achieved the medium-term objectives as regards their balance of payments; notes that the deficit for 2005 reached 2.9% of GDP in the euro zone and 2.7% across the EU, and that eleven Member States have deficits exceeding 3% of GDP, among which are the four largest EU economies, namely France, Germany, Italy and the UK, and that since summer 2004, ten Member States have been subject to the excessive deficit procedure;\n",
        "9.      Stresses the importance of actions to address persistent fiscal pressures; welcomes Member State authorities' articulation of policies and public commitments to reduce fiscal deficits;\n",
        "10.    Expresses its concern about the prospects of long-term budgetary sustainability considering the increase of public debt ratios from 69,2% in 2002 to 71,7% in 2005 in the euro zone and from 61,4% in 2002 to 64,1% in 2005 in EU-25, due to the weak growth of GDP  and the lack of determined effort to reduce budgetary imbalances through structural reforms;\n",
        "11.    Stresses that in the context of an EU with low consumer and investor confidence, it is vital to correct public deficits; is disappointed by the recent trends in public finances, noting that the Member States' deficits remain much higher than required by the European economy; notes that governments are using the low growth argument to justify the deficits,,despite the fact that the deficits are impeding economic recovery and making the cycle more acute; calls for a reduction in public deficits in 2006 which is much more ambitious than a mere economic adjustment made in anticipation of higher European growth;\n",
        "12.    Calls for more transparency in the public finances of individual Member States, including the as regards implicit liabilities such as public sector pension commitments, which will significantly raise the burden of debt of the public sector over the coming years;\n",
        "13.    Recalls its demand to avoid pro-cyclical policies; stresses the importance of undertaking structural and tax reforms and simultaneously underlines that due attention should be paid to their proper timing;\n",
        "14.    Encourages further research into the different kinds and measures of structural and macroeconomic reforms and their interaction and mutual impact at different phases of the economic cycle in order to identify the best possible means of strengthening public finances while at the same time realising the Lisbon Strategy;\n",
        "15.    Underlines that the lack of political will to contain public spending, overoptimistic revenue projections, creative accounting, and fiscal consolidation based mainly on one-off measures, have largely contributed to budgetary slippage and the weakness of the fiscal framework ;\n",
        "16.    Recommends exploring whether to set a uniform calendar for budgetary procedures across the EU, possibly on a biannual basis; takes the view that the Member States’ budget planning must be based on uniform assumptions regarding key economic parameters such as trends in oil prices and exchange rates; thus calls for key economic parameters to be uniformly assessed and established across the EU;\n",
        "17.    Calls upon the Member States to address urgently the challenge of an ageing society and to cope with the debt dynamics in particular in the Member States facing serious risks to long-term sustainability;\n",
        "18.    Encourages a stronger focus on sustainability in budgetary reforms, as regards both expenditure and revenue measures, preserving sustainable public finance positions and the adequate provision of public services including fiscal discipline and the risks of explicit and implicit contingent liabilities;\n",
        "19.    Welcomes the efforts of the Commission and the Council to improve statistical governance improving the reporting of fiscal data with a recommendation to Member States on EU-wide standards concerning statistical institutes, including principles on professional independence, the confidentiality, reliability, and timeliness of data, and the adequacy of resources of statistical institutes and improved monitoring rights for the Commission;\n",
        "20.    Considers that there is room for improvement in the accounting of public assets and implicit liabilities in order to increase transparency and comparability and to provide a sounder basis for taking decisions; considers that the Commission should launch an initiative in this field;\n",
        "21.    Recommends that the Commission prepare a study on best practices concerning the statistical governance of fiscal data reporting and the accounting of public assets and liabilities in Member States;\n",
        "22.    Encourages the production of national reports on the long-term sustainability of public finances in order to increase awareness and credibility of national commitments and deems that national parliaments should be involved in such an exercise;\n",
        "23.    Stresses the importance for the new Member States’ fiscal policies to catch up with average EU income levels and financial development through tax and expenditure policies characterised by efficiency, transparency and reliability and geared towards increased growth, sustainability, and towards both modernising and stabilising the economy;\n",
        "24.     Deplores the lack of policy coordination in the euro zone and draws attention to the divergence in fiscal policies of the Member States in the euro zone and is concerned about possible antagonistic effects of such a lack of coordination;\n",
        "25.    Regrets deficiencies in the current framework of macroeconomic coordination within the ECOFIN Council, as well as the lack of coordination among the Member States; calls on the Commission to carry out a study concerning the economic advantages and limitations of greater economic policy coordination; calls for a more active macro-economic dialogue under the Cologne process between ECOFIN, the ECB and the European social partners;\n",
        "26.    Calls on the Council to adjust the timetable for macroeconomic coordination to enable the Parliament to have sufficient time to submit its contribution;\n",
        "27.    Calls on the Eurogroup chairman to propose a detailed action plan for the duration of his term of office, clearly defining his objectives and planned measures; expects regular reports on the level of implementation achieved;\n",
        "28.    Calls upon the Member States to assume their obligation under Article 99 of the Treaty to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate those policies; reminds the Member States that better coordinated policies and a better policy mix could improve the aggregate result of their policies; calls for more awareness of the impact of national economic policy at the EU level and of the obligation to consider economic policy of common interest and to coordinate such policy;\n",
        "29.    Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the parliaments of the Member States, and the European social partners.\n"
