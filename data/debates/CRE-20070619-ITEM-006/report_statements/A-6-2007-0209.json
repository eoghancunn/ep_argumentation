        "32.      Calls on the Member States to consider, with reference to their national situation, whether a reform of their education system to encourage flexibility and better management of time spent in education would have the effect of enabling young people to begin their working lives at an earlier stage and to achieve their desire for parenthood;\n",
        "33.      Encourages EUROSTAT and the Member States to adjust existing indicators with a view to gathering data which would make it possible to determine - at both MemberState and European level - the number of students with family responsibilities, their living conditions and the extent to which family responsibilities are a factor in them abandoning their studies, particularly in the case of young women;\n",
        "34.      Stresses that the incentives for young women to study and start a family may also diminish because they are afraid of suffering discrimination at work at a later stage; calls, therefore, on the Member States to combat the discriminatory treatment of mothers by employers when recruiting and promoting staff;\n",
