{"speaker": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). –", "english": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, policymakers have concentrated for several decades on getting women into the workplace and on breaking down gender bias and promotion in jobs. Education has always been seen as a tool in this.\nIn this resolution, however, I think we have failed to look at the difficulties women face in reconciling the rest of their lives which have been glossed over. Women were almost forced to forego childbearing, and if they did bear children, they were forced to forego childrearing. If they did choose to rear their children, they were asked to be superhuman to do it. Thankfully, women are now forcing us to look at changing this and making things more flexible so that they can reconcile family, work and education. We must be flexible. We must help women to combine these things. Or we must even allow women the opportunity to take time off, if they should so choose, in order to have children and to rear them, in the security of knowing that the opportunities will be there when they choose to resume their place in the workplace.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM). – Mr President, policymakers have concentrated for several decades on getting women into the workplace and on breaking down gender bias and promotion in jobs.
