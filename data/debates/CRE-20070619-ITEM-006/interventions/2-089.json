{"speaker": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). –", "english": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, what is the best time to have a child? There is no simple answer to this question, and women have to balance having children with work and education demands.\nThe Lisbon Agenda is well known for its goal that by 2010 Europe should become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth together with quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater social cohesion. It has been calculated that this would increase the overall employment rate in the EU to 70% and the employment rate for women to more than 60% by 2010.\nThis has obvious implications for women and decisions about family, work and education. Education and training have obvious benefits for individuals and society as a whole. At the same time, women often delay having children because of the demands of work and study. I welcome the Commission’s recognition in its recent communication on reconciling professional, private and family life, that public policy should also be addressed to young women and men who are still in higher education.\nWe need to make it easier to combine family life with studying. Unfortunately, few EU countries have a range of social and economic measures to help the students who are parents. Students with family responsibilities face considerable difficulties in their university courses and their daily lives. They have special needs, in particular with regard to housing, childcare services and course flexibility. This particularly affects women, as they are more likely to give up studies due to childcare commitments. This builds in disadvantages for women which we have to address.\nI urge colleagues to support this report.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Mr President, what is the best time to have a child?
