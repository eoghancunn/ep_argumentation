    "paragraphs": [
        "1.  Recognises that access to raw materials and commodities is vital for the EU economy, due to its lack of domestic supply of several raw materials;\n",
        "2.  Notes with concern the prospects of an increasing demand for raw materials on world markets; is worried about the limits of exploration capacity for the near future; takes note of the limited involvement of European companies in the exploration of raw materials in third countries;\n",
        "3.   Is concerned about the trend to restrict free access to raw materials in third countries by trade distorting measures, recognises however the right of countries to restrict access to their raw materials for environmental purposes or to address critical shortages of supply when necessary; this right must be exercised in conjunction with other domestic measures;\n",
        "4.  Is concerned about those investment activities aimed at better access to raw materials which neither comply with standards of fair and free competition nor to the principles of good governance and sustainability,\n",
        "5.  Asks the Commission to promote investment in research and development in technologies for the recycling of raw materials and the efficient and economic use of raw materials; calls on the Commission and the Member States to give more weight to this objective in their research activities;\n",
        "6.   Urges the Commission to address the issue of free and fair access to raw material markets in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO); asks the Commission to pursue actively the objective of multilateral elimination of trade distorting measures in the sector of raw materials, while fully respecting restrictions based on developmental grounds for least developed countries (LDCs);\n",
        "7.   Asks the Commission to give more weight to the issue of free and non-discriminatory access to raw material markets in all bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements or WTO accessions; sets out the objective of abandoning all trade distorting measures in the sector of raw materials as an important objective in all possible agreements, while fully respecting developmental goals; stresses that this objective will serve as an important criterion in the evaluation of all possible agreements by the European Parliament;\n",
        "8.  Asks the Commission to include the issue of raw materials in the market access strategy; welcomes the consultation on the supply of raw materials; calls on the Commission to elaborate a coherent strategy on the supply of raw materials; asks to be involved in all phases of these activities,\n",
        "9.  Regrets that many developing countries and in particular LDCs have been locked into the production and export of raw materials and commodities whose volatile prices have been declining over the long term, constituting a serious impediment to the alleviation of poverty as well as the realisation of the MDGs but recognises that increasing commodity prices have contributed to significant improvements in the external accounts of some developing countries, dependent on primary commodities; underlines the opportunities for the producer countries which lay in the own exploration and management of raw material deposits when fundamental rules of transparency and fair competition are respected;\n",
        "10. Calls on the Commission to seek the effective elimination of the causes of distortions by firmly raising these issues in bilateral consultations and negotiations and to promote the development of new WTO rules at a multilateral level;\n",
        "11. Supports current efforts in developing countries and in particular in LDCs to diversify their economies and develop economic activities at more advanced stages of the production process, to also include processing and marketing and to enhance the quality, productivity and production of products with a higher degree of value added; urges the Commission to support national commodity development and diversification strategies with support from the European Development Fund when necessary;\n",
        "12. Considers the set-up of regional economic frameworks and increased regional cooperation among developing countries to be of the utmost importance for the sustainable economic development of those countries; underlines in this respect the importance of south-south trade for the economic development of those countries;\n",
        "13. Considers that in the long term regional economic and trade cooperation should be fostered and could lead to free trade agreements; notes at the same time that in different regional contexts free trade agreements face difficulties; considers that the EuroMed free trade agreement should be a priority given the importance of trade in raw materials in this region;\n",
        "14. Encourages developing countries and in particular LDCs to raise the necessary investments and consolidate economic diversification through strengthened infrastructure and institutional capacity building, promoting good governance in managing economic development as well as facilitating access and distribution of products from small scale producers to local markets which also would strengthen regional integration and economies of scale, urges the Commission to use aid-for-trade as an important tool for development as well as strengthen existing mechanisms for transfer of technology, especially as a means to manage climate change; asks the Commission to promote transparency of the revenues stemming from raw materials via programmes like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process;\n",
        "15. Encourages the Commission and EU companies to promote and invest in the transfer of environmentally friendly technologies;\n",
        "16. Recognises that the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations would significantly reduce tariff escalation; notes that the European Union has already phased out its tariffs on agricultural products from the LDCs (through the Everything But Arms initiative) and from many ACP countries (through Economic Partnership Agreements) and supports developing countries in identifying and implementing rules regarding special products and effective safeguard mechanisms for the sustainability of their markets and production;\n",
        "17. Asks the European Union's Member States as well as partners around the world, including the emerging economies, to ratify core International Labour Organisation labour standards and relevant Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines, especially regarding the exploration and refining of raw materials; believes that the involvement of civil society and national parliaments is crucial to achieve environmental and socio-economic sustainable development;\n",
        "18. Calls on the Commission to implement a comprehensive and balanced strategy in the field of access to raw materials taking into account the interests of EU industry and developing countries;\n",
        "19. Calls on the Commission to review its compensatory finance scheme, FLEX, to ensure it is responsive and effective in supporting developing countries and in particular LDCs; believes there is a need for relevant measures to be taken at national level in order to support the work being done by UNCTAD;\n",
        "20. Calls on the Commission to collect data and generate statistics on international trade in raw materials and commodities that takes place in real terms; believes that there is a need to get a clear picture of global trade flows in commodities and raw materials not falsified by purely speculative transactions in order to better target economic policy measures;\n",
        "21. Recognises that liberalisation of trade in agricultural food products and agricultural primary commodities has exposed small scale farmers in developing countries and in particular in LDCs to many new challenges. As small scale farmers are largely comprised of women, this can have a disproportionately negative effect on them if they are not able to cope with external competition;\n",
        "22. Supports developing countries in their endeavours to secure access to food for the local populations; believes that viable policy space must be further strengthened to enable national rules and measures for the development of this sector, as well as support women who carry the main responsibility for feeding their families and the local communities;\n",
        "23. Calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements signed by the European Union are in accordance with the objective of sustainable development; calls on the Commission to take the necessary legislative measures to ensure the integration of its trade Sustainable Impact Assessments in developing the EU's trade policy, in particular from a climate, gender and sustainable development perspective;\n",
        "24. Welcomes the Commission's announcement to present a Communication in 2008 aimed at improving conditions of sustainable access to minerals and secondary raw materials at EU and international level;\n",
        "25. Takes note of the increased criticism regarding the economic and environmental benefits of agro fuel production;calls on the Commission to stimulate research and innovation on sustainable raw material supplythrough efficient resource extraction and development, material use and recovery of end of life;\n",
        "26. Believes that the extraction, gathering and production of raw materials and commodities should be done in accordance with the principle of sustainability, which respects the natural processes of the ecosystems instead of altering them;\n",
        "27. Urges the Commission to step up its efforts to obtain an international agreement on conflict resources whose primary objective would be to prohibit all trade in resources fuelling or resulting from armed conflicts, insists in the meantime on the development of a regulation prohibiting the trading and marketing of conflict resources in the European Union and urges all countries involved in the diamond trade to subscribe fully to the Kimberley certification scheme for international trade in rough diamonds; calls for the promotion of transparency via the EITI and other initiatives;\n",
        "28. Renews its call on the Commission and the Council to promote Fair Trade, and other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards in supporting small and marginalised producers in developing countries, encourages public authorities in the European Union to integrate Fair Trade and sustainability criteria into their public tenders and purchasing policies;\n",
        "29. Is concerned that a growing proportion of the earth's resources are used for livestock raising; recalls the FAO report 'Livestock's Long Shadow' from November 2006 which estimates that the meat industry and livestock raising contribute 18% to the world's total greenhouse gas emissions, which also accelerate deforestation in developing countries; calls on the Commission to take the necessary action within this sector as well as to establish incentive mechanisms to avoid deforestation within the framework of international climate negotiations;\n",
        "30. Believes that the EITI, which aims to strengthen governance by improving transparency and accountability in the extractives sector shall be implemented world wide, in order to provide better opportunities for developing countries to receive the equivalent value of their natural resources;\n",
        "31. Stresses that high oil prices reinforce the need for an urgent and different approach in energy policy aiming at improving energy efficiency and increased use of other energy sources, including renewable energy;\n",
        "32. Realises that climate change will hit hardest the communities that already face significant social and economic problems; understands that especially women are a particularly vulnerable group; encourages efforts to adapt at local level through relevant financial and technical international support; 33 Is concerned that China does not allow foreign companies to have a majority stake in sectors such as steel and has introduced a variety of mechanisms that restrict the export of metals raw materials or provide governmental support for buying them from external sources; recognises that such practices create serious difficulties for EU industry and must be tackled using all available instruments, including through reinforced dialogue; 34 Points out that the new trading policy of some emerging countries, especially China, searching for raw materials worldwide, in particular in Africa, is having a major and negative impact on the European Union's access to commodities in this continent, because of an approach based on one-to-one relations between states and neglecting references to human rights, corporate social responsibility and environmental and social standards;\n",
        "35. Welcomes the Commission's initiative to continue to use all existing instruments to address trade practices in violation of international trade agreements as announced in its above-mentioned CommunicationCOM(2008)0108;\n",
        "36. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and relevant international organisations such as UNCTAD, the WTO, the World Bank, the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) and the FAO.\n"
