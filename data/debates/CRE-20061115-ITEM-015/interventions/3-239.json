We have a concern about the supply of gas from Russia to Europe.\nThirdly, we invite Northern Dimension member countries to be aware of the importance of two EU programmes in our committee’s area of responsibility: Galileo and SESAR, because we believe that the commitment of northern dimension parties to both of these would reinforce sustainable growth and competitiveness in the region.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Giles Chichester (PPE-DE), Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy . – Mr President, I would like to focus on three of the issues raised in my committee’s opinion.\nFirst, I would like to stress our view of the importance of further exploitation of offshore wind energy in the Baltic and the demonstration of different types of wave energy concepts.\nSecondly, I would like to emphasise the importance of developing further cooperation with Russia.
