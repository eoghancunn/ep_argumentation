{"speaker": "Christopher Beazley,", "english": "Christopher Beazley, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – My prepared speech has been brilliantly summarised by Mr Stubb, the rapporteur, so I should simply like to put two questions.\nFirst of all to the Minister, Mrs Lehtomäki, would she accept that, as the debate has already underlined, circumstances have completely changed since Finland first devised the Northern Dimension? In other words, there are now eight EU Member States, not four, around the Baltic Sea, not all of which see the Northern Dimension in the same light. The reason, for example, that the EU-Russia embellishment process has been stalled, as we know, is that Poland has a reserve over Russia’s refusal to ratify the Energy Charter. So would she accept that it would be very helpful at the Council of Ministers, at the preparatory phase of the Northern Dimension discussions and negotiations, first to have an internal EU discussion involving the eight EU Baltic States?\nSecondly, I am very grateful to Commissioner Wallström for her comments and for agreeing to incorporate much of the report into the Commission’s thinking about evolving and developing the Northern Dimension into the future. But she did, I think, neglect to refer to the budget. It seems to me that this is not a question of Parliament coming cap in hand, begging for support. We are, after all, an arm of the EU’s budgetary authority; it therefore seems to me logical and coherent that, if this is going to be an important element, there would be mechanisms and systems whereby, just as in other parts of the EU – EuroMed for example – we have a dedicated budget. We should give serious consideration to this and not brush it under the carpet.\nMy final point is addressed again to Commissioner Wallström, and concerns communication, which is her brief. It seems that this is an exercise which can bring a real message of accomplishment and achievement to the citizens of the EU, to show that a region dislocated completely by the Cold War can now have harmony, prosperity and stability restored. So I think this debate should be taken out into the field, to the public, to show a real success story for the EU.\n(Applause)", "lang": "EN", "original": "Christopher Beazley, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . – My prepared speech has been brilliantly summarised by Mr Stubb, the rapporteur, so I should simply like to put two questions.\nFirst of all to the Minister, Mrs Lehtomäki, would she accept that, as the debate has already underlined, circumstances have completely changed since Finland first devised the Northern Dimension?
