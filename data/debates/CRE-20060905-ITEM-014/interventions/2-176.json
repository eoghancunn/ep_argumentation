{"speaker": "Paula Lehtomäki,", "english": "Paula Lehtomäki, President-in-Office of the Council . (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to say that I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss Europe’s social future with you. This is obviously a very important subject as far as the citizens of Europe are concerned.\nThe Heads of State of the European Union have repeatedly confirmed their commitment to European values and the development of European social models. The European social model, which is capable of combining economic growth, low levels of unemployment and social cohesion, provides a solid base on which to look for answers to the challenges of globalisation and an ageing population.\nThe European social model also needs to be reviewed constantly. We have to make it easier for our citizens to adapt to change. We have to show our support for European competitiveness and higher levels of employment and, furthermore, combat poverty and exclusion. We have to make sure that the systems for social protection are sustainable in the long term and at an adequate level. All these aims support one another reciprocally.\nIt is vital to the future of a social Europe that the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment is assiduously put into effect. If the European welfare societies are to remain, there need to be better competitiveness, lower rates of unemployment and higher productivity. One of the objectives of the Finnish Presidency is to reinforce the basis for economic growth in Europe.\nOver the coming weeks we are expecting the Commission to present a communication on demographic change in Europe. These issues were discussed at an informal meeting of EU Ministers for Employment, Social Affairs and Health in Helsinki in July. One of the Finnish Presidency’s conclusions from these talks was that the change in the population’s age structure should not be regarded as merely a challenge: it is also an indication of how well the European welfare model works. Large sections of the population have the chance of a longer, healthier life. Although the conclusions relating to the potential for economic growth and the sustainability of public finances may well be less positive, a long-term, proactive policy of reform is essential.\nThe job market debate is a fundamental part of the European social model. The Finnish Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen, and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, will host an extraordinary tripartite Social Summit in Lahti on 20 October. Its purpose is to continue the debate on managing structural change in Europe. We need to find a balance between flexibility and security and invest heavily in skills and expertise. By making it easier for men and women to harmonise work with family life we will be creating at the same time a more effective response for Europe to the challenges of globalisation and an ageing population. This harmonisation of work and family life is also fundamentally linked to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. This was highlighted at the European Council in spring 2006 when it adopted the European Pact for Gender Equality.\nThe Union is a key global player whose aim is the promotion of democracy, human rights and sustainable development. The Commission has just presented a communication on the subject of ‘decent’ work. It is very important for the EU and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to cooperate on this matter. The worldwide promotion of decent work will also boost productivity in the less developed countries.\nDuring its Presidency, Finland wants to strengthen the European Union’s ability to adapt to the pressures of global competition. Improving European competitiveness is closely linked to the preservation of the European welfare societies. Europe can be both competitive and strong socially, but this will require us to make continued efforts and be prepared for change.\nAs Prime Minister Vanhanen said here in the European Parliament plenary in July, we also have to take seriously the fear that Europeans have of global competition. Common values and social justice will play a central role in allaying such fears.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Paula Lehtomäki, President-in-Office of the Council .
