Both of those propositions are utterly discredited and if you look at the figures for poverty, for homelessness and for social dislocation in this Union, you will understand why.\nThe reality is that social Europe has been very much a ‘frill’ or an ‘add-on’ to the broader game plan of this Union. I believe that, if we are to have a real and fruitful discussion about social policy, we have to ask the fundamental questions and the difficult questions relating to EU macroeconomic policy. What has the effect of liberalisation and privatisation been on those who are marginalised? What about the creeping abandonment of the welfare state?
