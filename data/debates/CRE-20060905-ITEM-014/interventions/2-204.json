{"speaker": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). –", "english": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the co-rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, talked about the need for a ‘decent society’. That phrase was very much paralleled and echoed by the Council when talking about the need for ‘social justice’. I hope that on all sides of the House people would agree on the importance of those phrases and agree that they should not just be empty phrases but concepts of real meaning. I hope also that people on both sides of this House would recognise the importance of their applying to everybody in real social inclusion. In other words, that they should apply not just to those people who are in work, not just to those people who are not able to work, but also to those people who want to work but are unable to find work because there are too many obstacles in their way.\nThat is why I would also like to congratulate – in addition to the first co-rapporteur – the other co-rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda. When he spoke he referred to the need to reform the social model. That phrase was picked up by the Commissioner himself, who talked about the need for reform. What particularly impressed me about the Commissioner’s remarks was that he said that the status quo is not an option. He specifically referred to the 20 million unemployed, because they are indeed a constant reminder of the biggest social injustice of all. Something has to be done. We must help to do it.\nTo my mind the key word is ‘reform’. I have tabled an amendment, with the help of a dozen or so colleagues from different countries, to insert into Amendment 1 on recital F the phrase ‘modernisation and reform’. The good news is that Mr Hughes has confirmed to me this afternoon that the PSE Group will support that phrase. We have the chance, as a House, to show that we all support that phrase and that it is not empty of meaning, but a phrase of substance. Our constituents want reform. Let us show tomorrow that we want it and are going to vote for it too.", "lang": "EN", "original": "Philip Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE). – Mr President, the co-rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, talked about the need for a ‘decent society’.
