        "9.  asks the Commission to take further initiatives to achieve the full implementation of the internal market, which, if fully realised, will create economic growth and competitiveness, having regard to the need to exclude any race to the bottom in social, consumer or environmental conditions;\n",

        "19. is aware that in some Member States current contributions to social protection systems may be inadequate to meet citizens' expectations; considers that Member States, while respecting the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity, should reflect  on alternativewaysto finance those systems which would promote dynamic reforms while not adversely affecting wages, such as by harnessing the added value produced by companies;\n",
        "20. calls for improved coordination of Member States' tax policies with a view to avoiding harmful tax competition, ensuring sustainable financing for social protection and making tax policy more employment friendly; notes the fact that tax rates on capital and consumption have, in general, remained stable over the last 30 years while real tax rates on labour have risen over the same period, recommends that the Member States reflect in a coordinated way on the possibilities of improving the existing tax systems in the Union, since tax reforms of this nature would benefit financial sustainability of national social systems;\n",
