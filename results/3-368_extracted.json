  "original_text": "Jean-Claude Martinez, on behalf of the ITS Group. – (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the reports by our two colleagues, including the one by Mrs Fraga, relate to this insoluble problem of fisheries – insoluble because fish stocks are limited and demand is constantly increasing. Consequently, the fisheries policy is not the CAP.\nSince 1968 and Sicco Mansholt, the Commission has for 40 years been making a strategic mistake with the CAP, which amounts to a crime against humanity: humanity needs cereals and milk and they are in short supply as the increase in prices shows.\nWith fisheries policy it is different. The Commission’s mistakes simply come from its normal, technocratic sin, but not from a strategic crime. Management of fish stocks with TACs, quotas, FIFGs and MAGPs has failed. The Commission has legislated on everything: nets, tonnages, fleet power, number of units and when all is said and done – as the rapporteur tells us – there are fewer fishermen, less cod and even less bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, hence the fury of fishermen in June and July. Where I come from, for example, in the port of Sète or Le Grau-du-Roi, the fishermen who use thonaille fishing, which is traditional coastal fishing with small nets, were protesting that they could not fish from July onwards.\nNevertheless, despite all these checks, all this destruction, all these sanctions – perhaps one day they will even put electronic tags on fishermen to monitor them – the stocks are in danger, the rapporteur tells us. The Common Fisheries Policy has not worked, and why? Because the problem is worldwide: China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Peru fish. As with wine, where we are pulling up as the rest of the world is planting, we are breaking up our boats as the United States are building more of them and as Russia, Iceland and Norway are increasing the engine size of their vessels.\nYou can invent indicators, a type of maximum sustainable yield, but if your neighbour is fishing more, you fishing less will not improve stocks. Moreover, because farming, or aquaculture, is not a real solution either because of fishmeal, fisheries is therefore the perfect demonstration that the Community level is both too high when the fishing is coastal and the decision should be local, or too low when the fishing is deep-sea. In these cases, either we will very quickly rise to global level with the help of scientists, or by the end of the twenty-first century, we will be going to the cinema to fish for the last Nemos.",
  "extracted_arguments": "assistant\n\n<argument>La politique des pêches n'est pas une politique agricole. Depuis 1968 et Sicco Mansholt, la commission a pour 40 ans fait un grand écart stratégique avec la PMA, qui est un crime contre l'humanité : les humains ont besoin de céréales et de lait, ils sont en déficit comme le montrent les hausses de prix. La politique des pêches est différente ; les erreurs de la commission proviennent simplement du vice technique ordinaire mais non d'un crime stratégique.</argument>\n<claim>CAP cannot solve fisheries problems; separate policies needed for each sector.</claim>\n<explanation>The author presents a strong counterfactual argument based on the difference between agriculture and fisheries, arguing that the Commission's strategy for CAP has led to a 'crime against humanity', whereas the same approach fails for fisheries due to differences in nature and global scale of the issue.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.98</confidence>\n\n<argument>You can invent indicators, a type of maximum sustainable yield, but if your neighbor is fishing more, you fishing less will not improve stocks.</argument>\n<claim>No single country can control its own fishing stock levels due to global competition.</claim>\n<explanation>This statement serves as an empirical refutation of the idea that controlling fishing stocks solely relies on technical means like indicators and rules, pointing out a structural flaw inherent in such approaches given the competitive international environment.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.92</confidence>\n\n<argument>Either we will very quickly rise to global level with the help of scientists, or by the end of the twenty-first century, we will be going to the cinema to fish for the last Nemos.</argument>\n<claim>Aquaculture is not a viable long-term solution due to resource constraints, requiring new global cooperation or facing extinction.</claim>\n<explanation>In contrast to previous statements that emphasize the limitations of individual action within current frameworks, this assertion takes a forward-looking perspective to describe an impending ecological disaster unless immediate collective action occurs at the global level.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.88</confidence>\n\n<argument>Where I come from, for example, in the port of Sète or Le Grau-du-Roi, the fishermen who use thonaille fishing, which is traditional coastal fishing with small nets, were protesting that they could not fish from July onwards.</argument>\n<claim>Traditional fishing methods face stricter regulations, harming local economies and threatening livelihoods.</claim>\n<explanation>The speaker appeals to personal experience and specific examples to argue against overly restrictive measures affecting small-scale, traditional fishing practices, emphasizing human impact rather than purely environmental concerns.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.75</confidence>\n\n<argument>Les stocks ne sont pas améliorés par vos déclarations, mesdames et messieurs les députés.</argument>\n<claim>Laws alone do not conserve marine life; drastic changes required in fishing habits.</claim>\n<explanation>This concise statement emphasizes the failure of legal regulations to protect fish populations and encourages broader societal change in fishing behaviors beyond mere legislative compliance.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.80</confidence>"
