  "agenda_item": "Sustainability in EU fisheries through maximum sustainable yield (debate)",
  "original_text": "Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . – (SV) Madam President, I can agree with much of what Mr Davies says. Fish are dying! When they die, there will be no income for fisherman. So it is much smarter to invest in the future by having maximum sustainable yields now, rather than a maximum available yield, which has been the Union’s policy so far. That is entirely unsustainable!\nThen we can discuss scientific gaps in methods and the fact that it is perhaps a blunt instrument. But the EU has low inflation as an overall target for economic policy and that is an extremely blunt instrument, but it has not been criticised in the same way. In such cases this is a much sharper instrument and for that I want to thank the Commissioner. You have realised that the policy is completely wrong, completely unsuccessful, and are now trying to put it right.\nLater we will be discussing the problem of discards and a combination of measures may perhaps begin to resolve the problems. But when we talk about socioeconomic assessments, we must have a longer time perspective. That is the thrust of my amendment. Without it, you might as well say, ‘Oh well, fishermen today do not want to do anything!’ To take away the jobs of the fishermen of all future generations, that is, if anything, a poor socioeconomic assessment.",
