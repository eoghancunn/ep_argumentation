  "original_text": "Catherine Stihler (PSE). – Madam President, few of us will dispute the importance of having long-term sustainability of commercial fish stocks. The EU signed up to the commitment made by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 to reach maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in fisheries by 2015 at the latest.\nIt is vital that we open up the debate on how to achieve the goal of reducing fishing pressure on vulnerable species, and this report by Ms Fraga Estévez is an important part of that process.\nThe merits of fishing at low levels of fishing mortality and building up a more robust spawning stock were also considered in the Net Benefits Report by the UK Prime Minister’s strategy unit.\nAs a Scot I am all too familiar with the pressures on vulnerable fishing stocks such as North Sea cod, and all the more with the practical difficulties of applying management plans in mixed fisheries areas such as off the Scottish coasts. The difficulties do not remove the obligation to act.\nI welcome the recognition by the Commission of the need for stakeholder involvement and that regional advisory councils (RACs) are included in the proposed process for taking this forward. Some of the RACs have already begun to consider long-term management and the issue of MSY, and it will be important that the strategy is developed in partnership with stakeholders.\nAt this stage we should not get too side-tracked by discussing the technicalities of what MSY actually is and how it should be applied. A more important focus is bringing fishing opportunities into better balance with available stocks for a more sustainable future.",
  "extracted_arguments": "assistant\n\n<argument>We should open up the debate on how to reduce fishing pressure on vulnerable species and apply management plans despite practical difficulties.</argument>\n<claim>Fishing pressure reduction requires debating its methods and application regardless of challenges.</claim>\n<explanation>This is an argument because it presents a call for discussion on a crucial aspect of achieving MSY while acknowledging existing obstacles, clearly framing the necessary action despite adversity.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.8</confidence>\n\n<argument>EU committed to reaching MSY in fisheries by 2015 but its meaning and application are secondary to actual implementation.</argument>\n<claim>Technical details around MSY are less relevant than executing management strategies for MSY attainment.</claim>\n<explanation>This constitutes an argument since it prioritizes concrete implementation over defining specifics of MSY criteria, thereby arguing that execution matters more than definition for meeting goals.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.7</confidence>\n\n<argument>It's essential to bring fishing opportunities into better balance with available stocks for a more sustainable future.</argument>\n<claim>Sustainable future necessitates balancing fishing opportunities with available resources.</claim>\n<explanation>This statement forms an argument as it directly emphasizes the necessity of aligning fishing capacity with resource availability to ensure a lasting ecological equilibrium.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.85</confidence>"
