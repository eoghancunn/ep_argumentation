  "original_text": "Avril Doyle, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – Madam President, I welcome Ms Fraga Estévez’s report, and particularly her highlighting of concerns on this proposal from the Commission, as I have serious reservations about the Commissioner’s proposals to adopt a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) model as the reference point for managing fish stocks.\nThe year 2015 is a political date, not a scientific one. It is too early for some stocks and is too late for others in the context of overfishing. While the proposal aims to maximise the economic yield of a fishery, and also maintain the capacity of the stock to produce maximum sustainable returns in the long-term, I fear that, far from reducing the levels of discarded catch, critical flaws in the model may cause over-exploitation, as the underlying assumptions used for calculating levels of catch are based on single-species, shallow-water fisheries and do not take account of geographic and biological diversity.\nI applaud the objective of increasing efficiency in protecting fish species, as all of us must do. But I believe that the Commission has not sufficiently researched this. There has been no in-depth evaluation of the risks of error in the MSY model. Moreover, for the large majority of scientists and also for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which encompass the ecosystem as a whole, rather than relying on an outdated concept of animal population dynamics.\nMSY is a blunt instrument, based on harvesting surplus production during high growth of population before it reaches carrying capacity. But it is one which can lead to overfishing when applied to multi-species fisheries, as you cannot obtain optimum levels of all species at the same time, or when it is applied to pelagic species that dwell in deep seas and open water such as the North Sea and the Atlantic.\nIf adopted, this model will simultaneously result in the collapse of stocks and the collapse of the market. I urge the Commissioner to take a sound, scientific and evidence-based approach. Your own words, Commissioner, are that you should not prejudice the scientific debate. I agree with you. Take a scientific, evidence-based approach and re-examine this proposal rather than – with respect – just dance, albeit belatedly, to the tune of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.",
  "extracted_arguments": "assistant\n\n<argument>The year 2015 is a political date, not a scientific one. It is too early for some stocks and is too late for others in the context of overfishing.</argument>\n<claim>Using MSY as a reference point may exacerbate overfishing due to its limitations.</claim>\n<explanation>The speaker explicitly argues against the MSY model as a flawed method for managing fish stocks, citing its inability to accommodate complex ecosystems and potential biases towards certain fishing practices, thereby providing a direct counterpoint to the proposed management strategy.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.85</confidence>\n\n<argument>I applaud the objective of increasing efficiency in protecting fish species, as all of us must do. But I believe that the Commission has not sufficiently researched this.</argument>\n<claim>The Commission lacks sufficient research to justify using the MSY model.</claim>\n<explanation>The speaker presents a conditional statement indicating that they support the protection of fish species but disagree with the commission's lack of thorough analysis regarding the MSY model, showing a nuanced critique within the larger discussion of fish conservation strategies.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.8</confidence>\n\n<argument>There has been no in-depth evaluation of the risks of error in the MSY model. Moreover, for the large majority of scientists and also for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which encompass the ecosystem as a whole, rather than relying on an outdated concept of animal population dynamics.</argument>\n<claim>Newer methods for managing fish populations offer advantages over the MSY model.</claim>\n<explanation>The speaker clearly articulates an objection to the MSY model due to its outdated methodology and failure to address ecological complexities, while emphasizing the superiority of contemporary management techniques supported by the broader scientific community.</explanation>\n<confidence>0.9</confidence>\n\n<argument>MSY is a blunt instrument, based on harvesting surplus production during high growth of population before it reaches carrying capacity.
